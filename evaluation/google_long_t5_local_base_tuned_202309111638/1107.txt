IntroductionDo acts of kindness improve the well-being of the actor? Over thepast few decades, advances in the behavioural sciences have developednumerous theories of human social, cooperative and altruistic beha-viour. These theories — kin altruism, mutualism, reciprocal altruism,and competitive altruism — make it possible to explain a variety ofdiﬀerent types of kindness (for example, love, sympathy, gratitude andheroism). And they predict that people will be ‘happy to help’ family,friends, community members, spouses, and even strangers under someconditions.More recently, there has been growing interest in using kindness asan intervention to boost subjective well-being. The idea that, for ex-ample, ‘random acts of kindness’ can boost the well-being not only ofthe recipient, but also the actor, and could thereby provide a simple,eﬀective, inexpensive and widely-available means of addressing socialproblems ranging from social isolation to more serious mental andphysical health conditions, has been taken up and promoted by a largenumber of research groups, charities and government organisations(Aked, Marks, Cordon, & Thompson, 2008; Aked & Thompson, 2011;see S1; Huppert, 2009).Here we outline existing theories of altruism and their relation tokindness, and consider the predictions these theories make about well-being.

And we end with a discussion of the limitations ofthe existing literature, and make recommendations for future research.2. The causes of kindnessKindness refers to actions intended to beneﬁt others. Why and underwhat circumstances are people kind to others? Why do people behave inprosocial, cooperative and altruistic ways? Recent interdisciplinaryresearch has provided a wealth of answers to these questions (Curry,2016).Humans evolved from a long line of social primates, who have beenliving in social groups for over 50million years (Shultz, Opie, &Atkinson, 2011). Group living aﬀords numerous opportunities for var-ious diﬀerent types of mutually beneﬁcial cooperative interaction(Lehmann & Keller, 2006; Nunn & Lewis, 2001; Sachs, Mueller, Wilcox,& Bull, 2004). Natural selection has favoured a range of evolved psy-chological mechanisms for taking advantages of these opportunities,and realising the beneﬁts of cooperation. These mechanisms – kin al-truism, mutualism, reciprocal altruism, and competitive altruism –make it possible to identify and explain several diﬀerent types ofkindness.2.1. Kin Altruism: people will be kind to their familiesNatural selection favours kindness to genetic relatives, to familymembers (Hamilton, 1964). Examples of such ‘kin altruism’ are wide-spread in nature (Gardner & West, 2014), most obviously in cases ofparental care (Royle, Smiseth, & Kölliker, 2012). Humans too possessadaptations for detecting and delivering beneﬁts to kin (Lieberman,Tooby, & Cosmides, 2007; Mateo, 2015), especially to oﬀspring (Geary& Flinn, 2001). Kin altruism can explain kindness in the form of love,care, sympathy and compassion. And the theory predicts that thesetendencies will be elicited by others who exhibit cues of genetic relat-edness, especially vulnerable children (Platek, Burch, Panyavin,Wasserman, & Gallup Jr, 2002).2.2. Mutualism: people will be kind to members of their communitiesNatural selection favours the tendency to coordinate, collaborateand be kind to others with whom the actor shares a common interest –team mates, group members, coalition partners. Such ‘mutualisms’ – forthe purpose of collective defence, or collaborative hunting – arewidespread in nature (Bissonnette et al., 2015; Boinski & Garber, 2000;Boos, Kolbe, Kappeler, & Ellwart, 2011; Harcourt & Waal, 1992), andare an ancient and recurrent feature of human social life (Alvard, 2001;Wrangham, 1999). This process has led, in humans, to a psychologythat forms and maintains groups (clubs, gangs, clans, sects, nations, andso on), and acts to promote their interests (sometimes at the expense ofrival groups) (Balliet, Wu, & De Dreu, 2014). Mutualism can explainkindness in the form of loyalty, solidarity, camaraderie, civic-mind-edness, community spirit, and commitment to a cause ‘greater thanoneself’. The theory predicts that these tendencies will be elicited byother members of the groups with which one identiﬁes (includingstrangers) (Whitehouse & Lanman, 2014).2.3. Reciprocal Altruism: people will be kind to those they might meet againNatural selection favours kindness to those who might return thefavour at a later date (Axelrod, 1984; Trivers, 1971).1 Surprisingly, fewif any examples of such ‘reciprocal altruism’ have been found in non-human species (Amici et al., 2014; Clutton-Brock, 2009). But inhumans, reciprocal altruism is implemented by psychological me-chanisms that: detect those in need of help, initiate cooperation, signalrecognition of favours received, keep track of who has returned thefavour and who has not, make amends for favours not returned, andaccept repentant cheats back into the fold (Cosmides & Tooby, 2005;McCullough, Kurzban, & Tabak, 2013; Trivers, 1971). Thus, reciprocalaltruism can explain kindness in the form of sympathy (for those inneed), trust (initiating cooperation), returning favours, gratitude (forfavours yet to be returned), forgiveness and friendship. Reciprocal al-truism predicts that these tendencies will most likely be elicited in re-peated interactions where individuals expect to meet again, where one'scooperative (or uncooperative) behaviour can be observed by others,and towards others who have helped them in the past, or will be able tohelp them in the future (Kraft-Todd, Yoeli, Bhanot, & Rand, 2015). Thiscan includes kindness to strangers: a kind act may be a way of making anew friend; after all, ‘a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet’(Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2011; Krasnow, Delton, Tooby,& Cosmides, 2013).2.4. Competitive Altruism: people will be kind to others when it enhancestheir statusNatural selection also favours kindness that impresses peers andattracts mates (Gintis, Smith, & Bowles, 2001; Maynard Smith & Price,1973). Many animals resolve status competition by engaging in costlydisplays of prowess (Hardy & Briﬀa, 2013; Riechert, 1998). In humans,and perhaps some other species (Zahavi & Zahavi, 1997), these displaysincludes altruistic acts that beneﬁt the audience (Hardy & Van Vugt,2006; Hawkes, 1991; Hawkes, O'Connell, & Blurton Jones, 2001;Mazur, 2005; Miller, 2000; Smith & Bleige Bird, 2000). This ‘competi-tive altruism’ can explain kindness in the form of generosity, bravery,heroism, chivalry, magnanimity and public service. The theory predictsthat these tendencies will be elicited in the presence of rivals, or po-tential mates, where acting altruistically may enhance one's status(Raihani & Smith, 2015). This includes acts of kindness to strangers:helping a stranger may improve your status whether the recipient is in aposition to return the favour or not (Barclay, 2011; Raihani & Bshary,2015).Thus, multiple theories – kin altruism, mutualism, reciprocal al-truism, competitive altruism – explain multiple types of kindness. Andthe human capacity for culture—the ability to invent and share newways of living (Boyd, Richerson, & Henrich, 2011; Pinker, 2010)—hasallowed us to build and elaborate upon this benevolent biologicalfoundation, with rules, norms and other social institutions that furtherinculcate and amplify cooperation and altruism (Hammerstein, 2003).These theories predict that people will be motivated to be kind to fa-mily, friends, colleagues, spouses, and even strangers under someconditions.2 And the possession of such motivational systems leads us toexpect that helping others might make people happy.3. The consequences of kindnessSubjective well-being – including happiness, life-satisfaction andpositive aﬀect – refers to a range positively valenced psychologicalstates (Dolan & Metcalfe, 2012; OECD, 2013). Why would performingkind acts improve well-being? Why would helping make you happy?Broadly speaking, happiness can be seen as an internal reward systemfor acting in ways that promote survival and reproduction (Buss, 2000).Happiness is: “a psychological reward, an internal signaling device thattells us that an adaptive problem has been, or is in the process of being,1 For further discussion of various subtypes of reciprocity, such as indirect and networkreciprocity, see (Roberts, 2008; Tanimoto, 2015)2 Note that the argument here is that biology and culture have equipped us to helpautomatically, intuitively, innocently – there is no suggestion that people are necessarilyaware of the causes of their benevolent behaviour, or are acting from any ulterior motive.“The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing” (Pascal, 1669).O.S. Curry et al. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx2solved successfully” (Hill, DelPriore, & Major, 2013). From this per-spective, it is no problem to explain why ‘eating’ or ‘having sex’ makespeople happy; these behaviours meet important adaptive goals. And, forthe reasons outlined above, it is equally straightforward to explain whyperforming acts of kindness might make people happy: it is becausecaring for family, maintaining coalitions, trading favours and increasingstatus are also important adaptive goals (Schulkin, 2011). Indeed, wemight even expect helping others to produce more happiness thanhelping yourself: it is precisely because helping others can sometimesgive a better return on investment than helping yourself that evolutionhas favoured kindness in the ﬁrst place.Thus, the evolutionary behavioural science approach to altruismpredicts that people will be happy to help family, friends, communitymembers, spouses, and even strangers under some conditions. Thisprediction has received some support from the existing literature. Alarge body of research has established an association between kindnessand well-being (Anik, Aknin, Norton, & Dunn, 2009; Konrath & Brown,2013). However, much of this research has been correlational —showing, for example, that people who spend more money on others arehappier (Aknin, Barrington-Leigh, et al., 2013), or people who volun-teer to help others are healthier (Jenkinson et al., 2013).3 While suchcorrelational evidence is consistent with the prediction that people willbe happy to help others, it is not suﬃcient to establish a causal re-lationship between kindness and well-being. After all, it's possible thathelping makes you happy; but it could also be that happiness makes youhelpful, or it could be that some third variable – health, income, orpersonality – makes you both happy and helpful. The distinction be-tween correlation and cause is not a mere philosophical nicety; it is agenuine diﬀerence with important practical implications. In the ab-sence of a clear causal connection, kindness interventions may notwork. They may waste time and money, or displace other more eﬀectiveinterventions. Worse, they may be counter-productive. If happinesscauses helping (rather than the other way around), then forcing un-happy people to help may make them less happy still.In order to establish whether performing acts of kindness can causehappiness, it is necessary to focus on the experimental literature. And sowe undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of research that metthe following inclusion criteria: (a) experiments that randomly allocatedparticipants to (b) interventions involving kind behaviour and controls and(c) subsequently measured and compared participant well-being.4. MethodsIn order to identify suitable experimental studies of the eﬀects ofaltruism on the altruist's well-being, we conducted searches of the sci-entiﬁc databases Web of Science and PsychInfo for academic articles.The most recent search was conducted on 16th November 2017. Theprocess is summarised in the ﬂow diagram in Fig. 1. Searching topic,abstracts and keywords, we used the search string: (kindness OR al-truis* OR prosocial OR co-operat* OR cooperat*) AND (wellbeing ORwell-being OR happiness OR life satisfaction OR positive aﬀect ORnegative aﬀect OR PANAS) AND (experiment* OR control OR conditionOR random* OR empirical OR trial) NOT (mindfulness OR meditationOR loving-kindness). This search identiﬁed 712 articles. To this weadded 36 articles identiﬁed by other means (following references inbooks and journal articles, Google scholar searches, viewing academicresearchers' web-pages, reviewers' suggestions, and contacting authorsto request unpublished data). After removing duplicates, we were leftwith 489 articles.This initial set of 489 articles was screened. Two researchers (LARand OSC) read the titles and abstracts. Subsequently 432 articles wereexcluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. These articles were ei-ther: (a) not experimental (for example, were qualitative or correla-tional studies, or review papers); (b) did not involve kind behaviour (forexample, they involved hypothetical or recalled kindness); (c) did notmeasure participant well-being (for example, they measured sub-sequent kindness, or the happiness of the recipient); or were otherwiseoﬀ topic (for example, kindness in animal husbandry, climate changeand planetary wellbeing). Cases in which the researchers disagreedwere given greater scrutiny and discussed, and where no consensus wasreached, the articles were included in the next stage of the analysis.The remaining 57 articles were then read in full, and assessed forappropriateness for the meta-analysis (see S2 for the full list). Thisprocess excluded a further 33 records (and several studies from in-cluded articles) for reasons summarised in Table S1.4 At the end of thisprocess we were left with 24 articles, containing a total of relevant 27studies that had experimentally tested the hypothesis that kindnesscauses well-being.For each of these studies we coded the following characteristics:• mean age of sample• sex of participants• location of study• type of participant (for example, whether participants were ‘typi-cally developed individuals’, as opposed to having been diagnosedwith some psychopathology)• type of intervention (for example, ‘random act of kindness’, proso-cial purchase, charitable donation)• type of recipient (for example, whether family, friend, stranger)• type of control condition(s) (for example, no treatment, self-kind-ness, other activity)• dependent measure(s) (for example, happiness, life-satisfaction)• size of the intervention group(s)• size of the control group(s)• eﬀect size(s) (Cohen's d)Eﬀect sizes were either taken directly from the paper, or computedfrom reported inferential or descriptive statistics (Lenhard & Lenhard,2016). For the handful of studies that reported outcomes at multipletime-points, we coded the eﬀect closest in time to the intervention.5. Results5.1. Study characteristicsThe characteristics of the 27 studies are presented in Table 1. These27 studies included a total of 4045 participants (mean proportionmale= 35%, mean age=25.04, SD=11.05).5The majority of participants came from Canada, USA and Europe,although there were also studies conducted in South Africa, Korea andVanuatu. Most participants were university students, although therewere also two studies with children, one study of Vanuatu villagers, andone with elderly participants. Most were ‘typically developed in-dividuals’, although two studies involved participants who scored3 Even then the eﬀects are modest. This meta-analysis of the relationship betweenvolunteering and health in the elderly found that volunteers were 22% less likely thatnon-volunteers to die during the follow-up period of the studies (Jenkinson et al., 2013).However, the import of this ﬁnding depends on the base-rate. By way of illustration, if onaverage 10 out of 1000 (1%) non-volunteers die during the follow-up period, then a 22%percent decrease means that 7.8 out of 1000 (0.78%) volunteers would die during thesame period. Moreover, as this review goes on to say: “These ﬁndings were not conﬁrmedby experimental studies.”4 The most highly cited paper in the kindness literature (with 597 citations at the timeof the last search) purports to provide evidence that kind acts boosts the well-being of theactor (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, & Schkade, 2005). However, the article does not report thesize of the sample, the dependent measure, or any inferential statistics (for example, eﬀectsize or signiﬁcance). Email correspondence with the author revealed that the data are nolonger available.5 These averages are approximate (~), because the age and sex ratio of the sampleswere not available for some studies.O.S. Curry et al. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx3highly on measures of social anxiety.The two most common interventions were ‘acts of kindness’ and‘prosocial purchasing’. Typical instructions for the ‘acts of kindness’intervention were as follows:“During the coming week, please perform at least ﬁve acts ofkindness per day and report on them in the evening, including theresponses of others that you received. Examples of acts of kindnessare: holding a door for someone at university, greeting strangers inthe hallway, helping other students in preparing for an exam, et-cetera. It does not matter whether you address your acts of kindnessto people you know or not”.(Ouweneel, Le Blanc, & Schaufeli, 2014)Prosocial purchasing interventions involved giving participants asum of money, and instructing them to spend it on someone else. Most‘acts of kindness’ involved a cost; but, the ‘prosocial spending’ studiesthat involved a windfall payment to the participant did not.The recipients of kindness included colleagues and charities, butwere for the most part left unspeciﬁed, and could be ‘anyone’ – familiaror unfamiliar, family, friend, community member of stranger.Control conditions also varied. Some studies compared acting kindlywith doing nothing (thus possibly confounding the eﬀects of kindnesswith the eﬀects of performing any novel fun activity), whereas otherscompared acting kindly with some other non-social activity, or withhelping oneself.Most studies used a self-report measure of subjective well-being,happiness, life-satisfaction, or positive and negative aﬀect. These in-cluded the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS; Lyubomirsky & Lepper,1999), the Steen Happiness Index (SHI; Seligman, Steen, Park, &Peterson, 2005), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener,Emmons, Larsen, & Griﬃn, 1985), the Positive Aﬀect and NegativeAﬀect Scale (PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and Psycholo-gical Flourishing (Lamers, Westerhof, Bohlmeijer, ten Klooster, &Keyes, 2011). Three studies used more objective measures: two usedother-rated smiling, and one used ‘other rated happiness’.Some studies had multiple control conditions, and/or multipleoutcome measures, and hence provided more than one eﬀect size; therewere 52 in total.5.2. Descriptive statisticsThe eﬀect size estimates ranged from −0.46 to 1.25 (M=0.25,SD=0.32). Sample sizes ranged from 26 to 474 participants(M=158.57, SD=132.05). Several studies reported multiple eﬀectsizes (1–6, with most reporting one or two eﬀect sizes).5.3.

Curry et al. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx52017), following the recommendations summarised in (Field & Gillett,2010). We used three-level meta-analysis to account for dependent ef-fect sizes within studies (Van den Noortgate, López-López, Marín-Martínez, & Sánchez-Meca, 2015). Let yjk denote the j observed eﬀectsizes y, originating from k studies. The multi-level model is then givenby the following equations:= + ∼= + ∼= + ∼⎫⎬⎪⎭⎪( )y β N σβ θ w w N σθ δ b b N σϵ whereϵ 0,where (0, )where (0, )jk jk jk jkjk k jk jk wk k k bϵ222jkThe ﬁrst equation indicates that observed eﬀect sizes are equal tothe underlying population eﬀect size, plus sampling error ϵjk. Thesecond equation indicates that population eﬀect sizes within studies area function of a study-speciﬁc true eﬀect size, plus within-study residualswjk. The third equation indicates that the distribution of study-speciﬁctrue eﬀect sizes are distributed around an overall mean eﬀect, withbetween-study residuals bk. Results revealed that the overall eﬀect sizeestimate was δ=0.28, 95% CI [0.16, 0.41], Z=4.36, p < .001 (seeFig. 2). This is a small-to-medium eﬀect, approximately equivalent to anincrease of 0.6 on a standard 0–10 happiness scale (Helliwell, Layard, &Sachs, 2016). The within-studies variance component σw2 was negli-gible, 0.00, 95% CI [< 0.01, 0.02]. The between-studies variance σb2,on the other hand, diﬀered signiﬁcantly from zero, 0.08, 95% CI [0.04,0.18]. The fact that the between-studies component was larger than thewithin-studies component indicates that the variation in eﬀect sizes wasprimarily accounted for by diﬀerences between studies, whereas dif-ferences between eﬀect sizes within the same studies were negligible.Likelihood ratio tests also indicated that constraining the within-studiesvariance to zero would not worsen model ﬁt, whereas constraining ei-ther the between-studies variance or both variance components to zerodid lead to signiﬁcant deteriorations in model ﬁt (see Table 2). Thisagain indicates that there was substantial heterogeneity betweenaverage eﬀect sizes across studies, but not between eﬀect sizes pub-lished within the same studies.File drawer analysis (Rosenthal, 1979) revealed that 1919 un-published, ﬁled, or unretrieved studies averaging null results would berequired to bring the average unweighted eﬀect size to nonsigniﬁcance.Visual inspection of the Funnel plot (Fig. 3) did not clearly indicateasymmetry, which could be a sign of publication bias. Begg's test offunnel asymmetry (based on random-eﬀects meta-analysis) similarlydid not indicate signiﬁcant bias, Z=1.07, p=0.28.5.4. ModerationWe coded several potential theoretical and methodological moderators:proportion of male participants, average age of the sample, type of parti-cipant (typical, socially anxious), type of intervention (acts of kindness,prosocial spending, other), type of control condition (nothing, neutral ac-tivity, self-help, other), and outcome measure (happiness, life satisfaction,positive or negative aﬀect or emotion, other).The small sample size limits our ability to include these moderators inmixed-eﬀects meta-analysis without risking overﬁtting (modeling randomnoise in the data, rather than true moderating eﬀects). We therefore usedmetaforest (Van Lissa, 2017) to screen for relevant moderators. This tech-nique uses the machine learning algorithm “random forests” to preventoverﬁtting, and to assess the importance of several potential moderators. Anadded beneﬁt is that metaforest can capture non-linear relationships be-tween moderators and eﬀect size, and higher-order interactions. To thisend, many (in this case, 10,000) bootstrap samples are drawn from theoriginal data, and a models is estimated on each bootstrap sample. Then,each model's performance is evaluated on cases not part of its bootstrapsample, yielding an estimate of explained variance in new data, Roob2.

Journal of Experimental Social Psychology xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx7mtry=2). We replicated the analysis 100 times to ensure the reliability ofﬁndings. The median estimated explained variance in out-of-bootstrap caseswas negative (Roob2=−0.11), with a large standard deviation across re-plications (SD=0.19). When Roob2 is negative, this means that the averageeﬀect size is a better predictor of out-of-bootstrap cases than the model-implied predictions. In other words, the model did not capture general-izable relationships between the moderators and eﬀect size, and we did notﬁnd evidence for associations between the moderators and eﬀect size.6. DiscussionThe results of this systematic review and meta-analysis of the experi-mental kindness literature suggests that performing acts of kindness im-proves the well-being of the actor (δ=0.28). The eﬀect of kindness issmall-to-medium – comparable to other positive psychology interventions(such as ‘mindfulness’, ‘positive thinking’ and ‘counting your blessings’;d=0.34, Bolier et al., 2013; d=0.31, Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009;d=0.44, Weiss, Westerhof, & Bohlmeijer, 2016).6 The eﬀect was notmoderated by sex, age, type of participant, intervention, control conditionor outcome measure. And there was no evidence of publication bias. To-gether, these results suggest that policy-makers and practitioners are cor-rect to see kindness interventions as eﬀective ways of improving well-being. And they support the general claim that, as social animals, humanspossess a range of psychological mechanisms that motivate them to helpothers, and that they derive satisfaction from doing so.However, in interpreting these results, a number of limitationsshould be kept in mind.First, most of the reviewed studies were under-powered. The averagesample size per condition was N=79; this gives power of only 1-β=0.42to detect a typical eﬀect size of d=0.28. In order to detect such an eﬀectwith power 1-β=0.80, future researchers should use a sample size of atleast 202 per group (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007).Second, most of the reviewed studies used non-clinical samples ofstudents, from Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democraticsocieties (W.E.I.R.D.; Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010). Thus itremains unclear whether the current ﬁndings would generalise toclinical samples of participants diagnosed with speciﬁc mental healthproblems, in non-WEIRD societies. Future research should employ morerepresentative community samples (perhaps focussing on social dis-orders; Qualter et al., 2015), in a wider variety of cultures.Third, earlier we deﬁned kindness as ‘actions intended to beneﬁtothers’. The studies reviewed here varied whether actions beneﬁttingothers were performed, they did not vary whether the beneﬁts wereintended or not – in other words, they did not manipulate the motivebehind the action. Previous research has found an association betweenmotive and outcome; one longitudinal study found that volunteersmotivated by a desire to help others lived longer than non-volunteers,but that volunteers motivated by a desire to help themselves did not(Konrath, Fuhrel-Forbis, Lou, & Brown, 2012). If this relationship iscausal, then policy-makers should be aware that encouraging people tohelp others because of the beneﬁts to themselves may be counter-pro-ductive – it may, somewhat paradoxically, mitigate or eliminate theeﬀect. Further experimental research will be needed to investigate therole of intention on the beneﬁts of helping others.Fourth, although the ﬁnding is consistent with the general evolu-tionary account of altruism outlined above, existing research has nottested the more ﬁne-grained predictions that arise from the more spe-ciﬁc theories of helping (kin altruism, mutualism, reciprocal altruismand competitive altruism). For example, there has been little systematicinvestigation of whether diﬀerent people beneﬁt more from performingacts of kindness under diﬀerent conditions. And studies have not sys-tematically varied the type of recipient, for example family, colleague,friend, stranger. In fact, in most cases the recipient was left unspeciﬁed– that is, they could be ‘anyone’. And so we do not know whether:people who have lost touch with their families derive more pleasurefrom acts of kin altruism; or whether people are happier giving tochildren as opposed to adults. We do not know whether, as mutualismpredicts, people are be happier giving to in-group as opposed to out-groups; or whether, as reciprocal altruism predicts, people are happiergiving to unlucky, as opposed to lazy, recipients (Petersen, 2012). Nordo we know whether ambitious people (with more resources to spare)seeking status are happier engaging in acts of competitive altruism,whether single people who are courting are happier helping help po-tential mates, or whether there are any sex diﬀerences in the satisfac-tion derived from diﬀerent kinds of helping (Balliet, Li, Macfarlan, &Van Vugt, 2011). Thus future work should seek to ﬁll these gaps in ourunderstanding. There is already a large literature on whether peoplebehave more or less altruistically to speciﬁc types of people; it would befairly straightforward to add measures of subjective well-being to re-plications and extensions of these designs.Fifth and ﬁnally, existing research has tended to look at the im-mediate eﬀects of kindness well-being. Hence it is not clear what thelonger-term eﬀects of the intervention, on well-being or more distalmeasures, may be. After all, previous research suggests that such eﬀectsare likely to be short-lived – ‘happiness’ provides an immediate rewardfor behaviour that has long-term beneﬁts, and research on the ‘hedonictreadmill’ suggests that people might have a ‘set point’ that they returnto whatever happens to them, good or bad (Ryan & Deci, 2001). If thefunction of altruistic behaviour is to help families, make new friends,improve communities, increase status, or ﬁnd a mate, then it would beinstructive for future experiments to measure these hypothesised long-term beneﬁts. Do people allocated to the kindness condition reportbetter relations with their families? More identiﬁcation with theircommunities? More friends? More recognition and honours? Morepride in one's achievements (Sznycer et al., 2017)? More sexual part-ners (Arnocky, Piché, Albert, Ouellette, & Barclay, 2016)? More com-mitted relationships (Kogan et al., 2010)? More resilient marriages? Ifso, then future research might be able to ﬁnally connect the two typesof happiness – short-term hedonic pleasure, and long-term eudaemoniccomponents of the good life – that have hitherto remained apart.Table 2Model ﬁt indices.df AIC BIC II LRT pThree-level model 3 22.14 28.16 −8.07Within-studies variance constrained 2 20.14 24.15 −8.07 0 1Between-studies variance constrained 2 33 36.76 −14.37 12.61 0Both variance components constrained 1 78 80.25 −38.12 60.1 0Note.

ConclusionHelping others makes you happy, but the eﬀect is relatively modest.Further empirical work testing the implications of more speciﬁc the-ories of social, cooperative and altruistic behaviour is needed to de-termine whether the eﬀect might be larger for some types of helpers,when helping some types of recipients. This research will advance ourunderstanding of the causes and consequences of kindness, and helppractitioners to maximise the eﬀectiveness of kindness interventions.Open practicesThe data and analysis script for this study are available on its OpenScience Framework page (https://osf.io/sey6x/).Appendix A.
