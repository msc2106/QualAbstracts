ABSTRACT: 
OBJECTIVE: We investigate the association between adult asthma and wealth, testing whether the disease impairs wealth accumulation (social selection model) or if wealth protects against asthma (social causation model). METHODS: We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (n = 7,644) and linear and logistic regressions to estimate the association between wealth and asthma. Changes in relative wealth following an asthma diagnosis and asthma status by increases in wealth through inheritance provide evidence on the causal direction. RESULTS: Asthma, particularly severe asthma, is associated with lower wealth. Wealth ranking does not change after a diagnosis of asthma, but inheriting a substantial sum is associated with a lower risk of severe asthma. CONCLUSION: Wealth appears to protect against severe asthma, supporting the social causation model of disease.Accepted manuscrip. 
 
PREDICTION: 
This paper examines the relationship between adult asthma and wealth using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (PLSY79) to examine the relationship between adult asthma and wealth. We test three hypotheses: (1) asthma and wealth are inversely related; (2) asthma reduces wealth (social selection); and (3) wealth reduces asthma (social causation). Regression results show that asthma and wealth are inversely related. Additionally tests find no evidence that the onset of asthma is associated with a change in wealth ranking, but an increase in wealth through inheritance is associated with a lower risk of severe asthma. These results support the social causation hypothesis that socioeconomic status protects health.

Understanding the consequences of asthma is becoming increasingly important because its prevalence has been steadily rising in the U.S. Between 1997 and 2012 the percent of men and women reporting that they had ever had asthma rose by 36% and 43% respectively (CDC n.d.). In 2012 nearly 11 percent of men and 14 percent of women reported ever receiving a diagnosis of asthma (CDC 2012a). Rudd and Moorman (2007), using different data, find the upward trend in asthma prevalence has been occurring since at least 1980. The American Lung Association (2012) estimates that asthma costs roughly $50.1 billion in direct medical expenditures and $5.9 billion in indirect costs (reduced labor productivity), for a total of $56 billion annually. Corso and Fertig (2009) estimate that children born in 2000 who develop asthma will generate $3.2 billion in medical costs and $4 billion in lost labor productivity over the course of their lives. The substantial costs associated with asthma prompt policymakers’ interest in its prevention and treatment. This paper is the first to use nationally representative longitudinal data for the U.S. to investigate the association between adult asthma and wealth. We test three hypotheses: (1) asthma and wealth are inversely related; (2) asthma reduces wealth (social selection); and (3) wealth reduces asthma (social causation). Regression results show that asthma and wealth are inversely related. Additional tests find no evidence that the onset of asthma is associated with a change in wealth ranking, but an increase in wealth through inheritance is associated with a lower risk of severe asthma. These results support the social causation hypothesis that socioeconomic status (SES) protects health. 2 Background Two strands of literature lay the groundwork for this study: the health-wealth relationship in general and the asthma-wealth relationship in particular. While the evidence is clear that health and wealth are related, how they are related remains murky (Duncan et al. 2002; Pollack et al. 2007). The social causation model theorizes that SES causes health, predicting that wealth enables individuals to acquire the resources needed to produce and maintain health (Link and Phelan 1995; Wheaton 1978). The social selection model posits the reverse causal pattern, health causes SES (Eaton 1980; West 1991), implying poor health impairs the ability to accumulate wealth. Adler and Stewart (2010) review the literature on SES and health and note that causality appears to flow one way and then another, depending on the sample and age group studied. Mulatu and Schooler (2002) report evidence of mutual causation in a sample of employed men. Goldman (2006) reviews longitudinal studies and concludes that the social causation model garners more support than does the social selection model. Because health in general is related to SES, it’s reasonable to suspect that is related to wealth. The social selection approach to asthma notes that like any chronic health problem in adulthood, asthma can reduce the ability to earn income and requires out-of-pocket medical expenditures, which may divert money from savings and investment. Unlike other chronic diseases, however, asthma is common among working-age adults and thus may have a larger impact on labor market participation than illnesses more likely to strike later in life (Blanc 2000). The evidence that asthma adversely affects labor market participation is compelling. While asthma ranks relatively low as a source of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and number of 3 deaths, it ranks in the top ten sources of Years Lost to Disability (YLD) (McKenna et al. 2005). Not surprisingly, more severe asthma is associated with a greater risk of work disability (Balder et al. 1998). Druss et al. (2002) report that asthma ranks seventh among top causes of work-loss days. Estimates of work days lost due to asthma range from 2.1 million (Smith et al. 1997) to 3 million (Weiss et al. 1992). Asthma may reduce productivity not only by reducing work days, but also by raising the risk of unemployment. Studies of asthma’s association with unemployment find effects that range from small (Sibbald et al. 1992; Wilson 2001) to moderate (Ameille et al. 1997; Blanc et al. 2001). Given the negative impact of asthma on working, it’s not surprising that the disease is associated with lower earnings. Two studies report that the onset of occupational asthma is associated with income declines of 35% to 50% (Ameille et al. 1997; Gannon et al. 1993). These adverse labor market outcomes among asthmatics support the social selection model. Asthma may reduce lifetime earnings by hastening retirement. In a sample of respondents aged 55 to 75, asthma was associated with an increased risk of early retirement (Yelin et al. 2006). However, Miah and Wilcox-Gök (2007) report that among workers ages 51 to 61, chronic illnesses, such as asthma, are associated with delayed retirement because it reduces wealth – workers can’t afford to retire. Absenteeism, disability, unemployment and possibly early retirement all reduce lifetime earnings and thus the ability to accumulate wealth. While the literature suggests asthma’s adverse impact on earnings is substantial, the available evidence suggests that the treatment costs to individual asthmatics are modest. The 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MPES) shows that among individuals who received asthma treatment, the per capita cost averaged $663, of which about $252 was paid out-of-pocket 4 (Druss et al. 2001). These results suggest asthma treatment expenses do not divert large amounts of money away from savings and investment. In contrast to the social selection model, the social causation model posits that causality flows from SES to asthma (Chen and Schreier 2009). More is known about the factors that increase asthma’s morbidity than its causes (Gold and Wright 2005). Notably, asthma symptoms are worsened by environmental factors (Global Initiative on Asthma 2009; Institute of Medicine 2000). Wealthier people can use their financial resources to live in neighborhoods with fewer environmental risk factors, stressors, and can more frequently replace items in their homes which contribute to asthma symptoms. Moreover, wealthier people can buy better quality medical care, enabling them to dampen the impact of the asthma. The social causation model also garners empirical support, although no studies examine asthma specifically. Jackson et al. (2004) find a gradient in children’s respiratory health, measured as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), using parents’ educational level to measure SES. Two studies produce evidence that adult pulmonary disease is associated with childhood SES (Prescott and Vestbo 1999; Ramsay et al. 2011). Three studies present evidence that characteristics of the physical environment in which the poor can afford to live trigger asthma (Katz et al. 2001; Neidell 2004; Rosenbaum 2008). In sum, the literature on the SES-respiratory health relationship supports the hypothesis that greater SES protects against asthma. Data and Methods This analysis uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to track asthma prevalence and wealth among adult Americans born between 1957 and 1964 (baby boomers). 5 The NLSY79 is a stratified, multistage area sample covering the entire U.S (Zagorsky 1997). It has tracked the lives of 12,686 people since 1979; however because of attrition and funding cutbacks this study examines only 7,644 individuals. We use the survey weights to correct for the over-sampling of poor individuals, Blacks, and Hispanics and for the complex sample design. Asthma Status In 2004 the NLSY79 included a one-time asthma module. Asthma information was gathered for 852 respondents (out of 7,650) who affirmatively answered the question: “Has a doctor, nurse or other health professional ever told you that you have asthma?” Respondents answering “yes” were then asked their age when first diagnosed with asthma, whether they currently have asthma, and the age they last experienced asthma symptoms. Finally, respondents were asked whether they had any asthma symptoms in the past 30 days, any emergency trips to the doctor to treat asthma in the past 12 months, and whether they used medication to prevent asthma attacks. Six key disease indicators were created from the asthma module. First, “Ever Had Asthma” captures whether a respondent reported they had ever been diagnosed with asthma. Second, “Currently Has Asthma” tracks only respondents who reported they had the condition at the time of the survey. Third, “Previously Had Asthma” accounts for respondents who had been diagnosed with asthma, but did not report suffering from the condition at the time of the interview (in remission). The fourth indicator, “Current Severe Asthma,” is defined as individuals with current asthma who reported at least one of the following: During the past 12 months they made an unscheduled trip to an emergency room, doctor, or urgent care center because of asthma; during the past 12 months asthma limited their usual activities a fair amount to a lot; asthma made it difficult to stay asleep at night at least once a week over the past 30 days. 6 Respondents were also categorized as having severe asthma if they reported experiencing symptoms multiple times weekly. Numerous variations in the definition of “Severe Asthma” were explored, but they did not impact the results because most people with severe asthma reported multiple events. Fifth, “No Asthma” means the respondent reported they had never been diagnosed with the disease. The final disease indicator variable is “Years of Asthma.” Respondents were asked their age when asthma was first diagnosed. For those respondents who stated they no longer suffered from asthma, the age or date when the condition stopped was recorded. For respondents who reported current asthma, age on the survey date was recorded. Subtracting these time values provides a measure of the number of years a respondent has had asthma. Unfortunately, the NLSY79 does not contain any information on whether respondents have a family of history of asthma, which can affect asthma risk (Gorman and Asaithambi 2008). NLSY79 asthma questions have exceptionally high response rates, no respondents declined to answer. In the asthma module six individuals reported that they did not know whether they had asthma and they were dropped from the analysis, leaving 7,644 observations. Wealth NLSY79 wealth questions began in 1985 when the youngest respondents were nearly 21 years old. Respondents are first asked if they or their spouse currently owe a debt or have an asset. If they answer “yes,” the interviewer asked them to state the current market value of each debt or asset. Summing all the asset answers for each respondent and then subtracting the total debts creates the wealth measure for each survey (Zagorsky 1999). Because the top 1% of 7 wealth values on the publicly available NLSY79 dataset is top-coded to ensure privacy we exclude those 150 cases to prevent any distortions. This analysis uses wealth measured in 2004. Results This section describes the data and then tests the three hypotheses: (1) asthma and wealth are inversely related; (2) asthma reduces wealth; and (3) wealth reduces asthma. About eleven percent of respondents reported having been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives, with males reporting lower rates than females, 8 % vs. 12.8% (Table 1). This gender difference is consistent with asthma prevalence patterns reported in the National Health Interview Survey (CDC 2012a) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (CDC 2012b). About half (3.6/7.6) of those who currently have asthma have a severe case, with men reporting lower rates of severe asthma than women, 2.2% vs. 5.0%. (Table 1 about here) Table 2 reports the demographic characteristics of the sample based on asthma status. The top section shows that Whites are somewhat under-represented among asthmatics, while Blacks and Hispanics are over-represented. Women are also over-represented among asthmatics, especially those with severe asthma. If asthma impairs wealth accumulation, then greater asthma prevalence among women and minorities could help account for some of the observed wealth gaps between genders and ethnicities (Conley 2004; Wolff 2010). (Table 2 about here) The table’s middle section reports factors that are at least partially under the respondent’s control. Income is negatively associated with asthma and the more severe or current the 8 condition, the lower is income. For example, the average income of those who have never had asthma was $77,937 in 2004 compared to $52,371 for those with current, severe asthma. While asthma status does not appear to be related to education measures, there are statistically significant differences by marital status. Respondents who have ever had asthma are less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced than those who have never had asthma. Furthermore, the percent married is lowest and the percent divorced is the highest among those with severe asthma. Because marriage is associated with greater wealth (Schmidt and Sevak 2006; Wilmoth and Koso 2002), lower marriage rates and greater divorce prevalence among asthmatics could contribute to lower wealth. The next two demographic variables track work experience. The difference in self-employment between those who have never had asthma and those who have ever had asthma is not statistically significant. However, asthmatics report working nearly two years less than people who have never had the disease (18 vs. 19.9). This result is consistent with earlier studies of asthma and labor market outcomes reviewed earlier. We next consider two geographic variables: “live in urban area” and “live in Southern state.” Some studies find that living in an urban area is associated with greater asthma prevalence, which is thought to result from poorer air quality (Peel et al. 2005; Wilmoth and Koso 2002) and greater exposure to other triggers such as cockroaches and crime (Aligne et al. 2000; Byrd and Joad 2006). Table 2 shows that the share of respondents living in an urban area does not vary significantly across asthma status. Also, while average wealth is lower in the South, there is no statistically significant association between living in the South and asthma. 9 Finally, because tobacco smoke is an asthma trigger (Global Initiative on Asthma 2009), the bottom of the table shows the percentage of respondents that ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes. This information was gathered in five different NLSY79 surveys. If a respondent stated that they had smoked 100 or more cigarettes in one of these five surveys they were classified as a smoker. The difference between smoking rates among those who have never had asthma and those who have ever had asthma (57.8% vs. 62.2%) is statistically significant. The difference in smoking between asthmatics and non-asthmatics could contribute to differences in wealth because smoking is associated with lower wealth (Zagorsky 2004). However, the difference in the prevalence of living with a smoker between respondents who have ever had asthma and those who have never had the condition is not statistically significant. Having described the sample, we now turn to the first hypothesis: asthma and wealth are inversely related. Table 3 shows the wealth held by NLSY79 respondents in 2004 overall and disaggregated by asthma status. Adults who have never had asthma accumulated a median net worth of $102,854, which is roughly double the median net worth of those who currently have asthma ($52,384) and triple the median net worth of those with severe asthma ($30,506). Across gender, race, and ethnicity those who don’t currently have asthma are wealthier than those who currently have asthma, who in turn are wealthier than those with severe asthma. These results support the hypothesis that asthma and wealth are inversely related. (Table 3 about here) Table 4 presents estimates of the association between asthma and wealth in 2004 controlling for the demographic variables described above. The omitted category is “No asthma.” The only asthma status which is statistically significantly related to wealth is severe 10 asthma. Having severe asthma is associated with a drop in wealth of over $24,000, which is statistically significant at the 2% level. Thus, hypothesis 1 receives qualified support; asthma and wealth appear to be inversely related when the disease is severe. We also ran the regressions using the natural log of wealth to adjust for the skewness in the wealth distribution (not shown), which produced stronger evidence of an inverse association between asthma and wealth. (Table 4 about here) The lower wealth associated with severe asthma is likely not related to the amount of time a respondent has had the condition as the coefficient on the years of asthma term is not statistically significant. Adding the years of asthma variable to the other regressions (not shown) also results in small and statistically insignificant coefficients. This suggests either the length of time a person has asthma is not associated with wealth or people do not accurately recall when their asthma was first diagnosed. The linear regressions presume that wealth depends on asthma. Reversing these roles shows the association between wealth and the risk of asthma. Table 5 reports the logistic estimated wealth coefficients for the four asthma groups, controlling for the demographic variables included in the previous regressions. Wealth is inversely related to the risk of asthma in all the regressions, but is statistically significant only in the case of severe asthma. This offers additional qualified support for hypothesis 1: asthma and wealth are inversely related when the asthma is severe. (Table 5 about here) 11 In order to better understand what the estimated logistic coefficients mean in terms of an individual, we follow the three step process outlined by Pindyck and Rubinfeld (1998) to present an example. A 45-year-old white, divorced woman with $40,000 income, no net worth, who graduated high school, has three siblings, worked for 15 years and lives in an urban area, has a 7.5% chance of having severe asthma based on the coefficients in the logistic regression. However, increasing her wealth from zero to $50,000, holding the other regressors constant, lowers the chance she has severe asthma to 5.2%, almost a one-third reduction in risk. Raising her wealth to the median (just over $100,000) drops her probability of having severe asthma to 3.5%, a risk reduction of over one-half. These calculations suggest that substantial increases in wealth may be required to reduce the risk of severe asthma. The results thus far support both possible causal directions. While respondents cannot be assigned to treatment and control groups, the longitudinal nature of the NSLY79 provides some evidence on the likely direction of the causal flow. Respondents have provided wealth information at numerous points in their lives, so individuals who reported first having asthma when they were in their twenties or older have wealth information before and after they became asthmatic. If becoming asthmatic adversely impacts wealth per the social selection model, these respondents would experience a wealth decline after the onset of asthma (hypothesis 2). To account for fluctuations in the U.S. economy over the observation period, table 6 tracks the typical change in each respondent’s ranking in the wealth distribution instead of their absolute wealth. A respondent’s ranking ranges from zero to 100 percent, where the percentage represents the fraction of people poorer than the respondent. For example, a value of 33% in 1988 and 25% in 1990 means the respondent was wealthier than one-third of the cohort in 1988, but by 1990 was wealthier than just one-quarter, i.e. the respondent’s relative wealth dropped. 12 (Table 6 about here) The top row shows that one year prior to asthma diagnosis the typical respondent ranked 41% in the wealth distribution. The second row shows that, using time windows ranging from 1 to 5 years after diagnosis, the median asthmatic’s ranking was still about 41%. This suggests that relative wealth does not decline after an asthma diagnosis, failing to support hypothesis 2 (social selection). Finally, we test hypothesis 3: wealth protects against asthma (social causation). We searched the NLSY79 for situations where an individual’s wealth exogenously changes. If wealth protects against asthma, then people who receive increases in wealth would exhibit lower asthma prevalence and/or severity. The NLSY79 includes information on the receipt of inheritances and large gifts, which constitute an increase in wealth; however inheritances may not be entirely exogenous. Table 7 shows the number of respondents who reported whether their asthma was currently severe or not by inheritance status. Among those not getting a large inheritance, roughly half have severe asthma. In contrast, among those who inherited a large amount of money, only one-third has severe asthma. Moreover, the percentage with severe asthma drops as the size of the inheritance increases. These findings suggest that increases in wealth reduce the prevalence of severe asthma, supporting the social causation model. (Table 7 about here) Conclusion 13 This research investigated the relationship between adult asthma and wealth using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), a nationally representative sample of baby boomers in the U.S. Regressions controlling for an array of socioeconomic and demographic factors show that respondents who currently have asthma have a net worth that is lower by about $16,000 and that individuals who currently have severe asthma have a net worth that is approximately $24,500 lower than those who have never had asthma. Additional tests indicate that wealth protects against severe asthma (social causation), but do not support the hypothesis that asthma impairs wealth accumulation (social selection). Overall, this analysis suggests wealth is more of a cause than a consequence of asthma. Three caveats must be noted. First, the findings apply to a particular cohort of U.S. adults, individuals in other countries and in other age ranges may have a different asthma-wealth relationship. Second, while the results suggest a causal relationship running from wealth to asthma, causality cannot be proven given that it is impossible to run a controlled experiment that randomly assigns individuals to particular asthma and wealth categories. Finally, while the regressions control for many important factors, it is possible that wealth and asthma are both related to a missing common set of factors that actually drive the relationship. Despite this caveats, the results have an interesting policy implication: increases in wealth may reduce the risk of severe asthma. This suggests that programs to encourage saving and prudent investment could improve respiratory health, reducing the public and private costs of asthma. 14 REFERENCES Adler, N. and J.
