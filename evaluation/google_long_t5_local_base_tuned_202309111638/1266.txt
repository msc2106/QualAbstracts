ABSTRACT: 
We investigated the pleasurability of aggressive behavioral decisions. Four questionnaires (on hedonicity, decisión making, justification of aggression, and impulsiveness) were given to 50 participants of both sexes, ranging from 16 to 80 years old. Most participants avoided unpleasant behaviors as part of a trend to maximize pleasure and to minimize displeasure. Mean hedonicity ratings followed a bell curve with increasing levels of aggressiveness (p < .0001). Thus, the participants chose neither passive nor highly aggressive responses to social conflicts, with both extremes receiving the most unpleasant ratings. The results offer empirical support for an interesting point: People may derive pleasure from aggression as long as it is exhibited on a low to medium level. More precisely, people associate pleasure with aggression up to a certain point: Aggressive responses of medium intensity were rated significantly less unpleasant than the most passive and most aggressive ones, which were associated with less pleasure. Conclusion: In social conflicts, behavior tends to maximize experienced pleasure; and impulsive aggression produces pleasure in the aggressor, except at extreme intensities. The point that mild to moderate aggression brings pleasure, whereas extreme or severe aggression does not, provides a perspective that may reconcile conflicting observations in the literature. 
 
PREDICTION: 
This study focuses on hedonicity and aggression to ex-plore a neglected aspect of aggression theory and research: the pleasure that people might derive from acting or responding aggressively. Pleasure maximization appears to be a prerational decision-making mechanism that serves to optimize their pleasure. This conclusion was reached from results obtained by Cabanac’s laboratory with sensory pleasure as well as pleapively implying that hedonicity strongly affects decision making. The results show that impulsive behavior is a significant factor in a variety of impulsive behaviors, but not extreme or severe aggression. This relationship is nei-ther obvious nor inevitable, but but obvious nor inevitable, as shown by the fact that only one participant chose the most pleasurable pleasure, they were systematically avoided the most pleasurable behaviors. The results show that pleasure does correlate with cognitive impulsiveness and aggressive behavior in response to severe social stress, but not extreme or severe aggression. Such a correlation between pleasure and behavioral choice may appear obvious. Yet this relationship is nei-ther obvious nor inevitable, but but obvious nor inevitable, as shown by the fact that only one participant chose the most pleasurable behavior, that two participants systematically avoided the most pleasurable behaviors and, finally, that two participants repeated chose the most unpleasant behaviors. 
 
FULL TEXT: 
  Keywords: aggressiveness, impulsiveness, decision making, pleasure, age. This study focuses on hedonicity and aggression to ex- plore a neglected aspect of aggression theory and re- search: the pleasure that people might derive from acting or responding aggressively. Pleasure maximization appears to be a prerational de- cision-making mechanism that serves to optimize behav- ior. This conclusion was reached from results obtained by Cabanac’s lab with sensory pleasure as well as plea- sure aroused by purely mental work, such as playing a video game or solving grammatical or mathematical problems (Cabanac, 1971; Cabanac et al., 1997; Balaskó & Cabanac, 1998; Cabanac et al., 2002). To explore the hypothesis that hedonicity strongly affects decision mak- ing in social situations, pleasure was analyzed in relation to interpersonal aggression. Aggression encompasses a wide variety of meanings, including different categories with different functions and antecedents (see among others Ramírez 1996, 1998). For instance, Mandel (1959), after observing 9–16-year- old boys at a boarding school, listed 2205 specific ag- gressive behavior types. Whether or not aggression is a deliberate attempt to injure someone, there seems to be a common dichotomy, in terms of purpose or goal, in- ferred or otherwise, between (1) instrumental aggres- sion, which is anger-free and chiefly aims to obtain an object, such as some reward or advantage for the aggres- sor; and (2) hostile aggression, which is closer to anger because its primary goal is to hurt the victim (Feshbach, 1964; Hartup, 1974). The latter is also known as impul- sive/expressive aggression: Actions are carried out in- voluntarily, in a burst of rage, with no weighing of costs and benefits but only a desire to injure or kill. Many authors have proposed other classifications of human aggression, which use different terms but consis- tently follow the same dichotomy, depending on whether the primary intent is distress or harm. On the one hand, there is the instrumental/controlled/proactive/cold- blooded/offensive/predatory/premeditated type. On the other hand, there is the hostile/impulsive/reactive/hot- blooded/defensive/affective/emotional, relatively invol- untary type (Ramirez & Andreu, 2003). Recent studies (Lansford et al., 2002; Poulin, Dishion, & Boivin, 2002) have even proposed the existence of positive aggression (leadership, socialization, reciprocal relationship and friendship with other proactive children, aggressive models . . .) and negative aggression (disruptive behav- ior, hostile attribution biases, internalizing problems, such as depression or somatization, and victimization). In this study, we explored only relations between he- donicity, and impulsive aggressive actions were the most genuinely aggressive ones, with no other apparent desire than to hurt. Even though reward may be typical of in- DOI 10.1027/1016-9040.10.2.xxxDOI 10.1027/1016-9040.10.2.xxx © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx strumental aggression, it is not necessarily absent from impulsive aggression. Our hypothesis was that people tend to make not only instrumental decisions but also impulsive ones as a function of the resulting pleasure they receive. We asked two main questions. First, can aggression be pleasurable? Second, because many ag- gressive behaviors are impulsive in nature, is there a re- lationship between impulsiveness and the tendency to maximize pleasure? To clarify any possible correlations between hedonic- ity and aggression, we examined how pleasure relates to several aggression-related variables. We selected these variables to represent three possible components of ag- gression: affective feelings (anger) cognition and tem- perament (impulsiveness) and overt behavior (justifica- tion of aggression). By understanding the role of emotions in social ag- gression, we may better understand its developmental origins and outcomes. Social aggression has usually been investigated independently of emotions, and this seems unfortunate. Anger represents the emotional or af- fective component of aggressive behavior, or at least of some kinds of it. Anger escalates if the source is seen to be intentional, preventable, unjustified, and blamewor- thy, and when values are compromised, promises bro- ken, expectations not met, rules violated, and personal freedom and rights infringed upon. Anger proneness may be seen as a personality trait that differs between individuals in the frequency over time of angry apprais- als of emotional situations (anger experience) and angry responses (readiness to act angrily) (Ramirez, Alvarado, & Santisteban, 2004; Ramirez, Fujihara, & Van Goozen, 2001; Ramirez, Fujihara, Van Goozen, & Santisteban, 2001; Ramirez, Santisteban, Fujihara, & Van Goozen, 2002; Van Goozen, Fridja, Kindt, & Van de Poll, 1994a; Van Goozen, Fridja, & Van de Poll, 1994b). Impulsiveness is a multidimensional concept that in- volves weak restraint of personal behavior, poor coordi- nation of different emotions, rapid processing of infor- mation, novelty seeking, and low ability to delay gratifi- cation. The balance of countervailing forces determines the resulting behavior. Impulsiveness has also been rec- ognized as a general process that underlies such major social problems as drug abuse, aggressive behavior, and suicide (Horesh, Rolnick, Iancu, Dannon, Lepkifker, Ap- ter, & Kotler, 1997). Obviously, it would be better to show that pleasure increases during or just after actual aggressive acts, as opposed to simply reporting hypothetical responses to aggression. Furthermore, some authors doubt the valid- ity of self-report in response to vaguely defined or hypo- thetical scenarios, arguing that self-report is distorted by a desire to give socially desirable responses or to enhance self-presentation. That is, when dealing with a socially unacceptable behavior such as aggression, respondents may be reluctant to admit the full extent of the behavior out of concern for the opinions of others and fear of dis- approval if they admit to engaging in aggressive action. It is possible to minimize this source of distortion by designing procedures and instructions to suggest that such behavior might be acceptable or justified and by concealing the respondent’s identity. Nonetheless, dis- tortion may persist because the hypothetical anger-pro- voking situation is rare or absent in the respondent’s own life or because risky aggressive response would in reality be inhibited by its high cost-to-benefit ratio (Björkqvist, Österman, & Lagerspetz, 1994). Talk is cheap, and imag- ination is even cheaper (O’Connor, Archer, & Wu, 2001). Besides the ethical advantage of not inflicting unnec- essary harm, self-report has proven itself in empirical measurement of aggression-related issues (Richardson & Green, 2003; Ramirez & Andreu, in press). We accept that respondents may not be honest about their aggres- sive behavior and may deny the extent of their aggres- siveness (Österman, Björkqvist, Lagerstetz, Kaukiainen, Huesmann, & Fraçzek, 1994). Richardson and Green (2003) examined this potential self-protecting bias in self-report by comparing self-report data with data from a peer who knew the respondent and reported on that person’s behavior. Self-reports of aggression were found to be moderately and significantly correlated with peer- reports of aggression (r = .55 and .58). Thus, there ap- pears to be some hesitancy to admit to aggressive behav- ior, but self-report does not “wipe out” occurrence of aggression via a floor effect. Although the reported level of aggression is lower for self-report than for peer-report, there is enough variability to reveal patterns among vari- ables. Self-report agrees with peer report, and similar patterns arise whether people report on the behavior of others or on their own. The same should hold true for anger and impulsiveness. Therefore, self-report seems to be an adequate approach. For this analysis, many possible self-report question- naires might be chosen. We selected three kinds, devel- oped for small groups, which we have used in our field research over the last two decades and which are specif- ically designed to assess different attitudes to interper- sonal aggression. The three kinds are: CAMA, which in Spanish means Questionnaire on Moral Attitudes to Ag- gression (see: Ramírez & Folgado, 1985); an adaptation of the Anger Situation Questionnaire (ASQ; VanGoozen et al., 1994a) to measure experienced anger and its ex- pression in assertive or aggressive ways; and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS; Barratt, 1994). To investigate attitudes to interpersonal aggression, and its degree of approval in different situations, the CAMA questionnaire was chosen, given its basic reliabil- ity and high internal consistency. It has been adminis- 2 J.M. Ramírez et al.: Aggression and Pleasure European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers tered to about 3000 respondents from 12 to 90 years old and from diverse cultural backgrounds, with scores rang- ing from .77 to .91 using Cronbach’s α coefficient. CAMA has been used to investigate personal attitudes to interpersonal aggression and normative beliefs about justifications for aggression in various situations in a wide range of societies including: Finland (Lagerspetz & Westman, 1980; Lagerspetz et al., 1988), Great Britain (Benton et al., 1982), Poland (Fraçzek et al., 1897; Fraç- zek, 1985), Spain (Ramírez, 1986, 1991, 1993; Andreu, 2000), Japan and the U.S.A. (Ramírez & Fujihara, 1997; Fujihara et al., 1999), Iran (Musazadeh, 1999), and South Africa (Theron et al., 2001) (for a review see: Ramirez, 2000; and Ramirez & Andreu, in press). The ASQ, rather than measuring actual anger, uses scenarios to assess how people feel about angry respons- es to a standard set of anger-provoking situations (Van- Goozen et al., 1994a, 1994b; Ramírez et al., 2001; Ra- mírez et al., 2002). Our Questionnaire 1 is inspired by this approach and measures the amount of pleasure/dis- pleasure that participants feel when shown varying de- grees of aggressive response to social stress in everyday life. The BIS is the first self-report technique developed specifically to measure impulsiveness (Barratt, 1959). We used the 11th version: BIS 11 (Barratt, 1994). The total score of BIS-11 is an internally consistent measure of impulsiveness (Cronbach’sα = .82 in normals and .83 in psychiatric patients; Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995). The BIS has found three subcomponents of im- pulsiveness: (a) Motor impulsiveness (Im), defined as acting without thinking (e.g., “I do things without think- ing”, “I act on the spur of the moment”); (b) Cognitive impulsiveness (Ic), making up one’s mind quickly (e.g., “I have racing thoughts”); and (c) Unplanned impulsive- ness (Inp), characterized as “present orientation” or “lack of futuring” (e.g., ”I am more interested in the pre- sent than in the future“) (Barratt, 1985). Methods Participants Fifty adult participants, 25 women and 25 men, were randomly recruited on campus. They were invited to par- ticipate when they happened to pass the department door. The only selection was to recruit equal numbers of men and women, with similar mean ages. The participants included students, technicians, clerks, and academics. The ages ranged from 16 to 80 with a mean of 39.0 ± 3.3 for the women and 39.4 ± 3.4 for the men (Student’s t= 0.076, n.s.). The participants responded anonymously to all four questionnaires. Procedures Hedonicity of Aggressiveness Questionnaire 1 measured the pleasure/displeasure that the participants felt with respect to varying levels of ag- gressive response to everyday social stress. It described 17 hypothetical scenarios from daily life in which the participant would encounter annoying people. Each sce- nario offered the participant five possible responses, from doing nothing and passively accepting the annoy- ance to reacting vigorously and aggressively (see Appen- dix 1 for an example). The five levels of aggressive re- sponse were: (1) minimal (complete passivity), (2) low, (3) medium, (4) high, and (5) very high. There were 17 scenarios, each one offering five possible responses for a total of 85 items (17 × 5). To ensure randomness, the items were presented in varying orders of aggressiveness level. The same 17 scenarios were presented five times with five different sets of responses. To control for se- quence effects, they were presented to half the partici- pants (13 women and 12 men) with Items 1 to 85 (Ques- tionnaire 1a) and to the other half (12 women and 13 men) with Items 85 to1 (Questionnaire 1b). After reading each scenario and response, the partici- pants rated their pleasure/displeasure. This experience was rated on a scale of magnitude starting at zero = in- different. No further instructions were given as the actual self-selected magnitude was of no importance. Each par- ticipant was to be compared with her/himself. Such a within-subject approach gives each participant total free- dom to choose, thus strengthening the validity of the re- sults. Most participants spontaneously used a range ca. –20 to +20. Preference for Pleasure Questionnaire 2 was multiple choice and, thus, provided ordinal data: Each scenario of Questionnaire 1 was im- mediately followed by its five possible responses; the participant marked the one she/he would actually adopt. The participants who had received the reverse sequence of Questionnaire 1b also received Questionnaire 2b with a reverse sequence of the 17 scenarios. When debriefed, the participants did not seem to have been influenced by the sequence of Questionnaire 1 when filling out Ques- tionnaire 2, as most of them were unaware that they had selected, on Questionnaire 2, the item they had enjoyed the most from Questionnaire 1. Several declared sponta- neously: “I don’t know what you re looking for, but I’m sure I’ve ruined your experiment.” This unawareness was probably due to the high number of items (85) on Questionnaire 1. In addition, for reasons of time avail- ability, six participants answered Questionnaire 2 one day after Questionnaire 1. As their results were no differ- J.M. Ramírez et al.: Aggression and Pleasure 3 © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx ent from the others, it is likely that the sequence did not influence the results. Similar methods have been successfully used with grammatical decision making (Balaskó & Cabanac, 1998), mathematical decision making (Cabanac et al., 2002), video game playing, and enjoyment of poetry (Cabanac et al., 1997). Impulsiveness and Aggressiveness After Questionnaire 1 and before Questionnaire 2, the participants received another two questionnaires to test impulsiveness and attitudes to aggression. Questionnaire 3: Attitudes to interpersonal aggression were measured with the CAMA test, which contained 48 entries of aggressive behavior of different intensity: (1) a passive aggressive act (hindering), (2–4) verbal aggres- sion (shouting, being ironic, or rage, all three being at a similar level), (5) threat, (6) physical aggression (hit- ting), and (7–8) physical aggression (killing or torturing, both being at a similar level) (Ramírez et al., 2001). The participants were asked whether these responses would be appropriate in: (1) self-defence, (2) protection of somebody else, (3) severed communication, (4) anger, (5) defence of one’s property, and (6) punishment (See Appendix 2). They, thus, assessed their personal degree of approval of aggression in specific circumstances, and the recorded response provided an ordinal estimate. Questionnaire 4: The BIS 11 was used to explore im- pulsiveness. There were 30 items: 11 explored un- planned impulsiveness; 10, motor impulsiveness; and 9, cognitive impulsiveness. The recorded responses also provided an ordinal estimate. Statistical Analysis All results were analyzed by ANOVA (Statview_). Post hoc Fisher’s PLSD or Student’s t was used to compare individual means. Group results were compared as means in the case of parametric data, as were magnitude estimates; then, Student’s t was applied post hoc. With nonparametric data, such as frequencies, nonparametric post hoc tests were applied, as with the results of Ques- tionnaires 3 (CAMA) and 4 (Barratt). Results We analyzed the Questionnaire 1 ratings and their con- sistency with the subsequent Questionnaire 2 choices. All results were tested for possible sex differences. There were no significant differences between male and female means for any of the four questionnaires, so the results were pooled with male and female participants treated as a single group in the following analyses. Hedonicity and Aggressive Behavior The ranges of pleasure/displeasure ratings for Question- naire 1 items differed little from participant to partici- pant. Although no prior instruction was given about the range of the scale, the participants all spontaneously gave ratings within similar ranges. The Questionnaire 1 re- sults are presented, therefore, as crude means, taking into account that all participants were their own controls (Fig- ure 1). The suggested responses were generally rated un- pleasant. The most unpleasant ratings were assigned to the passive responses, i.e., the ones ranking the lowest in level of aggressiveness. Significantly less unpleasant were the medium-to-high responses (Levels 3 and 4). Ratings increased again in unpleasantness for the very high responses (Level 5). The results for each participant were condensed into one number that was the simple sum of the ratings for the five levels of aggressiveness in the 17 scenarios. The rating values given to all items were averaged for all 50 participants: The most aggressive responses had been given a mean rating of 3.10 ± 0.10, which was slightly but not significantly above the median of possible ratings -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 1 2 3 4 5MINIM.

Ramírez et al.: Aggression and Pleasure European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers (3.00; Student’s paired t test: 0.98, n.s.) as can be seen indirectly in Figure 1. Decision Making and Aggressiveness Figures 2 and 3 show the relationship between the choic- es of individual participants on Questionnaire 2 and their pleasure/displeasure recorded on Questionnaire 1. There were 17 multiple-choice questions, each with five possi- ble answers. If the participants had chosen randomly, they would have chosen the highest rating (or any rating) 3.4 times, i.e., 17/5. The highest rating was in fact chosen a mean of 7.9 ± 0.6 times, which is twice greater than chance (Student’s t = 7.69, p < .0001; Figure 2). Con- versely, the lowest rating was chosen a mean of 2.1 ± 0.3 times, which was also significantly below chance (Stu- dent’s t = 4.44, p < .0001; Figure 3). There was, thus, a consistency between the pleasure described for the 17 scenarios presented in 85 combina- tions on Questionnaire 1 and the behavior selected on Questionnaire 2. Participants tended to select more fre- quently than chance the behaviors they had most highly rated out of the five possible responses. Conversely, be- haviors selected the least frequently on Questionnaire 2, and below chance, received the lowest ratings on Ques- tionnaire 1. Most participants, therefore, avoided the be- haviors that were unpleasurable. The overall mean choices are presented in Figure 4. The mean level chosen by the 50 participants was 3.2 ± 0.1. This was significantly above chance, with 1 being the least aggressive response, 5 being the most aggres- sive response, and 3 being the mean if chance were the only factor (Student’s t = 2.58, p < .05). There was a significant negative correlation between, on the one hand, consistency in rating most highly the most pleasurable behavior and, on the other, consistency in rating least highly the least pleasurable (Z = –5.85, p < .0001). The participants who maximized pleasure tended to be the same as those who minimized displeasure, and the more they sought pleasure, the more they avoided discomfort.

This figure shows how and where the behaviors selected from Questionnaire 2 stand in comparison to the overall mean from Questionnaire 1.

The selected behaviors were described as slightly pleasant (+0.8 ± 0.7) and ranked slightly (but not significantly) above median aggressive- ness.

Ramírez et al.: Aggression and Pleasure 5 © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx Aggressiveness and Hedonicity There was no significant correlation between justifica- tion of aggression and pleasure maximization. There was, however, a significant positive correlation between justification of aggression and displeasure minimization (Z = 2.24, p < .05). Impulsiveness and Hedonicity No correlation was found between pleasure maximiza- tion, when making a choice among several possible re- sponses, and participant impulsiveness. Influence of Age There was a positive correlation between aging and jus- tification of aggression as measured by the CAMA test (Z = 2.18, p < .05), and a negative correlation between aging and impulsiveness, as measured by the Barratt tests (unplanned Z = –2.25, p < .05; cognitive Z = –3.24, p = .01; Figure 5). Yet this did not seem to influence the participants’ choices because age failed to correlate with either pleasure maximization or displeasure minimiza- tion. Discussion Hedonicity and aggression are both deeply rooted in bi- ology and have a long evolutionary history. Aggressive displays are present throughout practically the entire an- imal kingdom (Lorenz, 1963), and sensory hedonicity appears to go as far back as the reptiles in evolutionary history (Balaskó & Cabanac, 1998; Paradis & Cabanac, 2002). The present study aims to explore the relationship be- tween these two variables, to verify whether pleasure might serve aggression, or vice versa, and whether this interrelationship persists over a life span. This reward of moderate aggression – “aggression makes oneself feel better,” in the words of Bushman, Baumeister, and Phil- lips (2001) – was present in our results. The results show that pleasure does correlate with cognitive impulsiveness and aggressive behavior in response to mild social stress, but not extreme or severe aggression. Such a correlation between pleasure and behavioral choice may appear obvious. Yet this relationship is nei- ther obvious nor inevitable, as shown by the very fact that only one participant chose the most pleasurable behav- iors 100% of the time (Figure 2), that two participants systematically avoided the most pleasurable behaviors (Figure 2) and, finally, that two participants repeatedly chose the most unpleasant behaviors (Figure 3). Hedonicity and Experienced Aggressiveness The pursuit of pleasure does not necessarily lead to in- creasingly aggressive behavior. Indeed, although the par- ticipants chose aggressive responses, they did not choose the most aggressive ones. Thus, the correlation between pleasure and aggressiveness was not linear (Figure 1): A positive correlation existed up to a certain point, but fur- ther increments in aggressiveness were actually less pleasurable. Undoubtedly, the choices were influenced IM PU LS IV IV EN ES S CO GN IT IV E NO N- PL AN NI NG 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 AGE (yr) Figure 5.

Ramírez et al.: Aggression and Pleasure European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers by other outcomes, such as social acceptance, and prob- ably moral constraints. The preference for aggressive responses may be sup- ported not only by external rewards, as emphasized in Bandura’s social learning theory (1977, 1986), but also by internal cognitive factors, as suggested in his subse- quent formulation, under the name of “social cognitive theory”, which stresses the more explicit role of mental structures in guiding action (processes such as imitation, tuition, and feedback from one’s own behavior all guide self-regulatory mental processes) (Bandura, 1989; Bus- sey & Bandura, 1999), as well as in Berkowitz’s cogni- tive-neoassociationistic analysis (1990, 1993, 2000) e.g., an aggressor may derive pleasure from the tension reduc- tion resulting from awareness of injury to an antagonist. Feelings, like pleasure, can influence thought, memory, and action. Pursuing this line of research, Bushman et al. (2001) tried to prove Geen and Quanty’s catharsis hy- pothesis (1977): After giving some participants a bogus mood-freezing pill that supposedly made affect-regula- tion ineffective, they found that many people might en- gage in aggression to improve their own affective state. Hedonicity and Usefulness Motivation theorists are fundamentally interested in identifying the motivational process that is assumed to be present whenever some behavior occurs. It has been argued, for example, that the motivational processes un- derlying the development of any skill are “feelings of efficacy” (White, 1959) or that what motivates us to de- velop conceptual systems is the “positive affect” associ- ated with the moderate levels of arousal that frequently accompany information processing (Berlyne, 1960). Here, we might say that what motivates us to develop justified aggressive responses would be “feelings of pleasure.” Or, at least partially, because any given behav- ior is not necessarily governed by a single motive (Ca- banac, 1992). All organisms are motivated to maximize their indi- vidual and inclusive fitness, by means of a series of mechanisms oriented to finding effective solutions in the struggle for survival. We seek food, water, shelter, com- fort . . . and we may also seek gratification or pleasure. In fact, our previous research has shown that pleasure optimizes behavior. Maximization of sensory pleasure produces behaviors that are optimal for survival and re- production (Cabanac, 1971), and maximization of men- tal pleasure guides decision making for video games (Ca- banac et al., 1997), ethics, grammar (Balaskó & Caba- nac, 1998), and mathematics (Cabanac et al., 2002). Pleasure seeking, thus, seems to be a universal mecha- nism inherited by humans via natural selection to make prerational decisions. Ethologists have traditionally viewed aggression as an adaptive behavior. Certain behaviors are required if the animal is to survive. The fact that certain behaviors harm other animals is secondary to the survival instinct. There is no intentional motivation to harm the other animal. According to ethologists, aggression evolved in order to ensure the survival not only of the individual but also of the species (Tinbergen, 1951; Lorenz, 1963; Eibl-Eibes- feldt, 1970; Hinde, 1970). If aggressive behavior stops the behavior of an attacker, for example, it is likely that the tendency to engage in a similar kind of defence will increase (Hokanson & Edelman, 1966). Also, if aggres- sive behavior is adaptive, it should also be rewarding: Engaging in aggressive behavior can lead to a reward, to pleasure, which in turn will increase the tendency to be aggressive. It is not surprising, therefore, that people will often react aggressively, because many aggressive acts produce some pleasure. If we refer to Schacter-Singer’s (1962) theory on emotions (even if essentially cognitive, emotions are linked in their intensity to physiological responses), and the evolutionary perspective on opti- mism by Tiger (1979), it might be suggested that engage- ment in adaptive behavior, such as justified moderate aggression, should also increase a rewarding feeling, such as pleasure. Humans have been viewed as having certain biologi- cal capacities that need to be exercised if they are to experience basic satisfaction with day-to-day existence (Maslow, 1970; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). It may well be that certain aggressive behaviors represent an attempt to control the environment or to make it predictable. If we are threatened in some way, for example, our immediate reaction could be to regain control. We may tend to re- taliate in kind, especially if we have found that this strat- egy worked in the past. Given that mild aggressiveness elicited by social stress arouses pleasure, such as in the present study, it may be concluded that such aggressive attitudes, which lead to positive affect, may also be, or at least were in our more primitive ancestors, an efficacious and rewarding tool in our social interactions. This con- clusion bears no moral content, of course. Hedonicity and Rationality Even if it seems quite clear that the roots of human ag- gression run deep in evolution, the present civilized level of interpersonal relations have produced interesting modulations. Although most aggressive behaviors are in retaliation for provocation by the actions of others, and some are considered socially acceptable or even desir- able, we are usually conscious that other, better, more J.M. Ramírez et al.: Aggression and Pleasure 7 © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx sophisticated – and more pleasurable – ways exist to solve social problems, achieve goals, and carry out threats than through physical or direct aggression (Ramí- rez, 1996). Such restraint is not exclusive to humans; it has also been observed in other animal species; e.g., ag- gression interferes with cooperation in rats (Schuster et al., 1993). However, when these alternative responses have proven to be ineffective, aggression can be used as “a last resort.” Aggression may then be used to a rational end, being effective and consequently adaptive (Ramí- rez, 1996, 1998). Impulsiveness Common sense says that highly impulsive individuals are generally disadvantaged relative to others: They have a less than optimal strategy, reacting with little thought to the impulse-eliciting stimuli and without considering the socially defined appropriateness of their reaction (Wicks-Nerlson & Israel, 1997). Obviously, such indi- viduals differ in this tendency, as to be expected from differences in their respective aggressive personalities (Berkowitz, 1998), but this does not seem to influence their decisions. The results (see Figure 5) show that aggressiveness tends to rise with age and impulsiveness tends to de- crease. It is likely, therefore, that aggressiveness is not a result of impulsiveness. Mischel et al. (1989) character- ized infants as impulse-driven, unable to delay gratifica- tion, and suggested that future-oriented self-control de- velops with maturation. Although adults have a higher level of aggressiveness, they also should show more cog- nitive control, leading to suppression of excessive impul- siveness, unjustified aggression and extreme violence, or even immediate pleasure if it is more convenient to wait. Age Age is still a neglected variable in research on individual differences in pleasure and aggression, there being only a handful of psychological studies. The possible devel- opment of pleasure, impulsiveness, and aggression throughout our life span was not considered as a hypoth- esis in the present experiment, and consequently no pre- vious literature on the topic was reviewed. Our present findings, however, show that aggressiveness tends to in- crease with age and impulsiveness tends to decrease. Fu- ture researchers in this area should be aware that a bigger sample size and age distribution will be needed for more clearcut conclusions. As we age, we become more experienced, more ma- ture and, hopefully, more sophisticated. Consequently, we are expected to be in a better position to select those behaviors and feelings that better fit our desires. Specif- ically, we suggest that as people age they tend to maxi- mize pleasure, to have more rewarding and pleasant ex- periences, to use better adaptive strategies, including milder and more sophisticated kinds of aggression, and, at the same time, to decrease cognitive impulsiveness and the more disruptive forms of extreme violence. This is to be considered in the light of some recent reports on human aggression: An inverse association be- tween self-reported aggression and age, with lower val- ues at older ages among adults (see Archer, 2000; O’Connor et al., 2001). Explanations for the apparent contradiction may range from Quetelet’s (1833) empha- sis on declining physical strength (both strength and in- termale homicides peak between 25 and 30 years of age) and “passion”, to Daly and Wilson’s view (1988) that young men’s aggression represents reproductive compe- tition arising from sexual selection. However, another explanation might be offered for the above contradiction. It may be hypothesized that learning and maturation, i.e., deeper awareness that aggressive behavior provides cog- nitive pleasure, contributes to the increase in aggressive- ness; indeed, a better estimate of risk and benefit gradu- ally develops with age. Justification of extremely violent acts is much lower in adults: Most people find them utterly repugnant, un- ethical, unacceptable, and not so easily forgiven by soci- ety (Ramírez, 1986, 1991; Ramírez & Fujihara, 1997; Ramírez et al., 2001). Extremely disruptive aggression, therefore, tends to become less frequent with age. In animals, too, the frequency of direct aggression, which includes both overt threats and actual contact, de- creases with age. Since animals become stronger with increasing age, fighting becomes riskier and consequent- ly is avoided (Geist, 1971; Walther, 1974; Schaller, 1977; Alvarez, 1993). Conclusions Pleasure is, thus, a universal mechanism inherited by hu- mans to make prerational decisions (Cabanac, 1992; Ra- mírez & Cabanac, 2003; Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & Mc- Gregor 2002; Finucane, Peters, & Slovic, 2003). A par- allel position has been adopted by Mellers, who proposes an account of emotional experiences associated with de- cision outcomes called “decision affect theory.” It incor- porates utilities, expectations, and counterfactual com- parisons into hedonic responses. That is, people choose the risky options for which they expect to feel better on average (Mellers, 2000; Mellers et al., 1997). Our pre- sent results show (a) that aggressiveness in situations of 8 J.M. Ramírez et al.: Aggression and Pleasure European Psychologist 2005; Vol. 10(2):xxx–xxx © 2005 Hogrefe & Huber Publishers mild social stress can arouse pleasure even in impulsive people whereas extreme or severe aggression does not, and (b) that people tend to bring their behavioral deci- sions into line with their experience of pleasure. Thus, they respond aggressively to mild social stress, but avoid both passive and very aggressive responses. This point helps put things in perspective and potentially can recon- cile conflicting observations. It may be concluded, there- fore, that such an attitude has been evolutionarily adap- tive.
