ABSTRACT: 
Though a perennial problem in postcolonial Kenya, extrajudicial executions (EJE) show few signs of ending and in recent years are even accelerating amongst young men in informal settlements. Avenues for legal, institutional and civil society redress, nominally expanded in recent years, display an ongoing tendency towards disconnection from the grassroots. A case study from Mathare, Nairobi, seeks explanations for the lack of urgency in addressing EJE and also the limited effectiveness of responses to them that are rooted in the political economy of interests of civil society actors, which tends to perpetuate these ‘excluded spaces’ of the slum. The authors do so, however, by exploring one particular struggle to show how frustration with civil society is being used by social justice activists to articulate ideas of ‘everyday’ violence to mobilise for change that disrupts the apparent normalisation of EJE. 
 
PREDICTION: 
This article explores the emergence of a broader social movement in Kenya. It argues that the emergence of a broader political and political context of the slums in Kenya is a broader challenge to civil society. The paper argues that the emergence of a broader political and political context of the slums is a critical critical analysis of the broader political and political context of the slums. The paper argues that the broader political and political context of the slums is a critical critical process of a broader political and political context.

  1 2 3 ‘Only the People can defend this struggle’: The Politics of the Everyday, 4 5 Extrajudicial Executions and Civil Society in Mathare, Kenya 6 7 8 9 10 Introduction 11 12 13 14 A pistol shot rings out in Mathare, an informal settlement in Nairobi, in the early hours 15 of a chilly winter night. A mother, upon hearing the shot whose report rumbles through 16 17 the still air, puts on her slippers and walks out to investigate as she is concerned that her 18 19 teenage son is out late. She goes hurriedly to where the noise came from, and sees two 20 policemen about to shoot a young man dead at point-blank range. After remonstrating 21 22 with, she hears one of the policemen angrily say to the other: ‘Damn it! Because of her 23 24 interference we will have to let him go!’, which they reluctantly do. Merely another 25 26 unremarkable violent incident in the slums east of Nairobi, except for the woman’s 27 brave intervention that has allowed one lucky young man to secure reprieve from police 28 29 violence, at least for now.1 30 31 32 Hardly a week goes by without media reports of police shooting dead young men: one 33 34 week three ‘thugs’ are shot dead in daylight by police outside one of the author’s regular 35 36 coffee shops (Daily Nation 27 August 2014), another week five ‘thieves’ are killed at the 37 entrance to an upmarket estate in West Nairobi2; and another along one of the city’s 38 39 main highways.3 And so it continues. Apparently, the narrative of ‘thugs’, ‘thieves’, 40 41 ‘criminals’ and ‘gang members’, alone is sufficient to explain why these young men are 42 43 treated in either such a cruel and degrading manner, and, ultimately, ‘hunted’ and even 44 ‘finished’ by the police. To a large extent, a divisive public sentiment exists. For instance, 45 46 a quick scan of the comments section on the Facebook page of the Nairobi News after the 47 48 killing of 17-year-old Stephen Gichuru in Mathare by police on May 17, 2015, shows 49 strongly worded opinions for and against such violence. It is worth, though, highlighting 50 51 comments such as the one below by ‘Biggy’, which demonstrates the permeation of the 52 53 ‘live by the gun and die by the gun’ condemnatory rhetoric: 54 55 56 Most of these youths do not want decent honest careers even when they are 57 58 offered all opportunities. They prefer the quick money they get through violent 17 34 51 1 2 3 crimes. Let them be gunned down by police bullets if that is the only language 4 5 that they understand. 6 7 8 Beyond this rather common sentiment, when the extrajudicial executions happen 9 10 outside of the ‘slums’— like in those incidents listed above — the killings attract some 11 degree of media attention, laying publicly bare the state’s shoot-to-kill policy. But, 12 13 otherwise, like the earlier anecdote in the slums, such incidents usually go unreported 14 15 (Stephen Gichuru is one of the rare exceptions). Usually there the nation’s media is not 16 present to bear witness to the aftermath of shootings, which often involve unarmed 18 young men. Witnesses claim Bonokos -a popular term for weapons planted by the police 19 20 after the shootings- are often placed on the bodies of young men whose corpses were 21 22 still warm. The reality, therefore, is the continuous violence enacted upon young men 23 within the supposedly ‘other’ Nairobi: its slums. Why, then, do these events seemingly 24 25 occur with such frequency, and yet civil society does nt appear to offer radical ways of 26 27 tackling such violence. Or, put simply, following Pithouse (2015) who indeed ‘counts 28 and who doesn’t’ in the violent postcolonial city, and why? 29 30 31 32 The article looks at such experiences of ‘everyday violence’ in Mathare,4 and the 33 challenges civil society face in addressing the extrajudicial executions (EJE) of young 35 men. Above all, the paper seeks to better understand the apparent lack of any lasting 36 37 solutions to the problem and also why EJE appears to be a ‘normalised’ phenomenon in 38 39 Kenya. More specifically, since 2010, despite a purportedly transformational 40 constitution and multi-sector engagement in police and policy reform, the problem of 41 42 violence remains unabated, and as data shows, is worsening. Our analysis, therefore, 43 44 locates EJE, along with community-level demands for safety, within the broader terrain 45 of state and population interaction and political engagement (Chatterjee, 2004), as 46 47 illustrated through two important dynamics. First, we recognise the important role and 48 49 different contributions of a wide variety of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 50 addressing the deep-rooted problem of police violence. But in explaining the limited 52 impact of their responses we identify how ‘NGOisation’ has dented their impact. 53 54 Second, conversely, we highlight the grassroots struggles of activists in Mathare, often in 55 56 response to NGO interventions. We use participant observation of activities associated 57 with the Mathare Social Justice Centre (MSJC); these include field mobilisation events, 58 17 34 51 1 2 3 and community ‘dialogues’ that seek to document and raise awareness of the scope and 4 5 nature of EJE, and qualitative interviews with 8 activists. Our methodology and analysis 6 strives to incorporate the potential for ‘autonomous social forces’ (Hearn, 2007) to act. 7 8 9 10 In our reading of EJE, it is the politics of the everyday that shape understandings of 11 political engagement. It is this ‘everyday violence’ we seek to use to explain the seeming 12 13 disjuncture that exists between grassroots and particularly NGO efforts against EJE. 14 15 16 Theorizing The Politics of the Everyday: Engagement and Violence 18 Pithouse’s (2015) provocative piece describes how the spatial order of the colonial city 19 20 continues to structure interactions between the state and those governed – to the extent, 21 22 he argues, that we normalise the occurrence of police killings. Other authors support 23 this claim, such as Ndlovu-Gatsheni (2011:7), who argues that it is the ‘coloniality of 24 25 being’ that connects the colonial period to the present: the horror of colonial violence 26 27 enacted upon racialized subjects that becomes ‘routinised as the African mode of being’. 28 These are important elements in seeking to explaining the apparent fissure in political 29 30 responses to violence within the postcolonial city. Chatterjee (2004), however, deepens 31 32 our understandings of the dissonance between these excluded spaces where inhabitants 33 ‘are only tenuously, and even then ambiguously and contextually rights-bearing citizens 35 in the sense imagined by the constitution’ and ‘an actually existing arena of institutions 36 37 and practices inhabited by a relatively small section of the people’ (Chatterjee 2004:38). 38 39 Though it’s debatable whether Chatterjee underplays the potential for the state 40 extending rights to the excluded, the major contribution of his conceptual framework – 41 42 and of particular relevance here – is to identify a split in the political field: on the one 43 44 hand, civil society, as ‘the closed association of modern elite groups, sequestered from 45 the wider popular life of communities, walled up with enclaves of civic freedom and 46 47 rational law’; and on the other political society, which he defines as ‘large sections of 48 49 rural and urban poor, [who] make claims on government not within the framework of 50 stable constitutionally defined right and laws but direct political negotiations…’ 52 (Chatterjee 2004:4). What enables this political negotiation by the excluded is the shift 53 54 in state organisation towards governmentality and its attendant activities and 55 56 expectations, thus producing a new interface between government and the population, 57 according to Chatterjee. But his is not a disabling and depoliticising governmentality but 17 34 51 1 2 3 rather one that enables political encounters and negotiations. Chatterjee’s analysis is 4 5 also politically dynamic as it centres upon the everyday struggles of the excluded to 6 survive and eke benefits from state interventions and programmes. In so doing, 7 8 Chatterjee forcefully moves beyond some previous analyses that tend to regard the 9 10 grassroots as somehow “pre-modern” and in need of taming and civilising by ‘civil 11 society’. 12 13 14 15 But his framework (even allowing for modifications over the years), has opened up 16 several lines of critique (see Gudavarthy, 2014; Hart, 2015). Most problematically, 18 Chatterjee over-states the binary separation of civil and political societies (as if ‘oil and 19 20 water’ following Corbridge’s assessment in Gudavarthy, 2014), and underplays their 21 22 inter-connectivity in terms, for example, of how modern elites routinely break laws to 23 their own advantage. Conversely, many excluded communities strive for legal protection 24 25 even as they deal in illegal activities. Similarly, many voluntary associations that 26 27 comprise political society in fact have to mirror the regulatory structures of NGOs within 28 civil society, such as registration and the official organizational hierarchies to achieve a 29 30 particular status. Rather, what may be taking place is the use of different types of 31 32 political engagement rather than any real empirical difference between them (see 33 individual chapters in Gudavarthy, 2014). Furthermore, Chatterjee’s lens of 35 governmentality – this is arguably less relevant in Nairobi’s neglected slums devoid of 36 37 the most basic of government programmes – is criticized for lacking a transformative 38 39 potential because of his focus on incremental micro-politics. It can also be argued that 40 the lack of radical potential is also underemphasized because Chatterjee does not look at 41 42 broader social movements that contest state sovereignty. Chatterjee, however, 43 44 maintains that he is simply not seeing that kind of politics in his fieldwork. 45 46 47 These criticisms, and indeed Chatterjee’s erudite responses to them (2011, 2014), not 48 49 withstanding, his analysis remains of central significance precisely because of the 50 persistent zones of exclusion, like those in which young men in Mathare find themselves. 52 Certainly, these spaces are and can be breached. But what if that is the exception rather 53 54 than, as we see it, the norm of exclusion? We recognise Chatterjee’s continuing relevance 55 56 for what we are seeing in Nairobi. However, we also believe that his version of 57 governmentality unfortunately tends to obscure the violence and brutality that is the 17 34 51 1 2 3 dark underside not only of governmentality, but also of how that violence embeds itself 4 5 in the the politics of the ‘everyday’. 6 7 8 By extending these claims it becomes clear that an integral feature of the urban 9 10 postcolonial condition is the experience of different forms of violence – a condition that 11 has clear implications for Kenya’s development more broadly, and more specifically the 12 13 ability of young men from impoverished conditions to survive and thrive. In addition to 14 15 Pithouse’s and Ndlovu-Gatsheni’s assertions, and with reference to Chatterjee, this 16 paper deploys Das’ (2007) work on the ‘descent into the ordinary’ as the primary 18 conceptual tool to understand the logic of everyday police violence and people’s 19 20 responses to it. We argue that the way grassroots activists articulate their lived 21 22 experiences of extrajudicial killings – from dealing with the loss of family members, 23 neighbours and friends, to the real and perceived dangers of walking through certain 24 25 parts of Mathare – is ‘a mutual absorption of the violent and the ordinary’ (Das 2007: 7). 26 27 It is through these processes to define and defeat such acts of extreme violence and their 28 associated trauma, that activists create their own theory of violence: one that frames 29 30 their strategies and intentions particularly vis-à-vis NGOs and more importantly sheds 31 32 light on why and how they themselves have mobilised. The emphasis on the ‘ordinary’, 33 ‘everyday’ or ‘normal’, as inspired by Das’ work, is highly important to this discussion as 35 it feeds into the debate described in greater detail below, regarding whether NGOs can 36 37 actually capture the essence of what local people – in this case in Mathare – experience 38 39 and subsequently mobilise in productive and meaningful ways. 40 41 42 Focusing primarily on the women who suffered abduction, rape, and the murder of 43 44 husbands, brothers and sons during the Indian Partition (1947) and anti-Sikh massacres 45 (1984), Das argues that her interlocutors define themselves as ‘subjects’ in unexpected 46 47 ways. More specifically, rather than creating an ‘opposition between the experience of 48 49 violence as a victim/survivor and that of the subject … [it is] the ability to recraft the 50 symbols and genres of mourning that made them active in the highly contested domain 52 of politics’ (217). We extend her incisive analysis to the context of EJE in Mathare: it is 53 54 the very narrativisation of everyday experiences that enables the grassroots movement 55 56 studied to separate itself and articulate a difference from the NGO work currently taking 57 place, as will be discussed in the later sections. They can identify as victims but this 17 34 51 1 2 3 positioning has multiple ‘plot-lines’ and repertoires that do not indicate a 4 5 submissiveness or defeat. On the contrary, for these activists it is precisely ‘victims’ who 6 simultaneously hold agency in halting the everyday violence that frames their lives, a 7 8 violence that they know most acutely as it has become mundane. Therefore, like the 9 10 women Das (2007) speaks of, this understanding (or theory) of violence as part of 11 everyday life allows activists to self-identify beyond the framing purely of ‘victims’ and 12 13 instead recognise themselves as people best positioned to encroach and halt this 14 15 violence in its everyday manifestations. Thus, for Mathare social justice activists the 16 violence is linked to the ‘normal’ or ‘everyday’ – through comments about the frequency 18 of such deaths, the sense that it is a ‘normal’ way to die, but also that it must be a normal 19 20 and everyday fight to halt its fight, and preserve life in their community. 21 22 23 What makes this study timely and of deep empirical and theoretical interest – in 24 25 addition to the deep ‘ethics of responsibility’ (ibid: 218) that we as researchers feel 26 27 when documenting violence – is the youth-led aspect of this work and their focus on the 28 ‘everyday’. The ‘shared symbols’ through which activism becomes materialised is 29 30 intertwined with youth and local marginalisation from NGO spaces (due to age, 31 32 experience, language and other barriers), the commonality of experience that often 33 becomes lost in translation through regimented and bureaucratic ways of operating at 35 NGOs, and the very real risks that activists take on that NGO staff often do not bear. 36 37 38 39 We thus seek to link this very anthropological and geographical understanding of social 40 worlds and lived experiences to development studies and understandings of civil 41 42 society: namely, how do NGOs fit into this ‘normalised violence’ and at what points are 43 44 divergent (anti)politics between civil society and political society (Chatterjee, 2004) 45 created at the grassroots level? 46 47 48 49 Extrajudicial Executions in Kenya 50 While there has been literature on police violence in informal settlements, particularly 52 in the Latin American and South Asian context (see Auyero, 2012 and Mehta, 2004), the 53 54 Kenya-based literature is largely focused on the 2007 and 2013 elections and 55 56 furthermore, the intersection of everyday violence and justice efforts is particularly 57 understudied. 17 34 51 1 2 3 4 5 EJE, torture and cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of the police have been 6 ever-present stains on Kenya’s human rights record. Prior to and following 7 8 independence in 1963, there have been gross human rights violations associated with 9 10 each administration. From the post-1991 era, though civil-society organisations (CSOs) 11 started using the newly available opportunities to engage in democratic spaces, police 12 13 reform has still lagged. It is equally important to note that despite the new arena for 14 15 engagement, some five years prior to the enactment of the constitution, Holmquist’s 16 (2005:213) pertinent observations about the ‘gap’ between the national level and 18 popular demands. 19 20 21 22 The ‘gap’ resonates with the approach by Chatterjee (2004), mentioned earlier, which 23 suggests caution when immediately celebrating the declaration in 2010 of a new 24 25 Constitution, that included a Bill of Rights with articles on protection from torture, and 26 27 cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. Though clearly very important 28 features of the new dispensation, these provisions have not proven sufficient in 29 30 prohibiting torture and providing redress clauses. One of the key drivers of torture, for 31 32 example, is the strong correlation in Kenya between the power to arbitrarily arrest and 33 unlawfully detain an individual. Criticisms include the ‘persistent allegations of on-going 35 EJE, enforced disappearances, and excessive use of force by police officers, especially 36 37 during ‘special operations’, as well as the low rate of investigations, and prosecutions of 38 39 such acts’ (see UNCAT, 2013). Furthermore, there has also been a paradigm shift away 40 from political victims of torture to one of ‘everyday’ abuses associated with the 41 42 criminalisation of poverty and police excessive use of firearms. These drivers all suggest 43 44 that substantive protection and promotion of human rights requires a legal, policy and 45 institutional framework (KHRC, 2013) and, we should add, grassroots mobilisation of 46 47 civil society. Many CSOs have pro-actively sought to reposition and renew their 48 49 relevance for an era laden with possibilities for reform. However, in transitional states 50 such as Kenya, a salient reminder is that:’[t]he cohabitation between politicians and civil 52 society organisations, particularly those in the human rights and democracy sector, 53 54 becomes a delicate balance’ (Miano, 2009: 226). 55 56 57 F 17 34 51 1 2 3 It is a balance currently being tested by two inter-related challenges: state responses 4 5 and public reaction to waves of insecurity and violations by the state plaguing the 6 country (Open Society, 2013); and also the politics surrounding the International 7 8 Criminal Court (ICC) cases, which have also engulfed state-civil society relations. Though 9 10 there are new possibilities for engagement, Kenyan civil society activists are very 11 concerned about state-led attacks on CSOs that induce unpredictability in the policy and 12 13 political environment (Kiai, 2013). Another enduring challenge is therefore the level of 14 15 impunity following abuses that have been ‘normalised and institutionalised’ in Kenya 16 (TJRC, 2013). In relation, a vital ingredient in police reforms concerns whether an 18 adequate balance between internal and external stimuli can be created to support 19 20 incentives for substantive change. Evidence suggests that it is the top echelon of police 21 22 services that needs to embrace reforms and then convey them to the rank-and-file police 23 culture. But in Kenya it is precisely ‘the top’ that understand the police force as a means 24 25 to exert political control and maintain vested interests (Hornsby, 2013). 26 27 28 The police are considered to be the most corrupt and least trusted public institution in 29 30 the country (see Hornsby 2013). Since 2002, with a genuine multi-party transition, NGO 31 32 and police activity has taken place, as mentioned, within a landscape of political and 33 policy reform. Yet, the need for broader systemic reform soon became apparent as the 35 Kibaki administration began to utilise older modes of state repression – as seen under 36 37 Moi’s authoritarian government – most notably, with the renewal of EJE. One 38 39 organisation tracked 1,873 deaths resulting from gunshot wounds over a five-year 40 period, 87% of which occurred in Nairobi (IMLU, 2014). While the majority of these 41 42 deaths (67%) occurred during law enforcement interventions, it was often unclear the 43 44 circumstances of police involvement, particularly why the use of deadly force became 45 necessary. While we would argue that this is a very conservative tally, even this low-ball 46 47 figure amounts to effectively one police death every day for five years – a situation that 48 49 is unfortunately considered ‘normal’ by mainstream media and the many members of 50 the public. Another organisation, the Oscar Foundation Free Legal Clinic, released a 52 report in 2008 that documented at least 8,000 young men had been killed by the police 53 54 in what was, ostensibly, a crackdown on the Mungiki movement.5 A year after that 55 56 report was released, human rights lawyer Oscar Kingara and his collaborative 57 researcher John Paul Oulu were assassinated, ironically in a similar fashion to the very 17 34 51 1 2 3 extra-judicial killings they sought tirelessly to document. The Oscar Foundation Free 4 5 Legal Clinic was the only formal organisation that came close to documenting what was 6 being lived on the ground (for instance, one of the authors worked with young women in 7 8 one ward in Mathare constituency between 2007-9, and many of these women had 9 10 husbands and brothers, even a sister, who had been disappeared. Some of these families 11 are still haunted by the fact that they never found the bodies of their kin to bury). 12 13 14 15 While not to the same extent as the ‘Mungiki period’ (i.e. the period of EJE and 16 disappearance of militia members, particularly, 2006-2007), young people, especially 18 young men, are still being shot at an alarming rate in Mathare and other poor urban 19 20 settlements. An extrajudicial working document compiled by Mathare Social Justice 21 22 Centre, itself a complex and arduous task due to the trauma, silence and fear that 23 circulate around these killings, shows that most of the young people shot are under age 24 25 30 and have been framed by the police post-killing as ‘thieves’ or ‘threats to security’.6 26 27 Furthermore, their families tend not to register a case with NGOs, or, the police or police 28 oversight committees for a variety of structural factors including lack of bus fare, fear 29 30 and overall distrust of these bodies. For those who do register a case, it is a story of 31 32 being engulfed in the bureaucratic ‘politics of waiting’ (Auyero 2012) (referred to in 33 police-speak as ‘further investigations’) that is exacerbated by widely held ideas of 35 young men in Mathare as criminals deserving of death. 36 37 38 39 NGOs and Democratic Space: Professionalisation to What Effect? 40 A well-developed literature has emerged on NGOs, looking not only at their 41 42 contributions but also a critical examination of their practices and structures (see Lewis 43 44 and Kanji, 2009; Hearn, 1998, 2001; Mercer, 2002 amongst others). In recent years, 45 debates have begun to identify, more explicitly, the specific ways in which many NGOs 46 47 are not only complicit in furthering neo-liberal modes of contesting the state but also in 48 49 acting at the expense sometimes of those they claim to be supporting. The emphasis on 50 donor driven accountability also contributes to de-politicising NGO work and to further 52 reflect the regulation and containment of grassroots and other community-based 53 54 struggles. Managers are pressured to ‘professionalise’ (O’Flahtery and Ulrich, 2010), and 55 56 act, seemingly, with middle class interests. There are additional aspects to the process of 57 professionalisation, including, for example, how NGOs become side-tracked by having to 13 1 2 3 fulfil contractual obligations to strengthen and perform technical and managerial 4 5 capability. Our aim here is not to rehash these debates but to rather explore whether 6 NGOs, specifically in Mathare, meaningfully capture what local people experience and 7 8 subsequently mobilise in inclusive and productive ways. 9 10 11 In Kenya, for example, NGOs frame EJE as part of the current sinister ‘counter-terrorism’ 12 regime to attract money from larger human rights bodies such as Amnesty International. 14 This narrow perspective does not view EJE as part of the very longue duree of colonial 15 16 and neo-colonial urban governance that legitimises these kinds of violence(s). Moreover, 17 18 the spatial dimension of EJE – as specific ‘killing spots’ in slums and the heightened 19 occurrence in the wider Mathare locale itself – is disregarded. 20 21 22 The following section looks at responses of contemporary grassroots human rights 23 24 activists in Mathare, as well as residents’ concerns regarding issues of EJE. 25 26 27 Grassroots Engagement 28 29 Youth have been a longstanding part of daily life in Mathare. Due to a climate of the very 30 31 legitimate fear that surrounds mobilisation, it is only in the last few years that they have 32 been more explicit about and comprehensively organising around these killings. We 33 34 draw on interviews from eight respondents who form most of the core members (and 35 36 creators) of the Mathare Social Justice Centre (MSJC). Our main discussion with these 37 youth activists living in the Mathare constituency focused on the creation of MSJC: the 38 39 focus from the onset on EJEs and why the activists felt it was necessary to come together 40 41 despite the number of NGOs working on EJE issues. We also draw on our observations 42 43 from four public fora held by MSJC, where local community members aired grievances 44 and suggested ways forward; the first three events attracted over 80 participants at 45 46 each. These fora have been important public events to situate a response to EJE in the 47 48 ‘everyday’, as residents make efforts to link violence to the social fabric, in a vein similar 49 to the work by Das (2004) mentioned earlier. 50 51 52 53 One respondent, when asked about why she had joined the MSJC, and chose a leadership 54 position, identified a deeply embedded context of police brutality. She drew on her own 55 56 terrifying encounters with the police and, more traumatic, the killing of her brother by 57 issue that was constantly raised was the issue of fear. People feared that if they said anything ‘tomorrow it would be them’ and so many of them were guarded and refrained from talking for fear of informers. This makes us wonder whether Article 26 of the constitution which gives us the right to life means anything.7 16 28 37 1 2 3 the police. Common to the accounts of the activists we interviewed, she also talked about 4 5 the current and on-going police actions in her settlement: 6 7 8 I want to see the police behave. I want police to give us peace and respect us as 9 citizens of Kenya. Police are very notorious. I was with dad and I had left my 10 phone. I went to the house to get it…there was darkness and no electricity for last 11 12 three days in the settlement. As I went back I heard gunshots and I was told by 13 my dad to get into the house but I peek...I can see three policemen…they have 14 cuffs and they are beating people seriously, and then shooting into the air…I go 15 out and watch…a person being beaten is shouting saying they are not doing 17 anything wrong and the police are saying “shut up”- I want this to stop! I feel the 18 police are not competent…and it’s the same one misbehaving several times… 19 (R6). 20 21 22 Her references to electricity outages, gunshots, police brutality, and vulnerable shack 23 24 dwellings, all invoke insecure spaces. Indeed, one MSJC-organised forum, though 25 26 intended to explicitly explore EJE, saw participants share such experiences linked to 27 broader structural issues, such as the pattern of land-grabbing and, in addition, the 29 climate of fear that pervades Mathare: 30 31 32 33 At the meeting we shared experiences with land-grabbing and extrajudicial 34 killings, and the connections between these that occur due to the collaborations 35 between landowners, the chief, the city council and the police who threaten many 36 youth including our members… While we spoke and shared with each other, one 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Everyday concerns are therefore invoked alongside rights enshrined in the Kenyan 46 Constitution. But action is inhibited by fear; it is this ‘tomorrow’ and the fear of not living 47 48 to see it that deepens what the everyday means for residents. MSJC members regard the 49 50 difference between themselves and other actors in the community as how they were less 51 52 afraid of tackling issues compared to others. Many of the group members often voiced 53 how they are were ‘tired of losing generations’ and did not want to see that happen 54 55 anymore. Another respondent (R7), for example, had been a former gang member. After 56 57 seeing his entire ‘squad’ of 15 members killed either by the police or rival gangs, and the sentiment from many people was “why should we give birth when the police are killing our children with such impunity?”’…(ibid.). 1 2 3 shock of being the only survivor, this respondent was compelled to challenge the gang’s 4 5 fatalism and the apparent expendability of young men in the slum and so he joined MSJC. 6 7 8 Another theme, or ‘shared symbol’ to draw on our earlier discussion of Das (2004) has 9 10 been the activists’ rejection of the pervasive labelling of young men as ‘thieves’; MSJC 11 members and audiences have instead inverted this discourse, labelling police and 12 13 political leaders as the real ‘thieves’ and ‘criminals’ of the country. Similarly, another 14 15 narrativisation tactic is to evoke concerns of childbirth and parenting, but in the specific 16 context of the everyday inevitability of the police killing their children because ‘[T]he 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Themes therefore emerged that lay the foundations for a divergence between residents 24 25 and their everyday, and those actors supposedly representing them. One particularly 26 27 important set of actors are NGOs. And in specific discussions with activists, several 28 additional themes emerged from interviews. 29 30 31 32 The Grassroots and NGOs 33 The activists depicted a metaphoric gap, along the lines of that mentioned by Chatterjee 34 35 earlier, between themselves - as grassroots - and the NGOs. For instance, one 36 37 respondent described NGOs in the following terms: ‘They only recognise the people “up 38 39 there”, whereas we feel we are not being supported as we are “down here” [literally in a 40 valley]. And the NGOs act as cartels8 for their own self-interests; work with bigger 41 42 people and do not address our issues.’ The same respondent also explained this ‘gap’ in 43 44 terms of the lack of appropriate actors to whom she could turn to and provide the 45 extensive data on violence –including gun shots- she collected on a monthly basis 46 47 because the ‘bigger’ actors did not demonstrate any interest. 48 49 50 In relation, a particular affront to local activists was the perceived lack of presence on 51 52 the ground of NGOs purportedly working on EJE. One high profile event was evoked by 53 54 respondents who attended (R2,3,8). It concerned a ‘field day’ by the Kenyan National 55 56 Human Rights Commission (KNHRC) to document cases, at an event held at the Huruma 57 Sports grounds prior to the election in 2013. But activists strongly criticised the event as 17 1 2 3 a sham because they argued that there were inadequate attempts to work with local 4 5 activists in advance, which was also reflected in poor numbers attending. One spoke 6 about KNHRC’s fleeting presence, and how she observed that many of the tents erected 7 8 for the day remained empty because the organisers had not effectively mobilised the 9 10 community, again indicating tenuous links to the community. 11 12 13 In addition, another (R8), also accused the KNHRC of using a locally compiled report 14 15 inaccurately and, indeed, as a result, grossly undercounting the prevalence of EJE in the 16 settlement. What is interesting to note is how the activists’ criticism of the event was 18 articulated angrily by reference to differences in class, in terms of the status and also 19 20 geographic isolation of the organisation (more accurately, a government commission) in 21 22 question in its posh suburb of Nairobi. Indeed, these attributes were all regarded as 23 indicting lack of relevance to the community: 24 25 26 27 The police and the Kenyan National Human Rights Commission [and others] 28 came out to us for a field day. And we said: “Don’t you come here in your suits 29 30 and in your big cars … because we are the ones who deal with the violations … 31 32 this is why we are proposing our own centre [MSJC].”(R3). 33 34 35 For local activists, such an event therefore epitomised the apparent gap between 36 37 ‘respectable’ civil society and their insincerity in working with the local community. 38 Additional contributory factors to the perceived ‘gap’ also concerned levels of education. 39 40 Some activists suggested that lower education, also denoted by a lesser ability to speak 41 42 ‘good’ English, formed a social barrier that inhibited activists from going engaging civil 43 44 society. The grassroots then becomes reified as being ‘on the ground’ and maintaining 45 the habitus and vernacular of the community themselves. 46 47 48 49 Disproportionate Risks and Costs 50 Almost all the respondents also highlighted the nature of a ‘gap’ in terms of resources 51 52 and disproportionate risk, both of which often overlapped. For human rights activists 53 54 and residents, making reports about incidents at the local level could prove a serious 55 risk for themselves and their families. More specifically, if the confidentiality or the 56 57 34 51 1 2 3 guarantee of protection could not be promised, then giving evidence against a violator 4 5 meant risking becoming a victim: 6 7 8 A major challenge here in Mathare is witnessing cases- people always ask about 9 10 their safety if they act as witnesses. People fear giving reports; and people also 11 are not aware of witness protection and they don’t feel it in any case. For 12 13 example, I would choose not to if it meant… [that] I might be covered and 14 15 protected but my children and family would not. (Respondent 2). 16 17 18 In relation, there is a sizeable cost burden in getting victims help, and this includes, for 19 20 instance, transporting the victim to the hospital and potentially helping with 21 22 recuperation costs. The paucity of resources was keenly felt especially in contrast to 23 those of the big NGOs. 24 25 26 27 Professionalism of NGOs/Civil Society 28 Associated with the disconnect mentioned above, the respondents talked about a sense 29 30 of exclusion from NGOs, where they felt disqualified because they did not possess 31 32 ‘proper’ education credentials. It was a double-edged complaint: on the one hand 33 respondents conveyed a sense of being overlooked, but also acknowledged that one 35 could never qualify for a job given the insurmountable educational barriers. Both the 36 37 social and geographic gaps coalesce in the activists’ understanding of their position vis- 38 39 à-vis NGOs: namely that ‘NGOs don’t employ people from the slums,’ (R1) nor do they 40 appear to listen to the voices from these spaces. 41 42 43 44 The critique activists made of NGOs having strict educational qualifications is also 45 tempered by the rejection of what they depicted as a ‘soul-less’ pursuit of degrees, a 46 47 careerism that seemed to take the energy out of the movement. One leading human 48 49 rights defender puts it as follows: ‘We had a movement in place, but after the donors 50 came then it became about degrees and the professionalism has killed passion. And no 52 new cadres with an understanding of human rights are emerging. The movement is no 53 54 longer growing’ (R1). 55 56 57 17 34 1 2 3 The same activist also drew out some other less obvious implications of 4 5 professionalisation, namely, in terms of what it meant for strategising and tactics for 6 furthering human rights struggles: 7 8 9 10 I think [the National level NGO in question] directors and staff, they would not 11 feel ok to take coffins of extra- judicial killings victims to parliament building or 12 13 to the office of the Inspector general of police … as a way of protest, as before 14 15 ...which was our activism, our court appearance solidarity and, now, this kind of 16 human rights activism is not for professional human rights workers who are 18 looking for career in government human rights agencies, in boards of Directors, 19 20 are magistrates and middle class working in the government. 21 22 23 But this is of course not to say that activists themselves are not looking for enhanced 24 25 opportunities that NGOs also represent. Many could, for example, rattle off the number 26 27 of workshops and trainings provided by NGOs that they had attended. Furthermore, 28 activists all drew instrumentally upon seeking (limited) protection that some NGOs can 29 30 offer, particularly to local human rights defenders. Some respondents had even been 31 32 employed short term by NGOs and let go of for varying reasons. Though there are 33 clearly overlapping interests, which sometimes coalesce, it does not dissipate the sense 35 of exclusion from access to resources and influence that the NGOs command. Activists 36 37 repeatedly scorned the waste of resources by NGOs –for instance, inappropriate training 38 39 in expensive hotels or ‘fake’ local workshops- in contrast to their actual needs and 40 struggles not being met. Indeed, knowing how much in the way of resources are directed 41 42 to the professional human rights sector and that only a tiny amount trickles to local 43 44 activists work in slums, and that they face various barriers, is likely another important 45 reason for regarding NGOs as distant from the ‘everyday’. 46 47 48 49 Data ‘mining’ 50 Alongside the emergence of professionalism, another inter-related effect concerning the 51 52 shift to evidence based interventions is the role of information gathering and 53 54 compilation, and the attendant use of research and reports. A widespread view existed 55 of NGOs as too preoccupied with mining informal settlements for information without 56 57 any feedback loop or process to follow-up the report writing. In other words, activists 17 52 1 2 3 considered them as opportunistic ‘parachute’ researchers and consultants. This 4 5 attribution stemmed from a perception that NGOs needed to be seen as evidence based, 6 as if engaged with the grassroots, and so heavily relied on ‘producing’ data from 7 8 informal settlements towards the ends of their funding cycle, bearing in mind that their 9 10 report writing periods needed to demonstrate an ‘engagement’ with the grassroots. This 11 tendency, inevitably, according to the activists, resulted in a superficial presence. 12 13 Respondents recalled an event where another high profile NGO documenting EJE and 14 15 building forensic evidence for specific cases, invited local young men and members from 16 the local police force to discuss crime and policing in Mathare. Throughout the 18 proceedings, local activists were concerned at how the meeting became an opportunity 19 20 for the police to profile young men and gather information that was then used against 21 22 them being passed on to the local police station to identify attendees who had 23 perpetrated the crimes. The forum ended up generating conflict at community level, and 24 25 the NGO in question did not return, nor did any subsequent follow up of the situation to 26 27 mitigate this tension. As a consequence, the issue of information extraction was 28 therefore associated both with the risk of sharing information and also the use and 29 30 validity of the findings and misplaced sending priorities resources. As articulated by one 31 32 respondent (R2): 33 34 35 Whereas an NGO is just an office, maybe [with] nice computers, but we are the 36 ones with the information and it is risky for us…We feel donors don’t realise the 37 challenges we face- and so they don’t get the real report. Big organisations don’t 38 39 know me. We don’t know how they will use information nor about the impact- so 40 many people don’t bother to approach them. 41 42 43 The use of reports was associated with spaces other than within which the information 44 45 was gathered. Respondents described their own role in assisting in the report process, 46 but then only for the final product to be presented in distant fora, not only in elite 47 48 spaces of Nairobi but also in New York and London, which were simply inaccessible for 49 50 the people whose violations were the basis of the reports. The perception of data and 51 experiences extracted in order to feed an image designed for ‘impact’ on donors and the 53 national media were considered as further proof of divorce from the grassroots 54 55 56 57 Ethnicity 17 34 51 1 2 3 Another barrier identified by activists involving NGOs included the role of ethnicity and 4 5 how this politicised accountability. Most visibly, respondents made a link to the broader 6 contemporary problem of the politicisation and active encouragement of ethnic 7 8 divisions by politicians in Mathare, and in the country at large. There had been several 9 10 instances of the harassment of local human rights defenders, especially those who shone 11 light on the corrupt actions of local politicians. Respondents described how the human 12 13 rights movement was dealt a severe blow by alleged ‘violators’ being voted through 14 15 their parties into national government. In relation, the ICC cases also encouraged an 16 ethnicisation of human rights issues. Instances involved human rights defenders, from 18 the President’s ethnic group, who were allegedly rewarded either to act as spies for the 19 20 ruling Jubilee coalition or inproviding deliberately false evidence at the ICC hearings. 21 22 23 But ethnicisation had already started and apparently escalated in the transition from 24 25 Moi’s KANU regime to the next administration led by Mwai Kibake. Respondents spoke 26 27 about their perception of the ethnicisation of institutions and actors, and how several 28 NGOs were perceived as predominantly representing the interests of one or other 29 30 particular ethnic group. It has led to implications for whether or not cases are pursued. 31 32 In dealing with sensitive information about perpetrators, for example, ethnic affiliation 33 is not considered neutral but rather added in as a factor in the calculation of risk. All 35 respondents mentioned that they would think twice about approaching particular NGOs 36 37 because of their ethnic outlook, due to it being both pointless but also potentially 38 39 dangerous. One (R3) mentioned, for example, how he had collected what he perceived 40 as strong evidence on three policemen involved in EJE. But he feared the consequences 41 42 of delivering the information. One prominent NGO was regarded as sitting on the 43 44 information presented and failed to respond, a contention from the grassroots that is 45 heard widely. At other times, the risk is that sensitive information may be passed on to 46 47 the accused violator. For this activist, the distrust was related to how ethnicity confused 48 49 the clear distinction between duty bearer and rights holders because the two can ’can 50 become friends’ due to shared group affiliation. Whether in law enforcement, or, 52 otherwise, actors were described more generally as ‘…people, even in NGOs [that] are in 53 54 ethnic cocoons more than ever…’. Another allegedly ethnicised NGO includes one 55 56 prominent in the work on torture and EJE, where the respondent had been employed: 57 ‘[T]he directors of [ the national level NGO] also became complicit with the NARC regime 1 2 3 [political coalition that replaced Moi’s KANU regime], as some of their relatives were 4 5 working in government; they would sanction against extra-judicial killings or prison 6 reports that would expose the regime.’ 7 8 9 10 Another respondent (R2) spoke of attempts to pursue complaints against local police 11 involved in fabricating robbery, allegedly for their own gains. But upon approaching the 12 13 ombudsman who was from the same clan within the ethnic group as the accused were 14 15 from, the respondent was asked to drop the case immediately. There are surely many 16 other factors determining the strength of allegations, and therefore the grounds to 17 18 pursue a case. Nonetheless, it appears that ethnicity is very important in determining 19 20 whether an issue or case will be pursued. 21 22 23 Discussion 24 25 A fissure in perception and actions is very apparent. And though we don’t want to give 26 27 the impression of any absolute binary separation between ‘civil’ and ‘political’ society – 28 because activists clearly, as mentioned, at times overlap with civil society spaces and 29 30 resources, there is, nonetheless, undeniably, an exclusionary logic taking place. But even 31 32 when these harmful effects occur, does it necessarily imply that NGOs are inevitably 33 always ignoring or compromising grass roots activism? 34 35 36 37 Neocosmos (2007) maintains that NGOs and human rights can never truly exist in a 38 discrete space. He reasons that NGOs are institutionalised within states, and this renders 39 40 them deeply ambiguous in relation to power. This and related critiques of the 41 42 channelling of social change through institutional spaces prescribed and largely 43 44 controlled by the state, go to the heart of debates over tactics and terrains of struggle in 45 many African countries. As such they have special salience because many of the main 46 47 preoccupations of rights-based NGOs in South Africa, and increasingly in Kenya, for 48 49 example, has been to use institutional arenas, such as the policy and legal system to 50 secure rights. In terms of political opportunity and engagement by NGOs, Madlingozi 51 52 (2014) regards the importance of the scale at which an organisation works as having 53 54 significant bearing on their tactics. In other words, there is a clear distinction existing 55 between national and local levels. The national level organisations tend to be better 56 57 resourced and through elite connections are able to successfully harness the generous 17 34 51 1 2 3 civil and political spaces that exist in a country like South Africa. On the other hand, local 4 5 counter-hegemonic organisations struggle to mobilise resources and encounter 6 oppression and violations of their rights. 7 8 9 10 Arguably, more nuance might be provided to the debates by actual empirical 11 assessments and reflections on whether democratic space has been opened or closed 12 13 (Langford, 2015) by NGOs. Documenting actual outcomes and successful modalities - 14 15 such as alliances between local activists and professional actors- would ensure against 16 essentialising NGOs. In so doing, the benefits of being located outside institutional 18 spaces may be exaggerated and counterproductive to building robust democracies. 19 20 There is also evidence of how subaltern communities have worked in alliance with these 21 22 same professionals, for example, which may at times serve to sustain smaller 23 organisations and movements (see Madlingozi, 2014). Nonetheless, the evidence 24 25 presented here suggests that in Kenya the opening of democratic space and ‘civil society’ 26 27 has still to find its way to excluded spaces like Mathare. 28 29 30 Thus, how NGOs might even become complicit in managing and structuring dissent in 31 32 ways that do not challenge underlying power relations requires contextual empirical 33 analysis. Though we risk down playing many of the practical challenges and difficulties 35 that NGOs face in working with grass roots communities, by focusing upon activist 36 37 perceptions we have identified several tangible reasons for their exclusion from ‘civil 38 39 society’. NGOs are currently defending their political space from government attacks in 40 Kenya, and this also takes up time and resources. And there have been some successes, 41 42 so this assessment is by no means intended to be black and white. Without therefore 43 44 pointing fingers at NGOs as a whole, it is worth noting the structural deficiencies of civil 45 society in terms of the context of deep class, political and ethnic divisions. Donors and 46 47 others, therefore, should still address how funding contributes to the divides between 48 49 popular interests and elites described in the article. Though interventions may be 50 targeted at doing the ‘right’ thing, this should not divert attention from less obvious but 52 perhaps unexpected outcomes and effects. Certainly, we detect a ‘gap’ with civil society 53 54 at the grass roots level that under-develops concerted action. 17 54 1 2 3 Notwithstanding this, we are not necessarily arguing for purely autonomous space, or, 4 5 we believe, reification in any simple terms of ‘grass roots’ in binary opposition to ‘civil 6 society’. 7 8 9 10 Conclusion 11 How then are we representing this grassroots initiative and what theories of violence 12 13 are youth activists utilising? It is apparent from the mobilisation efforts in Mathare that 14 15 youth attempts to rearticulate EJEs and the violence surrounding them in a way that 16 brings the ‘everyday’ into focus – given that this is something that the activists as youth, 18 and many as male, have to encounter on a daily basis- is a necessary starting point for 19 20 framing and developing action. Without romanticising their efforts, it can be argued that 21 22 the activists’ frustrations with NGO work, and indeed their marginalisation, become a 23 powerful set of ‘shared symbols’ justifying their own efforts. Though action is 24 25 subsequently then also constrained or enabled by political opportunities and alliances -a 26 27 subject for further research- the articulation of their frustrations forms the impetus and 28 point of divergence at which the activists envision alternative ways of working from 29 30 NGOs. It is principally to their own actions, however, that they turn to for justice, 31 32 because as one activist (R1) shared: ‘only the people can defend this struggle’. 33 34 35 Bibliography 36 37 Auyero, J.
