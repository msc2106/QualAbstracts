ABSTRACT: 
This study sought to replicate and extend Hall and colleagues’ (2014) work on developing and validating scales from the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) to index the triarchic psychopathy constructs of boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. This study also extended Hall et al.’s initial findings by including the PPI Revised (PPI–R). A community sample (n D 240) weighted toward subclinical psychopathy traits and a male prison sample (n D 160) were used for this study. Results indicated that PPI–Boldness, PPI–Meanness, and PPI–Disinhibition converged with other psychopathy, personality, and behavioral criteria in ways conceptually expected from the perspective of the triarchic psychopathy model, including showing very strong convergent and discriminant validity with their Triarchic Psychopathy Measure counterparts. These findings further enhance the utility of the PPI and PPI–R in measuring these constructs.

DRISLANE31Research School of Psychology, The Australian National University2Department of Psychology, Eastern Kentucky University3Department of Psychology, Florida State UniversityThis study sought to replicate and extend Hall and colleagues’ (2014) work on developing and validating scales from the PsychopathicPersonality Inventory (PPI) to index the triarchic psychopathy constructs of boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. This study also extended Hallet al.’s initial findings by including the PPI Revised (PPI–R). A community sample (n D 240) weighted toward subclinical psychopathy traits anda male prison sample (n D 160) were used for this study. Results indicated that PPI–Boldness, PPI–Meanness, and PPI–Disinhibition convergedwith other psychopathy, personality, and behavioral criteria in ways conceptually expected from the perspective of the triarchic psychopathymodel, including showing very strong convergent and discriminant validity with their Triarchic Psychopathy Measure counterparts. Thesefindings further enhance the utility of the PPI and PPI–R in measuring these constructs.Psychopathy is a serious personality disorder marked by defi-cits in affective processing, interpersonal relations, and dys-functional behavior (Hare & Neumann, 2008). Patrick,Fowles, and Krueger (2009) proposed the triarchic model ofpsychopathy as a means of integrating persisting fundamentalthemes of current and historic conceptualizations and mea-surement modalities of the disorder. The triarchic model ofpsychopathy characterizes the disorder along three interrelatedyet distinctive phenotypic dimensional domains of boldness(social dominance, low stress reactivity, and thrill-adventureseeking), meanness (callousness, interpersonal detachment,exploitativeness), and disinhibition (impulsivity, poor self-regulation, low frustration tolerance; Patrick, Drislane, &Strickland, 2012). Empirical support has already begun toaccumulate for this model (e.g., Drislane, Patrick, & Arsal,2014; Patrick, 2010; Sellbom & Phillips, 2013).Patrick (2010) developed the Triarchic Psychopathy Mea-sure (TriPM) to directly assess the triarchic domains. Subse-quent to its release, several studies had reported evidencesupporting the convergent and discriminant validity of thethree scale scores in undergraduate (Drislane et al., 2014;Marion et al., 2013; Sellbom & Phillips, 2013), community(Anderson, Sellbom, Wygant, Salekin, & Krueger, in press;Strickland, Drislane, Lucy, Krueger, & Patrick, 2013), andcorrectional (Patrick, 2010; Sellbom & Phillips, 2013; Stan-ley, Wygant, & Sellbom, 2013) samples based on their abso-lute and relative associations with a broad range of otherpsychopathy measures and conceptually relevant personalitytraits.Patrick and colleagues (Drislane et al., in press; Hall et al.,2014; Patrick, 2010; Skeem, Polaschek, Patrick, & Lilienfeld,2011) have also advocated that the three triarchic domainscould be operationalized in various assessment instruments toallow for more expansive research. Although developed tocharacterize major themes discussed in the psychopathy litera-ture specifically, the triarchic model phenotypes are believedto reflect basic dispositional tendencies rooted in neurobiologythat underlie a range of psychopathology (e.g., other external-izing problems, disorders marked by dysfunction of the defen-sive motivational system, and other personality disorderscharacterized by deficient affiliation). As such, these traits arehypothesized to be embedded within a number of existingassessment instruments not originally developed to index thetriarchic model constructs.To date, published research has shown promising effortswith both the Youth Personality Traits Inventory (Drislaneet al., in press) and the Psychopathic Personality Inventory(PPI; Lilienfeld & Andrews, 1996; see also Hall et al., 2014).The PPI, and its revised version, the PPI–R, is a widelyresearched instrument for indexing psychopathy from adimensional trait approach. Hall et al. (2014) used a consen-sus-based rating approach to select items for inclusion in thePPI–Triarchic (PPI–Tri) scales. Initially, five doctoral studentsrated individual items from the 187-item PPI in relation totheir conceptual proximity to the triarchic domains. Initialitem selection was followed up by additional statistical refine-ment analyses to maximize internal consistency as well as rel-ative convergence and divergence for each item for theirtarget scales. Hall and colleagues further examined externalcorrelates of the PPI–Tri scales in undergraduate and forensicsamples, and the scales exhibited promising convergent anddiscriminant validity. More specifically, PPI–Boldness waspreferentially associated with TriPM Boldness; PsychopathyChecklist–Revised (PCL–R; Hare, 2003) scores reflectinginterpersonal deficits; and personality traits of social potency,stress immunity, and fearlessness. PPI–Meanness was primar-ily associated with TriPM Meanness; psychopathy criteriareflecting callousness egocentricity, affective detachment, andantisocial behavior; scores on antisocial personality disordermeasures; and personality traits indicating detachment,Received June 8, 2014; Revised August 24, 2014.Address correspondence to Martin Sellbom, Research School of Psychol-ogy, The Australian National University, Building 39, Canberra, ACT 0200,Australia; Email: martin.sellbom@anu.edu.au1Journal of Personality Assessment, 1–8, 2014Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLCISSN: 0022-3891 print / 1532-7752 onlineDOI: 10.1080/00223891.2014.962654Downloaded by [Florida State University] at 06:27 22 October 2014 aggression, and antagonism. Finally, PPI–Disinhibition waspreferentially related to psychopathy criteria centered onimpulsivity, sensation seeking, and antisocial lifestyle. ThisPPI scale was also meaningfully associated with a range ofmeasures indexing antisocial personality disorder, conductdisorder, aggression, alienation, and stress reactivity.The PPI–Tri scales pose a number of strengths relative tothe original PPI factor structure. Traditionally, investigatorshave evaluated the PPI and PPI–R in terms of two higher orderfactors, Fearless Dominance (FD; encompassing the SocialPotency, Stress Immunity, and Fearlessness subscales) andSelf-Centered Impulsivity (SCI; encompassing the CarefreeNonplanfulness, Impulsive Nonconformity, MachiavellianEgocentricity, and Blame Externalization subscales; Benning,Patrick, Hicks, Blonigen, & Krueger, 2003). The remainingPPI and PPI–R subscale, Coldheartedness, does not loadappreciably on either of the higher order factors, and is thuseither omitted from analyses or treated as a stand-alone scale.The stability of this factor structure has been criticized bysome (Neumann, Malterer, & Newman, 2008), and the role ofPPI–FD in the nomological network of psychopathy has beenthe focus of considerable debate in recent years (Lilienfeldet al., 2012; Miller & Lynam, 2012). The PPI–Tri scales, bycontrast, represent a reconfiguration of the PPI item set, usingonly those items deemed to be most central to the triarchicmodel constructs (i.e., omitting construct-irrelevant variancethat might be captured by remaining PPI items). Crucially, thePPI–Tri scales also better distinguish general externalizingproneness from callous aggressive tendencies through separateDisinhibition and Meanness scales, respectively. By combin-ing items from the Coldheartedness and Machiavellian Ego-centricity subscales (among other items), PPI–Tri Meannessmore fully captures the manipulative, antagonistic interper-sonal style characteristic of psychopathy than Coldheartednessalone; likewise, this reconfiguration allows for a purer mea-sure of disinhibitory proneness than PPI–SCI, by omitting var-iance in the Machiavellian Egocentricity subscale morerelevant to meanness. From a nosology standpoint, meannessand disinhibition are highlighted as important, separablesymptomatic components of both childhood conduct disorder(CD) and adult antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in themost recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manualof Mental Disorders (5th ed. [DSM–5]; American PsychiatricAssociation, 2013). Specifically, CD now includes a “limitedprosocial emotions” specifier indicative of callous-unemo-tional traits akin to the adult concept of meanness. In the alter-native dimensional system for assessing personality disordersin Section III of DSM–5, ASPD is characterized by traits spec-ified within the domains of antagonism (i.e., meanness) anddisinhibition. Further, the psychopathic traits specifier forASPD closely indexes the features assessed by PPI–Tri Bold-ness. Thus, the PPI–Tri scales allow for clearer evaluation ofdistinguishable traits highlighted in historic and contemporaryaccounts of psychopathy and codified in the DSM.This study sought to extend the validity research on the PPIand PPI–R Triarchic scales. As previously stated, the PPI andPPI–R are the most frequently used self-report instruments inpsychopathy research and are featured extensively in a largenumber of archival databases for which it would now be possi-ble to evaluate psychopathy from the perspective of the triar-chic model of psychopathy. Unlike the TriPM, which has notyet been used for clinical purposes, the PPI–R is normed andaccessible to clinicians for applied use. Thus, triarchic scalesfor the PPI–R would allow clinicians to incorporate this con-ceptualization of psychopathy into forensic and clinicalassessment of offenders and patients (e.g., risk assessment,treatment planning; Patrick et al., 2012). This study also offersimportant extensions of Hall et al. (2014) via the use of aprison sample and a community sample weighted for subclini-cal psychopathy traits as well as a range of additional externalcriteria conceptually relevant to the triarchic constructs (e.g.,fearlessness for Boldness, low empathy for Meanness, andantisocial behavior for Disinhibition). In addition, Hall et al.did not examine the validity of the PPI–R Triarchic scales, butdid provide item sets, so this is the first study to formally eval-uate these scales. The shaded portion of Table 1 includes anindication of hypothesized findings based on the constructvalidity research available on the triarchic scales more broadly(e.g., Drislane et al., 2014; Hall et al., 2014; Sellbom &Phillips, 2013; Stanley et al., 2013).METHODParticipants and ProceduresCommunity Sample. This sample consisted of 140 maleand 100 female community-dwelling individuals in centralAlabama who were recruited for subclinical psychopathictraits via advertisement for “adventurous, fearless, charming,and carefree people who’ve led exciting lives. Are you arethe kind of person who’d do almost anything for a dare? Areyou good at looking out for number one as well as handlingother people?” This method was based on previous researchsuccessfully using this form of recruitment (Belmore &Quinsey, 1994; DeMatteo, Heilbrun, & Marczyk, 2006;Raine, Lencz, Bihrle, LaCasse, & Colletti, 2000; Widom,1977; Widom & Newman, 1985). Individuals were adminis-tered the research battery individually by extensively traineddoctoral students, and were paid $75 for their participation.Participants were 55% White, 36% African American, and9% of other or mixed ethnicity. They had a mean age of 26.9(SD D 10.1), ranging from 18 to 75, and an average of 14.4(SD D 2.2) years of education. See Anderson et al. (in press)for more details about procedures and recruitment success fora subset of this sample.Prison Sample. This sample consisted of 160 maleinmates recruited from a medium-security prison in Kentucky.Study materials were administered individually by a trainedresearch assistant. The mean age of participants was 34.2 (SDD 9.6) with mean education of 11.9 years (SD D 1.2). Thesample was predominantly White (56%), with 40% identify-ing themselves as African American and the remaininginmates (4%) identifying themselves as coming from otherracial or ethnic groups. Sixty percent of the current samplewas incarcerated for violent offenses (including 22% of thetotal sample for homicide-related offenses), 24% for sexualoffenses, and 27% for drug-related offenses, among others.MeasuresPsychopathic Personality Inventory. Community partic-ipants were administered the PPI (Lilienfeld & Andrews,2 SELLBOM, WYGANT, DRISLANEDownloaded by [Florida State University] at 06:27 22 October 2014 1996; Lilienfeld & Widows, 2005), whereas the prison sam-ple was administered the PPI–R. The PPI and PPI–R are187- and 154-item self-report questionnaires designed toassess psychopathic personality traits. Both versions yieldone total score, three factor scores—Fearless-Dominance,Impulsive Antisociality (SCI on the PPI–R), and Coldheart-edness (based on one single subscale)—and scores from eightsubscales. In addition to fewer items, the PPI–R differs fromthe original version of the instrument in terms of (lower)reading level and omission of idiom-specific references.Thus, although the content of the items is largely the sameacross both versions, the specific wording varies for many ofthe items. Approximately 20% of the items are identicalacross the PPI and PPI–R, 45% of items differ by one or twowords, and 35% of items differ substantially in wording, butnot in meaning. This investigation focused on three scalesdesigned to index the triarchic constructs of Boldness, Mean-ness, and Disinhibition (Hall et al., 2014). PPI–Boldness ismade up of items from the Fearlessness, Social Potency, andStress Immunity subscales of the PPI; PPI–Meanness is com-posed of items from Coldheartedness, Machiavellian Egocen-tricity, and Fearlessness; and PPI–Disinhibition includesitems from the Carefree Nonplanfulness, Blame Externaliza-tion, Impulsive Nonconformity, Machiavellian Egocentricity,and Stress Immunity subscales of the PPI. In our study sam-ples, internal consistencies for these three scales were .71/.84(correctional/community) for Boldness, .77/.79 for Meanness,and .76/.74 for Disinhibition.Table 1.—Zero-order correlations and multiple regression analyses for the PPI Triarchic Scales.PPI–Boldness PPI–Meanness PPI–Disinhibitionr/b r/b r/b Multiple R2Triarchic Psychopathy MeasureBoldnessa .77/.76 .20/.13 .01/.01 .62Boldnessb .62*/.59 .09/12 –.21*/–.15 .41Meannessa .15/.10 .74/.65 .47/.25 .61Meannessb .10/.14 .72/.63 .44/.27 .58Disinhibitiona –.01/.01 .43/.20 .72/.64 .55Disinhibitionb –.10/.01 .29/.10 .62/.59 .40Personality Inventory for DSM—5Negative Affectivitya –.24/–.23 .00/–.10 .40/.44 .23Negative Affectivityb –.20/–.09 –.05/–.23 .51/.57 .32Detachmenta –.18/–.25 .38/.34 .37/.26 .27Detachmentb –.29/–.23 .21/.10 .43/.36 .25Antagonisma .32/.23 .59/.46 .42/.26 .46Antagonismb .19/.23 .53/.41 .43/.34 .41Disinhibitiona .29/.26 .36/.12 .64/.60 .50Disinhibitionb –.21*/–.08 .32/.08 .80*/.76 .65Psychoticisma .10/.07 .25/.11 .41/.37 .19Psychoticismb –.07/.04 .14/–.06 .59/.61 .35Interpersonal Reactivity IndexPerspective Takinga .12/.15 –.52/–.46 –.38/–.20 .34Fantasya –.09/–.06 –.23/–.26 .00/.09 .07Empathic Concerna .04/.10 –.67/–.69 –.23/.02 .46Personal Distressa –.52/–.48 –.17/–.23 .24/.30 .36Fear Questionnairea –.40/–.39 –.11/–.08 .01/.02 .17Antisocial Behavior Questionnairea .24/.24 .27/.15 .31/.27 .18LSRP Totala .05/.02 .64/.50 .56/.38 .53Egocentricitya .17/.13 .58/.49 .37/.20 .38Callousa –.04/–.08 .53/.48 .35/.17 .32Antisociala –.09/–.07 .33/.14 .60/.55 .38Lifetime alcohol use historya .19/.21 .13/.00 .28/.29 .12Lifetime marijuana use historya .19/.20 .13/.00 .29/.31 .13Lifetime illicit drug use historya .11/.13 .04/–.07 .23/.27 .07SCID–IIcAntisociala .14/1.30 .22/1.19 .27/1.46 .04Antisocialb .10/1.06 .35/1.14 .34/1.12 .05Narcissistica .16/1.18 .32/1.47 .16/1.10 .04PCL–R Totalb .21/.25 .26/.17 .27/.27 .17Factor 1 (Interpersonal/Affective)b .30/.31 .20/.16 .08/.09 .13Factor 2 (Social Deviance)b .11/.17 .26/.15 .36/.34 .18Facet 1 (Interpersonal)b .36/.37 .11/.08 .02/.06 .14Facet 2 (Affective) b .12/13 .22/.19 .12/.09 .07Facet 3 (Lifestyle) b .13/.20 .18/.06 .38/.40 .19Facet 4 (Antisocial)b .06/.09 .26/.20 .24/.19 .10Note.

The TriPM (Patrick,2010) is a 58-item self-report inventory of psychopathy thatwas administered in both samples. Although a total score canbe computed for the TriPM, the primary focus of the inventoryis on assessing psychopathy in terms of three distinguishable,albeit modestly correlated, dimensions of psychopathy: Bold-ness, Meanness, and Disinhibition. Patrick (2010) provideddata regarding the differential correlates of these scales. TheTriPM has exhibited good construct validity in both university(Drislane et al., 2014; Sellbom & Phillips, 2013) andcorrectional (Sellbom & Phillips, 2013; Stanley et al., 2013)samples. Each of the three scales met the cutoff for acceptableinternal consistencies (as D .76–.88) across both samples.Personality Inventory for DSM–5. The PersonalityInventory for DSM–5 (PID–5; Krueger, Derringer, Markon,Watson, & Skodol, 2012) is a 220-item self-report inventorydeveloped to index the five DSM–5 Section III personalitydomains and their respective facets. It was administered inboth samples. The factor structure and other external constructvalidity evidence for this measure has been documented innumerous studies (e.g., Anderson et al., 2013; Hopwood,Thomas, Markon, Wright, & Krueger, 2012; Sellbom, Ander-son, & Bagby, 2013; Thomas et al., 2013). We used the PID–5 domain scores in this study; internal consistencies in ourstudy samples (Cronbach’s alpha) ranged from .89 (Disinhibi-tion in the prison sample) to .95 (Psychoticism in the commu-nity sample).Psychopathy Checklist–Revised. The PCL–R (Hare,2003) is a 20-item clinician rating scale for psychopathy. ThePCL–R includes a semistructured clinical interview andreview of the participant’s institutional record. Following theinterview and file review, the researcher rates each participanton a scale of 0 (not present), 1 (maybe, or occasionally, pres-ent), and 2 (definitely present) for each item, yielding a possi-ble range of scores of 0 to 40. Previous research studies havereported excellent interrater reliabilities of greater than .90 forthe PCL–R (Hare, 2003). Twelve percent of the sample wasindependently rated by two graduate research assistants to cal-culate interrater reliability. The reliability for the Total scoreof the PCL–R was good (intra-class correlation [ICC] D .93).In addition to a Total score, the PCL–R yields two factorscores, Factor 1 (Affective/Interpersonal) and Factor 2 (SocialDeviance), and four facets, 1 (interpersonal), 2 (affective), 3(lifestyle), and 4 (antisocial). The PCL–R was only adminis-tered in the prison sample. The first and second authors, bothlicensed clinical psychologists with specialized training inpsychopathy assessment (e.g., completed Darkstone ResearchGroup training on the PCL–R), provided direct clinical super-vision for all PCL–R ratings, which were completed by trainedgraduate research assistants. Graduate research assistants alsocompleted formal PCL–R training via various workshops.Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–IV Axis IIDisorders. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM–IVAxis II Disorders (SCID–II; First, Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams,& Benjamin, 1997) is a structured interview commonly usedto reliably assess DSM–IV personality disorder criteria. Avail-able data indicate good interrater reliability for ASPD and nar-cissistic personality disorder (NPD) with this instrument withICC ranging from .80 (Lobbestael, Leurgans, & Arntz, 2011)to .98 (Maffei et al., 1997). This study used the SCID–II ques-tions as a dimensional symptom count ranging from 0 to 8 forASPD (the seven adult criteria and evidence of conduct disor-der prior to age 15) in both samples and 0 to 9 for NPD in thecommunity sample only.Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale. The LevensonSelf-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP; Levenson, Kiehl, &Fitzpatrick, 1995) is a 26-item self-report measure designed toassess the defining personality and behavioral features of psy-chopathy. It was administered in the community sample.Recent work has shown evidence for a three-factor modelreflecting egocentricity, callous, and antisocial proclivities(e.g., Sellbom, 2011). Internal consistencies ranged from .70(Callous and Antisocial) to .83 (Egocentricity) in the currentsample.Antisocial Behavior Questionnaire. The AntisocialBehavior Questionnaire (ABQ; Sellbom & Verona, 2004;Wall, Sellbom, & Goodwin, 2013) is a 16-item self-reportinventory inspired by other questionnaires to reliably assessdelinquency and antisocial conduct in juveniles and collegestudents, respectively (Hirschi, Hindelang, & Weis, 1980;Lynam, Whiteside, & Jones, 1999). Our version lists 16behaviors that would be considered “criminal” in nature,including theft, assault, vandalism, drunk driving, fraud, drug-related offenses, and domestic violence. Participants respondas to whether they had acted in the manner described in eachquestion on a scale of three response options: 1 (no), 2 (yes,but only once), and 3 (yes, more than once). The ABQ hasbeen found to correlate with the PPI Total (r D .49–.63) andPPI Impulsive-Antisociality (r D .52–.69) scores (Sellbom &Verona, 2004; Sellbom et al., 2012; Wall et al., 2013). Inter-nal consistency in this study was .84; it was only administeredin the community sample.The Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The InterpersonalReactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1983) is a 28-item measure ofdispositional empathy that has been used in previous psychop-athy research (e.g., Alterman, McDermott, Cacciola, & Ruth-erford, 2003; Stanley et al., 2013). It consists of four separate,seven-item scales that tap particular facets of empathy(empathic concern, personal distress, perspective taking, andfantasy [imaginative transposition of feelings onto fictionalothers]). Internal consistencies in this study ranged from .70(Fantasy) to .75 (Perspective Taking). It was only adminis-tered in the community sample.Fear Questionnaire. The Fear Questionnaire (FQ; Marks& Mathews, 1979) asks participants to rate 15 situations (e.g.,“Going into crowded shops,” “Large open spaces,” or “Sightof blood”) on a scale ranging from 0 (would not avoid it) to 8(always avoid it). These ratings are used to generate scores onthree subscales: Social Phobia, Agoraphobia, and Blood/Injury Phobia; a total score indicating general fearfulness wasused in this study. The structure of the FQ as well as its con-vergent and discriminant validity in differentiating varioussymptoms of anxiety disorders has been established (e.g., Oei,Moylan, & Evans, 1991). Internal consistency in this study for4 SELLBOM, WYGANT, DRISLANEDownloaded by [Florida State University] at 06:27 22 October 2014 the FQ Total score was .85. It was only administered in thecommunity sample.Background Interview. Each of the participants in thecommunity sample completed an extensive interview focusingon various psychosocial background variables, including ques-tions about education, employment, medical history, mentalhealth, substance use, and legal history. For this study, wefocused on lifetime ratings of alcohol and drug use based on arating scale from 0 (no use) to 4 (definitely abuse). Alcoholand marijuana use were utilized as separate scores, whereasillicit drug use (cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, etc.) wereaveraged into a composite score.RESULTSWe first calculated intercorrelations between the PPI–Triscales. These were .09 (community) and .03 (prison) for PPI–Boldness and PPI–Meanness; –.05 (community) and –.17(prison) for PPI–Boldness and PPI–Disinhibition; and .35(community) and .32 (prison) for PPI–Meanness and PPI–Dis-inhibition. These are very similar to those reported in Hallet al.’s (2014) forensic and student samples.For external criterion analyses, we estimated zero-ordercorrelations between PPI–Triarchic scales and external criteriain both samples. Moreover, to further elucidate the relativeand unique correlates for each PPI–Triarchic scale, weregressed each of the external criteria onto the three PPI scalescores. These models were estimated via ordinary leastsquares for all criteria, except the SCID symptom counts forwhich negative binomial models were used. For the formermodels, all criterion variables met standards for normal distri-bution and homoscedasticity, whereas the count distributionswere best estimated via a negative binomial model becausethe variances were overdispersed relative to the means.Because of the large number of external criteria for each PPI–Triarchic scale and thus to control for family-wise error, weused Bonferroni-corrected alphas of .002 (.05/23 criteria) inthe community sample and .003 (.05/16 criteria) in the prisonsample. Table 1 shows all correlation and standardized regres-sion coefficients for each model.PPI–BoldnessAs expected, PPI–Boldness evinced a large effect size asso-ciation with TriPM Boldness in both samples, and was weaklyto uncorrelated with the other TriPM scales, which is consis-tent with the findings of Hall et al. (2014). The correlationbetween PPI–Boldness and TriPM Boldness was stronger inthe community sample than the prison sample (Fisher’s z D2.87, p D .004). In terms of other psychopathy criteria, PPI–Boldness was associated with the largest effect size in termsof predicting PCL–R Factor 1 and Facet 1 capturing the coreinterpersonal and social dominance qualities of the disorder.This PPI scale was not significantly associated with any of theLSRP scales, as expected, given the latter’s lack of coverageof this psychopathy domain (see Drislane et al., 2014; Sell-bom & Phillips, 2013). With regard to personality traits, PPI–Boldness scores were moderately associated with low negativeaffectivity and low detachment, but also had significant asso-ciations with high antagonism and disinhibition, especially inthe community sample (Fisher’s z D 4.97, p < .001 for PID–5Disinhibition). Whereas the former are consistent withprevious research, the latter are likely a reflection of specificassociations with risk taking (Disinhibition) and grandiosity(Antagonism), which are common correlates of this psychopa-thy construct (Anderson et al., in press; Sellbom & Phillips,2013; Strickland et al., 2013). Interestingly, PID–5 Antago-nism was uniquely predicted by all three of the PPI–Triarchicscales (albeit most strongly by PPI–Meanness), whichsupports some scholars’ contention that antagonism is a corecomponent of psychopathy (see, e.g., Lynam & Derefinko,2006). Furthermore, PPI–Boldness was associated with thelargest effect size in terms of predicting low scores on the FQand IRI Personal Distress, which indicates low emotional reac-tivity reflected in this psychopathy domain (Stanley et al.,2013). Finally, PPI–Boldness was also significantly anduniquely associated with antisocial behavior, as well as alco-hol and marijuana use in the community sample.PPI–MeannessThe PPI–Meanness scale was strongly associated withTriPM Meanness, and to a lesser degree, TriPM Disinhibitionin both samples; this was consistent with Hall et al.’s (2014)findings. In addition, and consistent with previous triarchicpsychopathy research (Drislane et al., 2014; Sellbom & Phil-lips, 2013), PPI–Meanness was associated with the largesteffect size prediction of the LSRP Egocentricity and Callousscales. Moreover, this PPI Triarchic scale was also associatedwith PCL–R Total, Factor 2, and Facet 4 scores at the zero-order level. Surprisingly, although associated with the largestcorrelation and standardized beta weight in the prediction ofPCL–R Facet 2 (Affective), as expected and consistent withHall et al.’s findings, these did not reach statistical signifi-cance (p D .02) at our conservative alpha level. In terms ofpersonality correlates, PPI–Meanness was most strongly asso-ciated with PID–5 Antagonism relative to the other PPI–Triscales, as consistent with previous work with the TriPM(Anderson et al., in press; Strickland et al., 2013), but alsoDetachment in the community sample, which is consistentwith meanness as a reflection of agentic disaffiliation (Patricket al., 2009). This PPI Triarchic scale was also the best predic-tor of three of the four IRI subscales directly reflecting defi-cient empathic functioning, which is a core feature of themeanness construct (Patrick et al., 2009). Finally, PPI–Mean-ness was the only significant predictor of NPD criterion countsas well as contributed uniquely to the prediction of ASPD inthe community sample. In terms of discriminant validity, PPI–Meanness had moderate zero-order correlations with variousindicators of disinhibitory traits (LSRP Antisocial, PID–5 Dis-inhibition), but these became nonsignificant in the regressionanalyses where PPI–Disinhibition was also a predictor.PPI–DisinhibitionAs expected, the PPI–Disinhibition scale was associatedwith the largest effect size in predicting the TriPM Disinhibi-tion scale, and contributed to a small degree to the predictionof TriPM Meanness, which is consistent with previous find-ings (Hall et al., 2014). Scores on PPI–Disinhibition were alsomodestly inversely correlated with TriPM Boldness in theprison, but not community, sample (Fisher’s z D 2.17, p DPSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY TRIARCHIC SCALES 5Downloaded by [Florida State University] at 06:27 22 October 2014 .03). In terms of PCL–R scores, it had moderate correlationswith Factor 2 and Facet 3, which is also consistent with beingmost strongly associated with the LSRP Antisocial facet scale.From a personality perspective, PPI–Disinhibition showedlarge correlations with PID–5 Disinhibition, but also contrib-uted uniquely to the prediction of all five PID–5 domains inthe regression analyses (see also Strickland et al., 2013). Themagnitude of the correlation between PPI–Disinhibition andPID–5 Disinhibition was stronger in the prison than commu-nity sample (Fisher’s z D –3.31, p < .001). In addition, posi-tive correlations between PPI–Disinhibition and PID–5Negative Affectivity, Psychoticism, and Detachment werealso observed. Furthermore, consistent with previous researchon Triarchic disinhibition (Hall et al., 2014; Sellbom & Phil-lips, 2013), this PPI Triarchic scale was significantly anduniquely associated with various predictors of antisocialityand substance use in both community and prison samples.DISCUSSIONThis study replicates and extends Hall and colleagues’(2014) promising work on developing PPI and PPI–R Triar-chic scales, and extends the validity of these scales to thosescored on the PPI–R. The results reported here indicatepromising construct validity for the these PPI-based scales astheir convergent and discriminant associations mirror those ofboth previous work (Hall et al., 2014) and those reported withother triarchic measures, including the TriPM (e.g., Drislaneet al., 2014; Sellbom & Phillips, 2013; Stanley et al., 2013).Some specific findings warrant further discussion. Althoughthe association between boldness and substance use is a rela-tively novel finding (but see Hicks, Iacono, & McGue, 2014;Hicks et al., 2013), as these are typically most strongly associ-ated with disinhibition (Krueger, Markon, Patrick, Benning, &Kramer, 2007), this adds to the literature indicating that thispsychopathy construct is associated with maladaptivebehaviors in addition to adaptive functioning (cf. Miller &Lynam, 2012). Indeed, this community sample exhibited agreater range of boldness variance, perhaps because of therecruitment strategy employed, as opposed to samples with agreater range and level of disinhibition (e.g., criminalsamples).In terms of unexpected findings, most surprising was thelarge association with PID–5 Psychoticism; however, Eysenck(e.g., Eysenck & Eysenck, 1976) frequently argued that disin-hibition and psychosis fell on the same continuum, with theformer indicating a progression toward the latter. Anotherpossible explanation is that psychoticism includes significantgeneral maladjustment variance in addition to schizotypy(Hopwood et al., 2012). Moderate associations with PID–5Negative Affectivity and Detachment, albeit not conceptuallyindicated, are nonetheless consistent with previous research(Strickland et al., 2013).ImplicationsDespite very different samples (community members vs.male prisoners), the pattern of associations with criterionmeasures was highly consistent for triarchic scales developedfrom the PPI and PPI–R. This provides strong support that thePPI–R–Tri scales measure the constructs of the triarchicmodel in largely the same way as the original PPI–Tri scalesdeveloped by Hall and colleagues (2014). These findings areimportant, as they further demonstrate the utility of the PPIand PPI–R in capturing these psychopathy constructs andallows for a broader examination of the triarchic model ofpsychopathy given the extensive range of studies that haveemployed the PPI and PPI–R in a variety of psychopathyresearch focused on neuroscience, behavioral correlates, andapplied settings (e.g., forensic, correctional; see, e.g., Sellbom,Lilienfeld, Fowler, & McCrary, in press, for a review).Additionally, because the PPI–Tri scales measure psycho-pathic tendencies in trait-dimensional terms without referenceto antisocial behavior, they could be used in future investiga-tions evaluating crime prediction avoiding the potential issueof criterion contamination that is sometimes raised for studiesusing the PCL–R (Cooke, Michie, Hart, & Clark, 2004). Fur-thermore, these findings further indicate that a realignment ofthe PPI and PPI–R items to reflect the triarchic constructs pro-vide for more distinct measurement and separation of theimportant meanness construct, which many scholars wouldcontend represents the core trait domain of psychopathy inboth childhood (i.e., callous-unemotional traits; e.g., Barryet al., 2000) and adulthood (e.g., antagonism; see Derefinko &Lynam, 2013).Findings of this study are also consistent with an under-lying goal of the triarchic model, which is to link the phe-notypic components of psychopathy to broader models ofpersonality and psychopathology (Patrick et al., 2009).Indeed, PPI–Meanness was strongly associated with symp-toms of NPD and ASPD (along with PPI–Disinhibition),suggesting that antagonistic personality traits represent acommon liability underlying Cluster B personality disor-ders (Kernberg, 1989). Critically, however, this study alsoreplicates important findings that boldness distinguishespsychopathy from related disorders, as scores on PPI–Boldness predicted unique variance in Factor 1 and Facet1 of the PCL–R, but not symptoms of ASPD (Venables,Hall, & Patrick, 2014; Wall, Wygant, & Sellbom, in press).Likewise, this study is consistent with previous reports dem-onstrating that the LSRP measures psychopathy somewhat dif-ferently than the PCL–R, as it does not contain variancerelated to boldness (Drislane et al., 2014; Sellbom & Phillips,2013). Thus, scores on the LSRP might be more reflective ofgeneral externalizing or antisocial tendencies than primarypsychopathy, which also emphasizes social dominanceembodied by boldness.Limitations and Future DirectionsDespite these important implications, our findings must beconsidered in light of some limitations. The prison samplesize was relatively small, especially given our conservativealpha level, and only consisted of male inmates; future workneeds to replicate these findings in a female inmate sample.We also did not have access to interrater reliability informa-tion for the SCID–II in either sample or the background inter-view in the community sample; as such, we do not know thedegree to which those results are attenuated due tomeasurement error. Nevertheless, the pattern of findings isconsistent with both conceptual expectations and previousempirical work.6 SELLBOM, WYGANT, DRISLANEDownloaded by [Florida State University] at 06:27 22 October 2014 In addition to replicating the initial work on the PPI Triar-chic scales (Hall et al., 2014), the findings reported here are inline with recent research aimed at elucidating the triarchicmodel of psychopathy in existing assessment instruments(e.g., Drislane et al., in press). Future work should continue toexplore this approach with other omnibus personality invento-ries, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven-tory–2–RF (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008), which also exhibitsubstantial clinical utility, thus bridging psychopathologyresearch and clinical assessment.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWewould like to thank Jaime Anderson, Kathryn Applegate,Adam Crighton, Brandee Goodwin, Cody Ison, Jessica Jacobs,Alexandria Johnson, Rebecca Kastner, Jade Petty, RachelRock, Jennifer Stanley, Katara West, Courtney Welsh, andChristopher Wiggins for their assistance in data collection.
