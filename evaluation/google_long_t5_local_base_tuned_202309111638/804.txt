ABSTRACT: 
The official result of Lesotho's general election of 1998, which saw a 79 out of 80 seat victory for the ruling Lesotho Congress of Democrats (LCD), was repudiated by the opposition, notably the former ruling Basotho National Party (BNP) and the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP). These latter parties were historic enemies but forged an alliance of convenience to contest the outcome of the election. By mobilising their supporters to occupy Maseru they successfully paralysed the capacity of the LCD to govern. After diplomatic preliminaries, this led to military intervention by South Africa and Botswana in September 1998 and their brokering of an agreement which restored the LCD to power, on the condition that a new election would be held within eighteen months, with the rules for that contest being discussed between the parties in the interim. That election has now been scheduled for April 2000. The article reviews the conduct and result of the general election of 1998. It concludes that the opposition's objections were largely spurious, but notes that the unbalanced nature of the LCD's victory – a product of the first-past-the-post electoral system – was a major cause of the wider crisis. It therefore proposes that any lasting settlement of political differences in Lesotho is going to require a new electoral system which will allow for a more inclusive outcome.

That election has now been scheduled for April 2000.The article reviews the conduct and result of the general election of 1998.It concludes that the opposition’s objections were largely spurious, but notesthat the unbalanced nature of the LCD’s victory – a product of the first-past-the-post electoral system – was a major cause of the wider crisis. It thereforeproposes that any lasting settlement of political differences in Lesotho is go-ing to require a new electoral system which will allow for a more inclusiveoutcome.introductionThe repudiation of election outcomes by losing parties in Africa isnothing new. In fact, it is almost standard, even if following elections– once they have gone through the motions of staging protests orappealing to High Courts (usually unsuccessfully) to overturn theelectoral results – opposition parties normally buckle down, accepttheir lot and hope for better times to come. However, in the case ofLesotho’s general election of May 1998, which saw an overwhelmingvictory by the ruling party, the rejection of the result by the oppositionparties resulted in a major and extended crisis which by September had* Professor of Political Studies, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa. Associate Professor of Geography, Rhodes University.

This served to restore the LCD to authority, butonly at the expense of extensive rioting, pillaging and arson of thecapital, Maseru, as well as smaller towns, by the opposition, somescores of deaths and injuries of Basotho, and massive damage to theeconomy and its prospects. Inevitably, the legality, wisdom andcompetence of the South African led intervention were the subject ofenormous controversy, not only within Lesotho but also (notably) inSouth Africa, as well as in other SADC countries and indeed,internationally. But the upshot was, that, after extended negotiations,the immediate crisis was defused by a compromise which, alongside therestoration of the LCD to office, saw the creation in November 1998 ofa twenty-four-person Independent Political Authority (IPA), com-posed of two members of all political parties which had participated inthe election. This was charged with preparing for new elections withinthe next fifteen to eighteen months by inter alia considering measures for‘ levelling the playing field’ for all parties and persons wanting toparticipate in the next contest, reviewing the appropriateness of theelectoral system with a view to making it more representative, andreviewing the structure and function of the Independent ElectoralCommission (IEC) (Southall 1998a).In the event, the outcome of this (SADC coerced) compromiseremains uncertain. The LCD – which according to the official results ofthe May 1998 election won 79 out of the 80 seats – continues to feel thatit was robbed of the fruits of victory by cantankerous and un-representative opposition parties which were unable to stomach theverdict of democracy. Consequently, it has extended only ratherminimal cooperation to the IPA, which for a variety of reasons(including but extending well beyond minimal cooperation from theLCD) has made extremely limited progress towards its goal of‘ levelling the electoral playing field’. None the less, it has recently beenannounced that Lesotho is heading for new elections presentlyscheduled for 8 April 2000 – even though (at time of writing in July1999) it has as yet failed to reach consensus on the nature of theelectoral system on which a repeat consensus should be held, or uponwhat should be done with the IEC. Consequently, whether or not newelections will be held within the projected time scale remains in doubt.The roots of conflict in Lesotho run very deep, so deep that it seemsinherently unlikely that new elections will resolve what is, in essence, anlesotho ’s general election of 1998 671extended crisis of existence faced by a country which, but for thevagaries of history, would long ago have been incorporated into SouthAfrica (Southall 1998b). Consequently, if Lesotho is to be enabled toenjoy the developmental benefits which many had hoped would accrueto it following the demise of apartheid and the arrival of democracy inSouth Africa next door, we need not only a carefully craftedunderstanding of the historical divisions which have rendered the statedysfunctional, but also a careful analysis of the present political impasseand the putting in place of peace-building strategies which couldprovide for progressive momentum towards the construction of astable, more open and more democratic society. This is a dauntingagenda for all the political players – government, opposition, civilsociety, SADC and the wider international community – which areinvolved in attempting to resolve the present crisis. None the less, for allthat there are no easy solutions, it seems that the holding of newelections in Lesotho is a necessary if not sufficient condition for futuredevelopment and peace. And, of course, given the highly contestedresult of the May 1998 election, new elections will need to be heldunder conditions of such freedom and fairness that their outcomecannot be reasonably disputed by the losers. We believe, as do mostobservers and all the opposition parties, that this requires a change inthe electoral system, away from the present straightforward West-minster style, first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, to a more inclusivesystem which would, at the very least, incorporate some element ofproportional representation. But we also believe that it is importantthat such an election be conducted upon the understanding that it isbeing held, not because the result of the  election was rigged (as was allegedby the opposition) but because the outcome was unbalanced, unrepresentative andinappropriate for the development of democracy in Lesotho.In the light of the above, the purpose of this article is a very limitedone. It is simply to demonstrate that the case of the opposition, that theLCD stole its way back into power in 1998, is fundamentally flawed.We will argue below that, although there are some grounds forsuggesting that there may have been some tampering with mechanics ofthe election, the LCD won what would, in other contexts, be regardedas an indisputable victory.The importance of this task is as follows. First, although aCommission (under South African Justice Pius Langa) appointed bySADC to enquire into the election subsequently offered something ofan endorsement of the result, that endorsement was unnecessarily mildand lukewarm. In short, we argue that the Langa Commission Report672 roger southall and roddy foxwas a fudge that signally failed to address the logic of the evidence. Ineffect, the Commission’s Report left unfair question marks standingagainst the LCD’s victory. Second, we believe that unless Lesotho iswracked by unpredictable upheavals which seriously alter the politicallandscape (such as a split in the LCD) before the next election, thedemographic data is such that the ruling party is again headed for amajor victory at the next poll, under whatever system that is conducted.In other words, for all that we recognise that the LCD enjoys theadvantages which incumbency bestows, we argue that, for the moment,the ruling party enjoys a natural majority amongst the country’selectorate. In consequence, whilst it could be that the opposition willbe able to point to flaws in the forthcoming electoral process, they willhave to put up a comprehensive case if they are to convince the outsideworld that, once again, they have been ‘robbed’.In other words, this paper has more than an academic purpose inthat it is also designed to assist assessment of the legitimacy of theforthcoming electoral contest in Lesotho, whenever that may be."the immediate background to the election of 1988The proximate cause of the present crisis in Lesotho is the nature of thevictory won by the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) in the generalelection of March 1993, when it won all 65 seats up for grabs with some74–7 per cent of the popular vote. Although the outcome wasunanimously endorsed by international observer organisations, thedefeated Basotho National Party (BNP), which had won no seats but22–6 per cent of the vote, bitterly rejected the result, arguing that it hadbeen ‘robotically ’ engineered, but had its objections repudiated by theHigh Court (Sekatle 1995).It will be recalled that the BNP had ruled the country sinceindependence in 1966, having won the first general election held in1965 by 31 seats (and 41–63 per cent of the vote), against the BCP’s 25seats and 39–7 per cent of the poll, and 4 seats and 16–5 per cent of thevote for the royalist Marema Freedom Party. This result had come as amajor setback to the BCP – led by Ntsu Mokhehle – which had beenformed in the mid-fifties as the principal vehicle of anti-colonialnationalism and of an emergent middle-class interest. However, backedby conservative interests (notably the lesser chiefs and the influentialRoman Catholic church), the BNP won its narrow victory (in partbecause of the absence from Lesotho of those workers who hadmigrated for employment in the South African mines on polling day)lesotho ’s general election of 1998 673and assumed office under the leadership of Chief Leabua Jonathan,who thereupon attempted to secure his party’s position by collaboratingclosely with the apartheid regime. The costs of this strategy, combinedwith internal difficulties faced by the government in face of conflictswith an ambitious monarchy and a civil service whose senior positionswere staffed by supporters of the opposition, led to the defeat of theBNP when it again faced the electorate in 1970. Retrospective analysisdemonstrated that the BNP had obtained only 23 seats and 41–6 percent of the vote against 36 seats and 49–8 per cent of the vote securedby the BCP. But these results were never announced, for when it hadbecome clear that the BNP was losing, Jonathan had suspended theelection and sought to establish a BNP-led national coalition. This wasrejected by the most radical elements of the BCP, which went on toattempt a coup in 1974. When this failed, the leading elements of theparty fled into exile, leaving only a rump domestic leadership behindthem (Ajulu 1995).During the years that followed, the BNP gradually secured itscontrol over the state, notably by expelling opposition supporters fromthe public service, and infiltrating its own devotees into the securityservices. Importantly, too, Jonathan sought to shore up his govern-ment’s standing by moving towards a rhetorically radical, anti-apartheid posture, which combined the benefits of securing keysegments of support domestically as well as increasing internationalsupport and an associated flow of foreign aid. In addition, whilst theBCP was flirting with the South African Pan-Africanist Congress(PAC) in exile, the BNP was moving into a de facto connection with theAfrican National Congress as, particularly after the Soweto revolt of1976, students and refugees crossed over the border looking for refugeand}or movement on to third countries. However, as the BNP adoptedan increasingly radical posture, so it offended conservative elementswithin its own coalition of support (notably when it establisheddiplomatic relations with the USSR and other communist countries)and ran into conflict with the South African government, which by theearly 1980s was itself attempting to impose its will upon neighbouringcountries via its ‘ total strategy’ involving military raids and politicaldestabilisation. This was to culminate in a military coup, in January1986, led by Major-General Justin Lekhanya (but backed by the king),whose displacement of a government which had become increasingdictatorial and brutal domestically was initially greeted with popularenthusiasm. But, in turn, the military government soon provedinefficient and flagrantly corrupt. It lost a major prop when it fell out674 roger southall and roddy foxwith the king (Moshoeshoe), removing him from the throne inNovember 1990 and replacing him with his son, Letsie (who was areluctant monarch). But more importantly, it was unable to withstandboth internal and external pressures for democratisation whichdeveloped enormously after the onset of the transition process in SouthAfrica in early 1990. This then set the background for the return of theBCP leadership from exile, and its mobilisation of popular supportduring the lead up to the general election of 1993. This latter momentprovided the opportunity for the BCP to reap its historical record notonly as the party of liberation, but as the winner of 1970. And, not least,the 1993 election provided the opportunity for the electorate to exactits revenge upon the BNP for the years of dictatorship. Hence there wasa fundamental shift in popular support towards the BCP, whose owncollaborative connection with the apartheid regime (which had backedits Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA) during the early 1980s) was largelyoverlooked by voters overwhelmingly concerned with matters anddilemmas domestic (Southall 1995).Although Lesotho’s return to civilian rule was at one with the waveof democracy then sweeping the sub-region, the BCP’s assumption ofpower met with considerable resistance. Fears of the BNP and elementsof the army that the BCP was intending to rebuild its LLA precipitateda rebellion by lower ranks in November 1993 which saw four seniorofficers (alleged to be abetting the LLA) forced to resign. This wasfollowed by the resignation of the army’s commander, whilst hisreplacement, Major-General O. T. Metsing, was almost immediatelycompelled to relay a demand for a 100 per cent wage increase to thegovernment. When this was rejected, there was discussion abouttoppling the government, but when differences emerged about whetherthis should be by the BNP or by a new military regime, fighting brokeout between two factions stationed at Makoanyane and Ratjomosebarracks in Maseru. With the government powerless to intervene, arelative tranquillity was only restored after nearly two weeks bymediators from the Organisation of African Unity, the Commonwealthand eventually the ‘ four presidents ’, of Botswana, Zimbabwe and DeKlerk of South Africa and Mandela of the ANC (Matlosa 1995).Mokhehle conceded a 66 per cent pay rise to the military to securea settlement, but rumours that the government was preparing torestructure the security forces (whose personnel were still over-whelmingly inclined towards the BNP) gained ground following theannouncement in June 1994 of a Commission of Inquiry into theDefence Force. This was followed by announcement of a furtherlesotho ’s general election of 1998 675Commission to enquire into the events surrounding the removal of theformer king whose terms of reference were deemed deeply threateningto the royal family. The outcome was a monarchical coup on 15 August1994, when Letsie – urged on by the BNP and assured of the supportof the army – pronounced the dissolution of the government and hisassumption of executive of power preparatory to the formation of agovernment of national unity which would be charged with holding afresh election. But the coup met with widespread popular oppositionand regional determination that it should not succeed. Diplomaticpressures by newly democratic South Africa and the governments ofBotswana and Zimbabwe eventually restored the BCP government topower on 14 September 1996, in exchange for abandonment of theinquiry into the monarchy. In addition, it was agreed that Moshoeshoewould re-assume the throne, which he duly reclaimed in 1995, only tobe killed in a car crash in January the following year.So the BCP was back in office, albeit lacking key support in thesecurity forces. But as time moved on towards the next election(scheduled at the latest under the constitution for early 1998), theruling party was to be torn apart by a struggle for succession to theoctogenarian, and ailing, Mokhehle. The party soon polarised into twofactions, the Maporesha, who supported Molapo Qhobela, the deputyleader; and the Majelathoko, which initially backed the primeminister’s brother, Shakhane Mokhehle. The former had gainedascendancy with its capture of majority control of the NationalExecutive Committee (NEC) at the party’s Annual Conference in1994. In response, the latter faction managed to manipulate voting atthe delayed 1995 Conference (held in March 1996) which sawShakhane Mokhehle appear to regain a slender majority. When fourconstituency organisations brought objections to the High Court onbehalf of the Maporesha faction, Mr Justice Mofolo ruled first (18October 1996) that the leader of the party should seek an amicablesettlement between the elements concerned. But the prime minister washimself aligned with the Majelathoko, and made little effort to heal therift. The immediate outcome was that on 25 November, the HighCourt ruled that the 1995 Conference had been irregularly conducted,recognised the 1994–5 NEC as the legal executive, and charged it withreconvening the 1995 Conference and holding new elections. A laterruling insisted that these be held by January 24.Despite vigorous efforts made to delay it (spearheaded by DeputyPrime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, who had now emerged at the headof the Majelathoko faction), the Conference reconvened on 24 January676 roger southall and roddy fox1997. It was attended by 500 delegates from 51 of the 65 constituencies,but was largely boycotted by the Majelathoko faction, including the 35MPs in that camp. Qhobela was thereupon re-elected deputy leader, aswere most of the 1994–5 executive to their official party positions.However the Majelathoko faction now returned to the High Court,securing a judgment that there had been further irregularities in theconduct of the latest conference, which should now be convened for athird time.This third meeting opened on 28 February, with a considerableattendance by the Majelathoko faction, (although the prime ministerchose not to attend). However, when the first vote went against them,the Majelathoko supporters walked out, leaving the conference to re-elect the NEC. This was followed by passage of a resolution thatMokhehle should be removed from the party leadership with immediateeffect. But the problem for the Maporesha faction was that they had thesupport of only about twenty-five of the sixty-five MPs, whereas thenational constitution laid out that the prime minister could only betoppled by a successful motion of no confidence. The predictableoutcome was that Mokhehle was confirmed by the National Assemblyas prime minister amidst scenes of high tension and disorder.Despite his confirmation by the Assembly, Mokhehle still lackedcontrol over the party machinery. Consequently, after a series of violentclashes between supporters of the rival factions, he opted for theunconventional device of leaving the party he had founded andcreating the LCD in its place as the ruling party, leaving the BCP asa rump. He had already told his supporters that he would soon beretiring on account of his ill-health, and Pakalitha Mosisili soonsucceeded him as party leader. However, in order to secure thesuccession, Mokhehle remained as prime minister in order to lead theLCD into the general election he called for May 1998. However, as aresult of this history of bitter, internecine fighting, that contest was heldagainst not only the background of the longstanding enmity betweenthe BNP and Mokhehle, but in the wake of fratricidal conflict withinthe historic camp of the BCP (Sekatle 1998). The question in May1998, therefore, was: did the electorate which voted for the BCP in1993 owe their allegiance mainly to the man or the party?#lesotho ’s general election of 1998 677the official outcome of the may 1998 election and theresultant cris i sThe framework for the 1998 election differed from that of 1993 byvirtue of three significant changes. First, the age at which Lesothocitizens were enabled to vote had been lowered from 21 to 18. Second,the number of constituencies had been increased from sixty-five toeighty. And third, in response to opposition complaints that theElectoral Office which had run the 1993 election could be too easilyinfluenced by government, administration of the 1998 election wasundertaken by an Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), whichwas sworn in in September 1997.A process of updating the 1993 voters’ rolls had been undertaken in1996, but had to be repeated the following year following the reductionin the voting age. However, when it came to the lead up to the election,the number of names on the voters’ roll for each constituency was atsome variance with the total number of voters indicated for eachconstituency by the new constituency demarcation (outlined in LG1998). Eventually, following failure of the IEC to reconcile thesedifferences, the BNP, BCP and MFP lodged an application with theHigh Court to have the elections postponed on the basis of inaccuraciesin the voters’ rolls, only to have this rejected by the High Court on thegrounds that it did not have the jurisdiction to do so. So the electionproceeded, but already against a background of distrust on the part ofthe opposition.The electorate was offered a choice of some 438 candidates for the 80constituencies (although, in the event, election day saw a fight for only79 constituencies, as the death of a candidate in the Moyeniconstituency saw the postponement of that contest to a by-election).The LCD and BCP put up candidates in all constituencies, the BNP inall but one, and the MFP in 58 constituencies. The remainingcandidates were divided between some eight other parties (the SefateDemocratic Union, the Lesotho Education Party, the NationalProgressive Party, Khoeetsa ea Sechabe (Popular Front for Democ-racy), the Kopanang Basotho party, the Christian Democratic Party,the Lesotho Labour Party (allied to the United Democratic Party) andthe National Independence Party, as well as there being some thirtyindependents (Rule 1998).The results posted by the IEC, compared with those for the 1993election, are given in Table 1. The election had been watched over bysome 400 observers from some 7 domestic non-government organis-678 roger southall and roddy foxTable 1Summarised results of the general elections of 1993 and 19981993 1998 Net increase}(decrease)Registered Voters 763,930 837,608 76,678Voters* 523,678 596,049 63,371BCP 398,355 (74–7%) 61,995 (10–4%) (336,360)LCD — 360,665 (60–5%)MFP 7,650 (1–4%) 9,129 (1–5%) 1,479BNP 120,686 (22–6%) 145,210 (24–4%) 24,524Others 5,987 (1–1%) 19,050 (3–2%) 13,063BCP›LCD 422,079 (71–06)Sources : Lucas 1993 ; Rule 1998.* 1998 voting figures are for 79 constituencies only.ations as well as 150 observers from 15 different countries, and from theEuropean Union, SADC, the Organisation of African Unity, theUnited Nations Development Programme, the Ecumenical Docu-mentation and Information Centre for Eastern and Southern Africa,and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. There was somedisagreement between the different observer groups about the use ofthe words ‘ free and fair ’ (Rule 1998 : 11), but in their joint statement,based upon their observations conducted in around two-thirds of thepolling stations, they recorded that voting and counting of the ballothad progressed in an orderly and peaceful manner, and although therewere ‘ some minor logistical problems which were properly addressedby the Electoral Authority ’, ‘All the evidence collected by observerssupports the conclusion that the election was conducted in a mannerwhich should be considered acceptable according to internationalstandards ’ (Joint Statement 1998).In its own more critical statement, the Lesotho Council of Non-Government Organisations (LCN) recorded that : the seven weekperiod allowed for voter registration had been inadequate, the IEC hadbeen established too close to the date of the election, the coverage of theelection by Radio Lesotho had been biased in favour of the government,the secrecy of the ballot was not always satisfactorily ensured, officialresources (notably vehicles) had been misused in favour of the LCD,and in addition, the government had sought to influence voters in thelead up to the election via the award of a 10 per cent salary incrementto civil servants and the distribution of some Maluti 82 million (aboutlesotho ’s general election of 1998 679$US 12–8 million) funding to farmers. None the less, having taken allfactors into account, the LCN concluded that the election results were‘reflective of the electorate on polling day’ (LCN 1998).However, as in 1993, the operation of the FPTP electoral system hadprovided the ruling party with a virtual clean sweep and left theopposition unrepresented in the new parliament (save for the BNP’sone derisory victory in the Bobatsi constituency). In 1993, the BCP hadbeen the beneficiary of this outcome, but now it was as shell-shocked bythe outcome as the BNP.Mosisili had predicted a landslide towards the LCD before theelection, but the BCP and BNP had dismissed this as campaign talk.The context must be recalled. There are no opinion polls in Lesotho,which is in any case a country of constant political rumour andspeculation. And after the fratricidal strife within its ranks andMokhehle’s creation of the LCD, the BCP was still confident that itwas master of at least a substantial segment of the party’s historicconstituency. And, given the bitterness of the split, it was now disposedto deal even with its ancient enemy, the BNP. Thus it was that beforethe election there was much talk that the 1998 election would return ahung Assembly, and the BCP and BNP would cobble together acoalition to rule the country for the next five years. For its part, theBNP – still unbelieving of the result of 1993 – had seen the split in theruling party’s ranks as offering a route back to power. In short, giventhese high hopes amongst both major opposition contenders, both theBNP and BCP regarded the outcome of the election with totalincredulity. It confirmed all their suspicions about the determination ofthe LCD to rig the result and about what they deemed the IEC’s lackof partiality. And the endorsements of the election by the differentobserver groups only reinforced their sense that they were up against amajor conspiracy.Thus it was that the BCP and BNP now came together in a marriageof convenience, soon being joined by the vocally noisy but insignificantMFP to forge an ‘Opposition Alliance’. Together they proclaimed toall and sundry that the election had been rigged and that thegovernment was in consequence illegitimate. Reference of the results insix constituencies to the High Court resulted in a judgment that therewas insufficient evidence to prove systematic fraud, but that the recordsof the IEC should be made available for scrutiny. Opposition supporterswere mobilised to demonstrate in Maseru, and the Alliance now openlycalled upon King Letsie to dismiss the government (authority that hedid not possess under the constitution). Meanwhile, the opposition case680 roger southall and roddy foxthat the election had been rigged was taken up by sections of the SouthAfrican and international media, all of which contributed to a growingsense of crisis, not least because the government seemed paralysed, eventhough rumours circulated that it was contemplating banishing theking and declaring a state of emergency. But underlying the new primeminister’s uncertainty was his realisation that his government waswholly unable to rely upon the support of the security forces.Regional concern at the rising tension in the kingdom increased as,from 11 August, hundreds of opposition supporters began to congregateat the gates of the king’s palace in Maseru. In advance of the march onthe palace, the police commissioner had ordered the erection ofroadblocks, and that protestors should be turned back. But his orderswere not carried out. BNP youths were summoned from throughout thecountry (although they streamed in largely from the peri-urban areasof the capital), and made for the palace, where they received food andsustenance. Then, in a radio broadcast that night, army chief MakhulaMosakeng ordered the crowds to disperse. When they refused, teargaswas used against them by soldiers reportedly following orders, but asecond contingent of troops aimed their weapons at their colleagues,who then backed off.Such incidents spoke of mounting tensions within the military, andthe possibility of an outbreak of conflict between different armyfactions. Some observers construed this as a possible divide betweenfactions inclined towards the government and the oppositionrespectively – yet this was to overlook the more complex divisionswhich, inter alia, had seen the break-out of hostilities between soldiersfrom the Rajamotse and Makaonyane barracks during the monthsleading up to the king’s coup of August 1994. Whatever the fault lines,there was clear warning that the sustained opposition protest mightwork to inflame the pre-existing tensions within the army, andprecipitate the army into a more general crisis.It was against the background of these mounting tensions and therole played by the troika of South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe inresolving the king’s coup, that the LCD government proved to be in noposition to gainsay SADC’s proposal, driven by South African DeputyPresident Thabo Mbeki, that the best way to resolve the crisis was viathe appointment of a commission to examine the conduct of the recentelection and to adjudicate upon the validity of the result. (Thisinitiative, it must be said, was probably also driven by Mbeki’s ownapparent lack of conviction that the election had been properlyconducted.)lesotho ’s general election of 1998 681The resultant SADC Commission began work in the second week ofAugust and was headed by Judge Pius Langa of South Africa. It wastasked with working with the IEC, hearing evidence presented to it bythe contesting parties, examining the official results, and conducting arecount. Overall, the Commission appears to have conducted its spadework relatively efficiently, but the announcement of its findings was tobe delayed by what was subsequently referred to as the need to reportto SADC leaders when they were meeting in Mauritius.In the interim, the Lesotho government totally lost control over thedomestic situation, as gun-wielding opposition supporters effectivelytook over the capital, preventing civil servants getting to work,hijacking vehicles and closing down Radio Lesotho. Then, on 11September, a group of junior officers arrested Major-GeneralMosakeng and forced him to read a message over the radio dismissingsome twenty-eight senior officers. The junior officers denied that theywere staging a coup and proclaimed that they were merely attemptingto create a non-partisan defence force – but the threat of a furthermilitary intervention clearly worried SADC, precipitating a visit toMaseru by South African Defence Minister Joe Modise. He secured therelease of the twenty-eight detained senior officers (most of whom fledto South Africa) but failed to resolve the crisis within the army. TheLCD cabinet, meanwhile, denied that it was under house arrest, but itwas by now wholly evident that the opposition (led by the BNP), thesoldiery and elements of the police were working together to paralysethe functioning of government.$The delay in releasing the Langa Commission fed all sort of rumours,not least of which was one, favoured by the South African weekly TheMail and Guardian (9–15 September 1998), that argued that the reporthad been so condemnatory of the LCD that Mbeki had had to refer itback to the troika of heads of state. These suspicions undoubtedlyencouraged the opposition to make increasingly bold demonstrationsagainst the government. But eventually, the Langa Commission’sReport was made available to the political parties on 17 September.The Report argued that there were numerous irregularities andadministrative flaws in the electoral process. However, it also statedthat :it was unable to state that the invalidity of the elections has been conclusivelyestablished. We point out, however, that some of the apparent irregularitiesand discrepancies are sufficiently serious concerns. We cannot howeverpostulate that the result does not reflect the will of the Lesotho electorate.(Langa 1998 : para. 7.7)682 roger southall and roddy foxThis – as we shall argue below, rather limp finding – gave somemeasure of satisfaction and dissatisfaction to both the government andthe opposition parties. However, before the parties had had time todeliberate the contents of the Report, the LCD had despatched secretrequests to SADC to intervene militarily, and on 22 September, theSANDF did just that.The disastrous turn of events that followed, and their consequences,have been discussed elsewhere (Southall 1998a; de Coning 1998 ;Matlosa 1998). But for the purposes of this discussion, what matters isthat they have set the scene for a repeat election apparently to be heldin 2000. And to assess the results of that election, we will need to havea proper understanding of what happened in 1998. And that meansthat we have to go beyond the ambiguities introduced by theconclusion of the Langa Commission.the opposition case against the resultThe opposition case against the election result was initially stated mostforcefully and publicly by a reporter for the Johannesburg Mail andGuardian who was writing under the pseudonym of William Boot. (Theoriginal William Boot was, of course, Evelyn Waugh’s reporter for theThe Daily Beast to the exotic East African country of Ishmaelia in hissatirical novel, Scoop.) We believe that, over the course of several weeklyreports, Boot’s uncritical recycling of the litany of opposition complaintsactually exacerbated the crisis, not least because the Mail and Guardianis one of South Africa’s most serious newspapers and one with anhonourable tradition of critical journalism during and indeed after thestruggle against apartheid. Whoever Boot was (his}her identity remainsa mystery), his reports extended an initial credibility to the oppositionparties’ case and enabled them to launch a propaganda offensive whichthe LCD completely failed to match. But, although Boot was more thanhappy to repeat rumour as fact, it would seem that he never left theopposition stronghold of Maseru, and failed utterly to locate hiscritique of the result in the context of Lesotho’s history.%According to Boot, in one of his earlier pieces (Mail and Guardian,7–13 August 1998): ‘The evidence is all but irrefutable : the May 23elections were rigged.’ He went on to outline the grounds for this verdictas follows:1. Votes in nearly half the country’s 80 constituencies were recountedthis week. It has been found that the ruling Lesotho Congress oflesotho ’s general election of 1998 683Democrats (LCD) won only 12 seats, less than a third of the total.’He stated that the ‘ongoing recount ’ followed a ruling in the LesothoHigh Court of July 22 which ordered that the major oppositionparties be given access to previously suppressed IEC documentation.2. A forensic audit of the voters’ roll by a firm of South Africanconsultants, OF&A, hired by the BNP, revealed some seeminglyinexplicable demographic peculiarities. Notably, there was a patternof recorded birthdates which defied explanation. In every con-stituency, analysis of the roll revealed a ‘vastly higher ’ number ofbirths (sometimes four or five times as many) on 1 January than onany other day in that month. Even more puzzling, the same was truein the ascending sequence: 2 February, 3 March, 4 April etc. Alarger number of people were also found to have had birthdays onthe first of the month than on the second. Such a pattern, concludedthe auditors, indicated that ‘ the voters ’ roll was manipulated’.3. The IEC was less than independent, indeed it was financiallydependent upon and shared the same firm of lawyers as thegovernment, and it was frankly biased in favour of the LCD. In atleast two (unnamed) constituencies, alleged Boot, the LCD candi-dates had already conceded defeat to his BCP opponent before theIEC announced them as the winners and subsequently, (Mail andGuardian, 14–20 August 1998), Boot further stated that :4. Electoral logistics, including the collection of ballot boxes, had beenorganised by the Tactical Intelligence Bureau on the orders ofMajor-General Mosakeng, who had aligned himself with the LCD.5. High-level orders were given even before the appointment of theLanga Commission for the systematic destruction of electiondocumentation, supposedly in the safe care of the IEC, to obstructretrospective analysis of the result. Otherwise, there was widespreadindication of massive tampering of ballots and so on by the IEC.The flawed basis of Boot’s reportage was illustrated when the contentof his first allegation fell away when the opposition parties availedthemselves of the opportunity to put evidence of fraud to the LangaCommission. They made no mention in their documentation what-soever of any recount that had demonstrated that the LCD had onlywon 12 out of 40 seats. Nor did they make any mention of constituencieswhere the IEC had overturned election results after the LCD hadalready conceded defeat. However, if we discount the withdrawal ofthese two crucial allegations, Boot’s summary of the opposition parties’complaints can be taken as an adequate summary of their case, save for684 roger southall and roddy foxthe fact that the BNP also put forward a regression analysis of theresults which purported to suggest extensive fraud (BNP 1998).For all that Boot’s backing of the opposition may have been over-enthusiastic, some of the opposition charges clearly merited investi-gation, and there were many who opined that where there was smoke,there was likely to be fire. How then, do the opposition allegationsstand up when subject to careful scrutiny?the refutation of the opposition caseWe believe that, although there are considerable grounds for queryingthe capacity and efficiency of the IEC, and although there is a case tobe made that there may have been something of an attempt tomanipulate the voters roll in order to produce ‘ghost voters ’, theopposition case that the election was rigged is largely without substance.We intend to back up our analysis : first, by noting what the LCDand}or IEC did not do ; second, by supplementing the judgements of theLanga Commission to indicate that even where there is some basis inopposition complaint, errors of omission or commission by the IECwere not of an extent to materially alter the outcome of the election;and third, by exploring the compatibility of the result of 1998 with thatof 1993.What the LCD}IEC did not doThere are at least eight principal ways in which elections may be riggedby an incumbent government; (i) restrictions may be placed uponopposition activity ; (ii) voter registration procedures may be abused;(iii) the size of constituencies may be manipulated to favour rulingparty candidates and disadvantage opposition party candidates ; (iv)the registration of opposition candidates may be denied; (v) stateresources may be utilised to favour the ruling party; (vi) the nationalconstitution may be changed to favour the ruling party; (vii) votingand counting procedures may be abused; and, if all else fails (viii) thegovernment may annul or overturn the result of the election (Danieland Southall 1999). Of course, with the exception of (viii), mereemployment of any one or more of these strategies may not be enoughto swing an election in a ruling party’s favour. For an election to beeffectively rigged (‘stolen’ might be a better term), we have to proveintent plus capacity plus the decisive nature of any intervention.lesotho ’s general election of 1998 685In terms of the complaints laid before the Langa Commission, theLCD stood accused of only (ii) and (vii) (although as we have seen, theLCN also felt that the government was guilty of utilising state resourcesin favour of the LCD). But given the energy of the opposition parties’protests, it becomes extremely important to note that their complaintsreferred to just two of the strategies commonly employed by incumbentsto swing elections. In particular, it is worth observing.First, no charges were laid that opposition candidates were preventedfrom standing in the election, or opposition parties prevented fromparticipating in the electoral process. Indeed, the 1998 contest sawmore candidates and more parties standing for election than everbefore.Second, there was no suggestion by the opposition that the governmenthad ‘ loaded’ constituencies to favour LCD by unfairly concentratingopposition voters in single member constituencies of above average size,a strategy systematically employed in its own interest by KANU inKenya (Fox 1996). The delimitation which preceded the electionaimed for approximately 10,000 voters per constituency. In the event,when voters registered, Maseru constituencies did exceed the 10,000,apparently because many migrant workers registered in the capitalinstead of returning to their home constituencies. But precisely becausethe 1993 election results demonstrated that political support for thedifferent political parties (notably BCP and BNP) was spreadreasonably evenly around the country, without majority concentrationsof support for the BNP in any constituency (Fox 1995), there was noobvious way to ‘ load’ the delimitation.Third, the only constitutional change effected after 1993 which hada direct bearing upon the elections was the Act which replaced theElectoral Office with the IEC, a body only reluctantly created by thegovernment in response to opposition charges that its predecessor bodywas not sufficiently independent. That the opposition thereafter foundsystematic fault with the IEC is another issue, which will be dealt withbelow.Finally, it is a cheap point, but one worth making. The only electionresult which has ever been overturned in Lesotho is that of 1970, whenthe BNP declined to hand over power to the victorious BCP. And themembers of the latter-day BCP were as happy to endorse their ownparty’s clean sweep in 1993 as they were militant in repudiating thelandslide to the LCD in 1998.So let us now examine the basis for the charges that the oppositionwas making.686 roger southall and roddy foxDid the LCD systematically abuse voter registration, voting and countingprocedures, and if so, did it do so to the extent that such abuses significantlyaffected the outcome of the election?The discussion of the detailed complaints relating to these questionsconstitutes the body of the text of the Report of the Langa Commission,which it is impossible to reproduce in full here. What does comethrough is that, whether or not there was a deliberate attempt bymembers of the IEC or electoral officers to destroy damning evidence,or whether the IEC was simply overwhelmed by the task of storing andcollating the documentation pertaining to the election, the recordssupplied to the Commission were, in their words, ‘ in a chaotic state ’(Langa 1998 : para. 7–2). Seals of containers with votes in them wereoften broken, counterfoils did not tie up with votes cast, material fromone polling station was mixed up with that from another, and so on. Assuch, this seriously detracted from the integrity of the audit which theCommission was attempting to conduct. This constituted a seriousfailure on the part of the IEC, but as the Commission went on to note,this has to be viewed in the context that the IEC did not receive anyguidance from the predecessor Electoral Office, and it had only a veryshort time to complete the massive tasks of registering voters, delimitingconstituencies and adding in new voters consequent upon the loweringof the voting age from 21 to 18, as well as undertaking voter education.More particularly, during the election itself, it had to depend upontemporarily employed electoral staff, and was faced by severe logisticalconstraints due to computer breakdowns, a lack of space, and poorfacilities at voter stations and so on. Even so, there seems little doubtthat its guardianship of the electoral records after the election was atotal mess. But this is not enough to invalidate the result of the election.Any reader of the Langa Commission report is likely to becomebogged down in detail. But we may summarise what the Commissionfound by reference to their findings concerning the ten points which itdeemed to provide the basis of the opposition’s allegations :1. Results which were announced in constituencies could not be reconciled with thenumber of people who presented themselves for voting (Langa 1998 : para4.1). The Commission endorsed Opposition auditors’ findings thatthere were substantial irregularities and inconsistencies in the votingrecords. However, although this meant that the integrity of the auditwas compromised, a recount of the vote undertaken by theCommission in 66 constituencies showed little difference from theofficial results (para. 7.1.).lesotho ’s general election of 1998 6872. The final voters’ list showed an unnatural pattern in the distribution of birthdates to produce a large number of ‘ghost voters ’ (para. 4.2). TheCommission noted the IEC’s comment that the majority of Lesotho’spopulation do not know their actual birth dates, the implicationbeing that those registering voters may have adopted a particularstrategy in attributing particular birthdays (the 1st of the 1st month,the 2nd of the 2nd month etc.) to voters not able to proffer theiractual birthdates. The Commission reported, however, that it wasunable to establish the cause of the unusual patterns displayed by thevoters’ rolls. But it added that ‘ the phenomenon is not of materialinterest unless it can be shown that it somehow enabled the castingof duplicate or ‘‘ghost ’’ votes ’. The opposition was unable to provethis (paras. 5.2 and 6.2). However, as the skewed pattern of birthdates constituted the primary evidence put forward by theopposition, we have gone beyond the analysis of the LangaCommission to validate their conclusion. We offer this in section 5below.3. Persons who were not entitled to vote because they did not have properidentification records did so. The Commission was unable to concludethat there was any evidence that this had taken place systematically.But even if unregistered voters had voted, it opined that it was notclear that ‘ it would have influenced the elections one way or theother ’ (para 5.3).4. The IEC was very uncooperative in its dealings with the opposition (para.4.4). The IEC simply noted opposition allegations and IEC rebuttalswithout comment (para. 5.4).5. The Multiple Regression analysis conducted on behalf of the oppositionpurported to demonstrate that there was correlation between the voting patternsand the election results (para. 4.5). The Commission dismissed theanalysis as incomplete, inter alia for having failed to specify itsdependent variables and covariates. In any case, the regressionanalysis found only patterns in the data and correlations among thedata which were to be expected (para. 5.5). In short, in the words ofexpert statistical advice given to the Commission, ‘ the regressionanalysis puts forward as problems what turn out to be uncontro-versial facts : notably that in a ‘first past the post ’ electoral system,a party may get more votes than its competitors in a constituency,and thus win it, without achieving more than 50 per cent of the votein that constituency; and that in areas where the vote of a winningparty is highest, the combined vote of its competitors will be lowest ’(‘Expert Opinion’ 1998).688 roger southall and roddy fox6. Extra ballot papers were obtained from a South African supplier by the IECfor clandestine and fraudulent use by ‘ghost voters ’ (para. 4.6). Theopposition parties proved unable to substantiate the rumour anddecided not to pursue the allegation (para. 5.6).7. Military Intelligence were used to transport electoral materials from Maseruto the districts without those officers having been seconded to the IEC, as wasrequired by the law (para. 4.7). The IEC reported to the Commissionthat all electoral material was carried in IEC vehicles driven by IECstaff. Members of the security forces were asked to escort the vehicles.The IEC denied that there was a legal requirement that these escortsbe seconded to the IEC. The Commission made no further comment(para. 5.7).8. A first director of elections within the IEC was removed from his post becausehe had refused to condone irregularities (para. 4.8). The IEC response wasthat the matter was simply an administrative issue. The Commissionnoted that it was not in a position to explore the matter further, butadded that ‘It was not clear that the issue had a direct bearing onthe conduct of the elections ’ (para. 5.8).9. There were two incidents where electoral material had been found abandoned,one on the banks of the Kolonyama River, the other near the Mohakare river(para. 4.9). The IEC reported that it was still investigating theformer incident. In the latter case, an IEC vehicle carrying voterregistration forms had been hi-jacked; 200 original voter applicationforms had been recovered, and the applicants’ details captured, sothey were not disenfranchised. The balance of the forms wereduplicates. The IEC vehicle had not yet been recovered. Again, theCommission did not comment (para 5.9).10. The close relationship between the government and the IEC impinged on thelatter’s neutrality and independence (para. 4.10). The Commission foundnothing irregular in the relationship, noting that the IEC had tointeract regularly with the government (para. 5.10).In summary, therefore, the Langa Commission either rejectedoutright or found no substantial basis for supporting fully eight out ofthe opposition parties’ major complaints. Otherwise, it found the IECrecords a mess, but its own limited recount of the poll showed littledifference from the announced result. But even though it noted that theopposition had failed to prove the systematic voting by ghost voters, itdid accept that there was something very unusual about the pattern ofbirths recorded in the voting register. The implication of this, therefore,requires special attention.lesotho ’s general election of 1998 689Table 2Suspected anomalous birth dates in the 1998 voters’ roll1 January — —2 February — —3 March 13 March 23 March4 April 14 April 24 April5 May 15 May 25 May6 June 16 June 26 June7 July 17 July 27 July8 August 18 August 28 August9 September 19 September 29 September10 October 20 October 30 October11 November 21 November12 December 22 DecemberGhost voters and the case for electronic riggingOpposition parties maintained that the Voters’ Roll was manipulatedto produce ‘ghost ’ voters. The evidence they gave was an assessment ofdates of birth of registered voters, by constituency, which shows thatthere was a regular pattern of approximately double the number ofvoters than would be expected on approximately 33 of the 365 days ofthe year. Table 2 lists this pattern of days, which also demonstrates thatChristmas Day and 3 December, which lie outside this distribution,also had ‘extra’ people.There is no demographic reason for such a regular sequence ofdouble the number of people born on the following day of each month.Therefore, it makes sense to make a ‘worst case ’ deduction that theelectronic data was manipulated through a simple computer pro-gramme that went to all records dated 1 January and duplicated them,to 2 February and duplicated them and so on. When the programmereached the 12th day of the 12th month it continued by going to the13th of the 3rd month, 14th of the 4th and so on. The furtherassumption would then be that these ‘ghosts ’ were then somehowadded to the tally of Lesotho Congress for Democracy votes to ensuretheir sweeping victory in 78 of the 79 constituencies.If this occurred, can we establish how many ‘ghosts ’ there were? Ifwe can, then it should be possible to deduct the number of ‘ghosts ’ fromthe LCD vote in each constituency and then see what the outcome ofthe elections would have been. We can readily calculate the ‘ghost ’vote by selecting the days of the year that follow the anomalous pattern690 roger southall and roddy foxdescribed above with double the number of expected voters, addingtogether how many voters that was and then halving that number. Forexample in Constituency 1 – Mechachane – there were 1,401 peopleborn on the ‘doubled’ days of the year so there must have been 700‘ghost voters ’. If we subtract 700 from the LCD’s vote of 3,356 weget a reduced total of 2,656. As it turns out that was still enough votesto win the constituency since the BNP only polled 1643 and the BCP1,096.If we repeat this process throughout the entire country we find thatthe LCD would still have won fully 75 out of the 79 seats contested.&Under this procedure, only the three constituencies of Kolonyama,Mount Moorosi and Mokhotlong would have fallen to the opposition,as it happens to the BNP. In other words, if we accept the argumentthat there were ‘ghost ’ voters and that the Voters’ Roll was tamperedwith, actually having the extra voters would have done very little toalter the overall result. It would have shifted from LCD 78 and BNP1 to LCD 75 and BNP 4 seats.We may note, that if this was the case, then geographically, theBNP’s constituencies would have been located in areas where they hadsupport in previous elections. Bobatsi and Mokhotlong are located inthe east of the country, where the BNP polled in excess of 62–5 per centof the vote in 1965. In the 1993 elections this area was won by the BCPbut the BNP’s poll was high, given its overall poor performance in thatelection, with the BNP receiving over 30 per cent of the vote. Similarpatterns occur at Mount Moorosi in the south of the country where theBNP had in excess of 62–5 per cent in 1965 and 38 per cent in 1993, thehighest percentage in the whole country. In Kolonyama, also, the BNPhad over 30 per cent of the vote in 1993. So the geographicaldistribution of these constituencies may lead us to suspect that theywere potentially BNP seats and thus the most susceptible to ‘ghost ’voting affecting the result.However, difficulties with the ‘ghost ’ voters come when we try tosee how they would actually have voted. We need to remember that the‘ghosts ’ would have had to have physically voted in their homeconstituency since the counting of votes and announcing of results isdone at that level. This would have meant either that many peoplevoted twice or that large numbers of ‘outside’ voters magicallyappeared in every constituency across the country. Frankly, it is hard tosee how either of these occurrences could have happened without theirbeing noticed by the opposition parties and the electoral observers –and they weren’t. As already noted, Lesotho’s constituencies are smalllesotho ’s general election of 1998 691with an average of 10,000 registered voters, roughly 10 per cent ofwhom were ‘ghosts ’ if we accept the evidence above, If, therefore, wepostulate a 100 per cent turnout of ‘ghosts ’ then every tenth voter inline was either going to vote twice or would be an unknown outsider.It is difficult to see how this can possibly have happened withoutsomeone noticing it. In addition, the opposition assumption is that allghost voters would have voted for the LCD, although this could not ofcourse be guaranteed.The upshot of the ‘ghost voter ’ phenomenon is, therefore, that evenif it did happen, which is unlikely, it would have made no substantialdifference to the overall outcome of the election.The compatibility of the  with the  resultsComparison between the 1993 and the 1998 election results has beenmade difficult by the increase in the number of constituencies fromsixty-five to eighty, and the redrawing of constituency boundaries thatthat entailed. None the less, it is evident that the overall patterns in thetwo elections appear to be broadly similar (see Table 1 above). Forinstance, voter turnout was 72 per cent in 1993 and 74 per cent in 1998.But more important is the fact that, if we compare the BCP vote in 1993with that for the LCD plus the BCP in 1998 (on the grounds that in1998 the two parties’ vote was drawn from what was only one politicalcommunity in 1993), then we see, that whereas the BCP vote in 1993was 75 per cent, the combined vote for the two parties in 1998 was 71per cent (BCP 10–4 per cent›LCD 60–5 per cent). The BNP vote in1993 was 23 per cent compared to 24 per cent in 1998, and the MFPgained 1–45 per cent in 1998 and 1–3 per cent in 1998.Where there is a difference is that whereas in 1993 the BCP wonevery seat with an arithmetic majority, in 1998 the LCD won fourteenseats with a plurality vote, and another eight constituencies withbetween 50 and 55 per cent of the votes cast. But given the split in theranks of the 1993 BCP, this outcome was to be fully expected. In short,as in 1993, the exclusion of opposition candidates from parliament wasa product of the first past the post system, and the way in which thevote split between the BCP and the LCD in particular.: : :All in all, we are forced to the conclusion that the opposition parties692 roger southall and roddy foxhad no firm basis for alleging that the general election of 1998 wasrigged. The government may have used the advantages of incumbencyto swing the vote its way, and there may possibly have been someattempt to influence the outcome by a manipulation of the voters’ roll– but, even if this was the case, the attempt was conceptually andmechanically flawed. The evidence before the Langa Commission alsoclearly indicates that the IEC was overwhelmed by its task and that, atconstituency level, there may have been some occasional attempts bylocal electoral officials to massage results. But there is no credibleevidence whatsoever that there was a concerted and centrally directed,meaningful, significant and effective attempt to rig the election.This of course leaves some important questions unanswered. Inparticular, why was it that the split in the 1993 BCP vote fell sounevenly in favour of the LCD? Why was the opposition so convincedthat it had been robbed? Why was it that the report of the LangaCommission was so non-committal when it could find so little hardevidence to back the opposition allegations? And not least, what doesthis tell us about what should be done for the future?Detailed sociopolitical investigation of the breakdown of the LCDand BCP vote in 1998 is still required, but we believe – from discussionwith key political actors and observers in Lesotho – that there is a fairlysimple explanation for the way the vote split. Broadly speaking, theanswer seems to be that the voting followed class lines. Mokhehletook with him out of the BCP the affections of a major portion ofthe poorer and rural population, and although he had lost controlof the party NEC, his supporters retained control of the party machineryin most constituencies. In contrast, the BCP retained only a mainlymiddle-class backing, except in Mokhotlong, where it seems to haveretained something of a wider basis of support. All in all, the BCP wasleft as a rump, and it is the LCD which has now inherited its populisttradition.Yet, given the lack of opinion polling, the BCP may be forgiven forassuming before the election that the voting was split more evenly. Incontrast, the BNP is still grappling to comprehend the fact and theextent of its defeat in 1993. It remains, in the countryside, the party ofthe chiefs, and more generally, its hierarchy is composed of elementswho enjoyed the exercise of power for twenty years after independence.And in a small and impoverished economy where control of thegovernment provides the main route to jobs, patronage, income andwealth, they are still smarting from their loss of power. It needs alsoto be added that there is a large element of self-delusion. In the case oflesotho ’s general election of 1998 693the BNP particularly, there seems to be a lack of willingness to confrontthe evidence of defeat. There is still widespread disbelief that the 1993election was really lost, and an almost systematic resort to conspiracytheory to explain the party’s current minority status.We remain puzzled as to why the Langa Commission was so limp inits judgement. As we have demonstrated, it rejected the large body ofthe opposition’s allegations. Why then did it not come out moreforthrightly to declare the LCD the winner? There are a number ofpossible explanations.The first, offered by William Boot and much favoured by theopposition, is that there were in actuality two versions of the LangaReport. The first version was allegedly far more condemnatory of theLCD and the IEC than the final published version, and it called for theelections to be annulled and for fresh elections to be held. According tothis version of the story, Foreign Minister Tom Thabane intervenedcovertly with President Mugabe to block the publication of the firstversion, and South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki concludedthat the results of the Report were so ‘highly explosive ’ that there couldbe difficulties in maintaining order ‘ in the light of the expected angeragainst the LCD government’ (Mail and Guardian, 25 September to 1October, 1998). The published report therefore ‘copped out ’ on everyscore and simply watered down its findings.The evidence for this again is unconfirmed and limited only tounspecified ‘sources ’. It also makes the rather crude assumption thatJustice Langa and his team were prepared to have their reportdoctored without breaking ranks. And our view, from detailed readingof the report, is that it simply doesn’t make sense. The report is verydetailed, and logical. It moves easily from point to point, and it hangstogether. All its conclusions on individual allegations are carefullymeasured. Frankly, it would seem that Boot, as ever, was far tooprepared to recycle the sort of rumour that is fairly standard fare in thebars of Lesotho, without balancing his sources.We believe that there is another, and more convincing explanation.This is that, first, the Commission took a concentratedly legalisticattitude, and that it was confronted by clear evidence of the IEC’sincapacity or unwillingness to have its records scrutinised. In thiscontext, it must be recalled that the IEC was in the eye of the storm,and apart from anything else, its staff were feeling highly intimidated.Mr S. Mafisa, the chair of the IEC, was at this time subject to a numberof death threats. The administrative deshabille that is not at all unusual694 roger southall and roddy foxin virtually any institution in Lesotho was probably compounded byfear.But apart from that, we believe that there may have been anadditional political factor. It is our understanding that when the LangaCommission was established, there was an assumption in ThaboMbeki’s office that the LCD had indeed rigged the election. Part of thereason for this sprang from the old connections : the ANC alliance withthe BNP, and the fact that the South African ambassador in Maseru ishimself known to be much closer to the former ruling party than he isto the BCP or LCD. In other words, the intelligence reaching the SouthAfrican government was itself extremely flawed, and initially, of course,this would have been backed up by the skewed reporting offered by thehighly influential Mail and Guardian. Again, this view assumes that theultimate finding of the Langa Commission – that it could not provethat the election was invalid – was less than the sum of its parts. But itis more accepting of the integrity of the lawyers who composed theCommission to assume that they submitted a report which was perhapsunwelcome and surprising to their political masters than it is topropose, pace Boot, that they simply keeled over and compromised theirfindings at the last moment under direct political pressure.Whatever the case, the indecisiveness of the Langa Report probablycontributed to the worsening of the crisis. A more forceful endorsementof the election result would have shored up the LCD’s legitimacy, andperhaps eroded the confidence of the opposition. If coupled withstronger diplomacy from South Africa and SADC, armed interventionmight even have been averted. All that is speculation. But, as indicatedin our introduction, what does emerge from the whole catastrophe thatswept Lesotho is the need for a new electoral system.This matter is now being considered by the IPA, and it would seemthat there is emergent agreement around the need for change. Thedetails of what reform should be adopted remain contentious. It isbeyond the scope of this article to suggest what particular electoralsystem would be most appropriate – but what is clear from the wholecrisis is that the next election must allow for a more inclusive outcomewhereby the minority opinion and significant minority parties areenabled to receive representation in the National Assembly. Lesotho’slong-term problems of survival lie far beyond its particular politicalarrangements – but a more representative political system is clearly anecessity if the country is going to have any chance of combiningdemocracy and development. It would also seem that in the run up andlesotho ’s general election of 1998 695aftermath of any election, the IEC is going to need substantialinternational support, to assist both its capacity and its credibility.Finally, a last lesson of this messy and unfortunate interlude.Together with Evelyn Waugh, the Mail and Guardian may considerAfrican kingdoms to be an uproarious joke. But if during the nextelection in Lesotho its reporter insists upon writing under a pseudonym,then he}she should choose a nom de plume which has less patronising, lessracist overtones. Indeed, if William Boot rides again, we will surely beentitled to assume that he is writing for The Weekly Beast.notes1. It is important to stress that neither of us has any political connections to the LCDwhatsoever, nor any reason to promote their particular success. We are writing only as interestedoutsiders, largely upon the basis of our analysis of the election in Lesotho in 1993 (Southall &Petlane 1995).2. This summary of events is constructed from a variety of press cuttings, both local and SouthAfrican. We have not felt it necessary to detail all our sources as our article is focused upon themechanics of the election, not upon the nature and causes of the crisis itself.3. As in note 2.4. Boot’s key pieces in the Mail and Guardian were; ‘Lesotho on edge as poll is disputed’ (29 May– 4 June 1998) ; ‘Lesotho crisis deepens’ (31 July – 6 August 1998) ; ‘Lesotho’s election farce ’(7–13 August 1998) ; ‘Meltdown in the mountain kingdom’ (14–20 August 1998) ; and ‘The twoversions of the Langa Report ’ (25 September–1 October 1998). It is not insignificant that the Mailand Guardian distinguished itself in the issue of 31 July – 6 August 1998 by gracing Boot’s reportwith a large photograph of Prince Charles with Swaziland’s King Mswati, erroneously presuminghim to be King Letsie ! To be fair, however, the paper did allow one of the present authors todispute Boot’s coverage in ‘Fair or fraudulent result? ’ (14–20 August 1998) and ‘Time to giveBoot the boot ’ (2–8 October 1998).5.
