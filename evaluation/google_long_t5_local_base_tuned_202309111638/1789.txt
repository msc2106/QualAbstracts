ABSTRACT: 
Financial status is thought to be an important determinant of psychological well-being. We investigate this relationship, and the effect of other factors, using a parametric mixed modelling approach for panel data, controlling the problem of unobservable heterogeneity. Two nationally representative surveys, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Understanding Society Survey (USS), were used to construct a unified data set which measured psychological well-being and associated factors using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The GHQ-12 score for the head of the household was used as the dependant variable and its relationship with multiple independent demographic and financial status variables was investigated. Following assessment of growth curve characteristics with linear, curvilinear and higher-order polynomial modelling; several variance-covariance structures were tested to assess the error covariance structure of the longitudinal data. The random intercept and random slope were allowed to vary across participants, and methods such as natural splines and B-splines were used to improve the fit of some variables. Our final model demonstrated the most important variables affecting self-reported psychological well-being, as determined by GHQ-12, were perception and expectation of future financial situation and problems meeting household expenditure. Gender, age, marital status, number of children at home, highest qualification and job status were also significantly implicated. Unlike previous studies however we did not find that size of income was significant. These results provide further strong evidence of the impact that financial concerns have on self-reported measures of psychological well-being.

 -nal data. The random intercept and random slope were allowed to vary across participants,and methods such as natural splines and B-splines were used to improve the fit of some var-iables. Our final model demonstrated the most important variables affecting self-reportedpsychological well-being, as determined by GHQ-12, were perception and expectation offuture financial situation and problems meeting household expenditure. Gender, age, mari-tal status, number of children at home, highest qualification and job status were also signifi-cantly implicated. Unlike previous studies however we did not find that size of income wassignificant. These results provide further strong evidence of the impact that financial con-cerns have on self-reported measures of psychological well-being.Introduction and literatureThere is a growing body of evidence implicating personal financial circumstances (PFC’s) andfactors influencing PFC’s as determinants of individual health ([1], [2], [3]).Some authors claim that this may be due to a number of indirect mechanisms and influ-ences although their impact on health are equivocal ([4], [5]). Jones and Widman [5] suggestthat these indirect mechanisms could constitute influences such as income inequality, relativedeprivation, or other equally complex pathways.PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198638 June 13, 2018 1 / 14a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111OPENACCESSCitation: Oskrochi G, Bani-Mustafa A, Oskrochi Y(2018) Factors affecting psychological well-being:Evidence from two nationally representativesurveys.

Mean income levels inmodels of happiness have been used to control for inter-personal comparisons [6], whilst therelationship between well-being and income inequality [7] and life satisfaction and incomedistribution in Russia [8] have more recently been investigated.These comparison effects are increasingly being recognised as important determinants ofhealth. Jones and Wildman [5] noted that if lack of status causes consequent stress, thenincreasing working hours and general unhappiness, should be considered and accounted for.Previous work has also identified that individuals who describe themselves as happy aremore resilient to psychosomatic illnesses, less likely to take time off work, die prematurely,attempt suicide or seek psychological counselling ([9], [6]). Furthermore, if we accept thepremise that health is vital for a flourishing life [10] then understanding the determinants ofpsychological well-being is equally vital.GHQ-12The GL Assessment website defines GHQ as: “The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) is ascreening device for identifying minor psychiatric disorders in the general population andwithin community or non-psychiatric clinical settings such as primary care or general medicalout-patients. Suitable for all ages from adolescent upwards–not children, it assesses the respon-dent’s current state and asks if that differs from his or her usual state. It is therefore sensitive toshort-term psychiatric disorders but not to long-standing attributes of the respondent”(https://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/products/general-health-questionnaire-ghq).The self-administered questionnaire focuses on two major areas; i) The inability to carryout normal functions; ii) The appearance of new and distressing phenomena.It is available in different versions. GHQ-12 which has been used in this study is a quick,reliable and sensitive short form–ideal for research studies.DataIn this study, we explore factors affecting individual psychological well-being in Great Britain,considering the influence of financial situations and demographic characteristics. Our analysisis based on a sample drawn from two nationally surveyed datasets, the British HouseholdPanel Survey (BHPS) and Understanding Society (US). Both BHPS and US contain informa-tion on financial situation, demographic information and individuals psychological well-being.The BHPS is a nationally representative random sample longitudinal survey, carried out bythe Institute for Social and Economic Research, of every adult in more than 5000 private house-holds in Great Britain. Approximately 10,000 individuals were interviewed in waves (1–18)annually between 1991–2008. BHPS’ main objective was to further understand social and eco-nomic change at the individual and household level in Britain.Sampling for subsequent waves consisted of all adults in all households which contained atleast one member who was resident in a household interviewed at Wave 1. New eligibility forsample inclusion could occur between waves in the following ways:a. A baby born to an Original Sample Members (OSM);b. An OSM moves into a household with one or more new people;c. One or more new people move in with an OSM [11].Factors affecting psychological well-beingPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198638 June 13, 2018 2 / 14Competing interests: The authors have declaredthat no competing interests exist.Interviews were sought with all resident household members aged 16 or over, thereforeincludes OSMs previously coded as children.BHPS stopped at wave 18 in 2008, and its successor is Understanding Society (US).Understanding Society (US) is another nationally representative random sample longitudi-nal survey of every adult in 40,000 UK households in Great Britain. US started in 2009 withinterviewing all eligible members of the selected households either face-to-face or over thephone using Computer Assisted Interviewing (CAI).The sample issued at wave 2 of US consisted of all members from the BHPS samplewho were still active at Wave 18 and who had not refused consent to be issued as part ofthe Understanding Society sample [11]. As a result, wave one of US does not cover BHPSsamples.Our sample consists of a panel of 213,365 observations from 49,877 Head of the Households(HoH) who responded to any BHPS (1 to 18) or US (1 to 4) waves until end of 2012. Hence,the observational unit in our study is HoH’s as they have final responsibility for householdfinancial situations and are therefore expected to be more affected psychologically.Key variablesDependent variableMeasure of psychological well-being derived from the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)of the HoH is selected as the dependent variable.The self-completion questionnaire component of the BHPS and US includes a reduced ver-sion of the GHQ [12].The GHQ was originally developed to screen for psychiatric illness but has often been usedas a proxy measure for psychological well-being. The shortened GHQ12 contains 12 individualelements which using a Likert [13] (1–4) scale, respondents state how they have recently feltregarding those elements [5].The overall score ranges from 12 to 48 and lower value indicates good health. TheMean GHQ was calculated as the total GHQ divided by 12 to represent average GHQ ofeach individual. The mean GHQ therefore can be consider as a quantitative variable between1 and 4. In this study the overall average of GHQ amongst 213365 data points is 1.938 (sd.0.463).The GHQ variable is a useful measure of health for determining the effect of income relatedvariables because it measures psychological well-being and mental well-being which concen-trates on broader components of psychiatric morbidity (particularly anxiety and depression).Detecting broad components of psychiatric morbidity is important if financial situation anddeprivation are affecting individuals via stress or psychosocial mechanisms [14].Independent variablesSeveral variables are used in the empirical models to measure financial situation and financialexpectation in the reference year (defined as the 12 months prior to the start of the interviewtime). The variables selected were listed below and the criteria for selection was based onthe relevance and availability in both BHPS and US data. BHPS and US are supposed to becompatible by design. Generally, most of the information in BHPS somehow is available inUS, but not necessarily under the same variable name or with the same format of coding.Therefore, many independent variables needed to be recoded to a unified version betweenBHPS and US.Factors affecting psychological well-beingPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198638 June 13, 2018 3 / 14Scale variables• The income variable gives monthly total household income. In the parametric mixed mod-els, using the log of income to allows a non-linear relationship between health and income([1], [15]) (INCOME_LN).• Labour Income last month [FIMNL];• Total Income last month [FIMN];• Age in year at the date of the interview (AGE);• Number of durable goods purchased (CD_All)• Number of kids in the household (NKIDS)Number of durable goods purchased controls extensively for recent purchases of durablegoods. The variable indicates number of purchase of a colour television, video recorder,freezer, washing machine, tumble dryer, dishwasher, microwave, computer or CD-player, sat-ellite, Cable TV, landline phone within the past years. The descriptive statistics of the quantita-tive variables are given in Table 1.In order to study the relationship between these independent variables and GHQ, pairwisecorrelation is calculated between the independent variables and GHQ and summarized inTable 2. Correlations between all independent variables were significantly and negatively cor-related with GHQ except Number of Children (NKID) was significant and positively corre-lated with GHQ. The highest correlation was with FIMNL followed by FIMN. The leastcorrelation was with age.Categorical variables• Gender (SEX);Table 1.

Inaddition, variance of such clustered data often changes with time. Disregarding the data clus-tered structure could lead to biased estimates of standard errors and potentially higher type Ierror ([16], [17]). Accordingly LMM has been suggested as an appropriate solution addressingthe data clustered structure and modelling the complicated variance covariance structure ofrepeated measurements.Adams et al [18] used panel data methods to control for unobserved heterogeneity in a sim-ilar circumstance. The issue of non-linearity of the relationship between wellbeing and incomeand misspecification in case of neglected non-linearity is discussed by Jones and Wildman [5].Oskrochi et al [19], presented a model for analysing such panel data with multivariate linearmixed model with correlated random effects.A number of studies have indicated the superiority of LMM to GLM or OLS models as theformer produces error terms to control for the correlations resulting from the nature of thedata clusters (individuals/and time), as described above.Furthermore, Linear Mixed Model (LMM) allows tracking psychological well-being overtime (Waves) for each HoH (treated as random effects in the model) by considering the impactof other time-invariant in the model [20]. It is well documented in the literature that LMM issuperior to ordinary least squares (OLS/General Linear Models) because LMM theoreticallymodels various variance covariance structures that control for potential dependency due toclustering effects, while OLS does not ([21], [22], [23], [24],[25]). An additional argumentfavouring the use of LMM is that it more accurately models error terms and controls Type Ierror rates [26].Several models were tested to explore whether growth curves are linear or curvilinear witha two higher-order polynomial models, and if the rate of change in the dependent variable(GHQ) accelerated or decelerated across time. Several variance covariance structures weretested to assess the error covariance structure of the longitudinal data. The intercept and linearslope were permitted to vary across participants (household heads). On the other hand, as tra-jectories of GHQ decline/grow in time (t) can have different slopes and intercepts betweenhouseholds, LMM allows to treat the model coefficients as random (i.e. random slope, randomintercept model).Under the random coefficients modelling framework our model was progressively builtwith explanatory variables accommodating for different variance covariance structures.As the true error structure is usually unknown, some comparing criterion are necessary tocompare between models with different error structures, [20]. A backward stepwise procedurewas adopted to select which variables and their interactions should remain in the final model,starting with a full model incorporating all fixed (with interaction between covariates) and ran-dom effects Decisions as to which variables to retain in the final model and the best variancecovariance structure can be selected either by visual information, or more accurately based oncomparisons of the differences in the Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC) given by (−2 loglikelihood + 2k), as assessed by a chi-square test (p< 0.05), [27].AIC measures the relative fit of competing models with different covariance patterns,where, k is the number of covariance parameters. This method sought to identify the “best”subset of influential factors on GHQ whilst simultaneously removing those variables that wereredundant ([28], [29]). Furthermore, two methods of controlling for continuous confoundingvariables such as AGE were implemented in R; B-splines (bs; Basis for Polynomial Splines)and Natural splines (ns; Basis Matrix for Natural Cubic Splines).Factors affecting psychological well-beingPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198638 June 13, 2018 6 / 14The final model, fit using REML, was assessed using standard model diagnostic tools. Allmixed-effects models were fitted using the “lme” function in “nlme” package in R 3.1.3 [30].The general form of mixed effects model used is:GHQij ¼ ðboo þ b10tij þ b2t2ijÞ|fflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflfflffl}fixed effectþðb0i þ b1itijÞ|fflfflfflfflfflfflffl{zfflfflfflfflfflfflffl}random effectþðb3AGE þ b4AGE2 þ b5AGE3Þ þ b6FISITþ b7FISITX þ b8FIMN þ b9FIMNLþ b10INCOME Ln þ b11XPHSDFþ b12SEX þ b13MASTAT þ b14NKIDSþ b15JBSTAT þ b16QFEDHIþ b17CD All þ b18SEX MASTAT þ εijwhere GHQij is for head of the household (HoH) i, at time (year) j, βoo is the overall GHQmean and b0i is the HoH deviation from this mean, ½b0i  Nð0; s20Þ. Similarly, β10 is the meangrowth/decline rate in GHQ and b1i is the HoH well-being deviation from this growth/declinemean ðb1i  Nð0; s21Þ. ij are independent random errors for each household i and time j,ij  Nð0; s2εÞ.To test a nonlinear growth trajectory across time, other higher-order polynomial trends(i.e., quadratic (β2) was added to the model to improve model fit.The linear slope suggests that the rate of growth/decline remains constant across time (i.e.,a straight line), whereas the higher-order polynomial trends indicate that the growth ratesmight not be the same over time. A quadratic (second-order polynomial) change trajectoryhas no constant common slope (i.e., accelerate/decelerate over time) and consists of a singlestationary point (i.e., peak/trough).AGE, FISIT, FISITX, FIMN, FIMNL, INCOME, XPHSDF, SEX, MASTAT, NKIDS,JBSTAT, QFEDHI and CD_All are the covariates (defined above), which included in themodel to evaluate their effect on the GHQ. β3,β5,. . .,β17 are the covariates coefficients respec-tively. Interaction between time and the potential predictors and confounding factors andinteraction between SEX and Martial Status (MASTAT, β18) were also included in the modelto test whether their effect varied across time points.For identifying the most appropriate covariance structure, several possible autocorrelationstructures were considered AR1, corARMA or moving average autocorrelation. Model selec-tion based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used. corARMA covariance structureswere selected and specified the best to our model based on AIC. Visual inspection of residualplots did not reveal any serious deviations from distributional assumptions, indicating that thefitted Linear Mixed Model was appropriate.ResultsThe best model (Table 4) was selected based on a stepwise selection retaining only the signifi-cant factors using the best variance covariance structure corARMA. In choosing the bestmode, preference was given on smaller AIC values and fewer number of parameters to be esti-mated (parsimony). Striking a balance between these two aspects, a conditional polynomialmodel with heterogeneous corARMA(q = 3) covariance structure was found to be more appro-priate for describing the growth/decline profile of GHQ.The estimates of intercept, slope and quadratic slope of model were found to be significantand more realistic, with p-values less than 0.001.The analysis suggests that, AGE, FISIT, FISITX, XPHSDF, SEX, MASTAT, NKIDS,QFEDHI and JBSTAT were significantly associated with GHQ. While FIMN, FIMNL,INCOME and CD_All were not found to be significantly associated with GHQ as illustrated inTable 4.Factors affecting psychological well-beingPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198638 June 13, 2018 7 / 14The estimate of the model intercept is 2.215, (SE = 0.006), and the slope (average changeeach year) is 2.722, (SE = 0.707). Both intercept and slop were found to be statistically signifi-cant in the model (p<0.001).Time and time squared had a significant contribution in the model (p < 0.001), meaningthat the effect of time on GHQ is nonlinear. The positive effect of linear growth (β = 2.72) andthe negative effect of the quadratic term (β = -5.32) suggest that there is growth in GHQ scorebut this growth decelerates over time (concave down) (Time effect plot—Fig 1).Random effects (intercept and slope) are also significant with standard deviations of 0.261and 0.011 respectively, confirming that the initial status of the GHQ score and the growth/decline rates cannot be treated as fixed effects over time for each HoH.Table 4.

Our modelling suggests that as financial situation (FISIT) improves, GHQ scores lower(better health). The highest significant decrease in GHQ average score was for those who are“living comfortably or doing alright” (Good) (β = -0.296, p< 0.001), followed by those who“are surviving” (β = -0.194, p< 0.001), when compared to reference category of those who are“finding it difficult” (FISIT plot—Fig 1).Financial expectations a year ahead (FISITX) show a similar trend. Those who expected abetter financial year ahead had significantly less (better) GHQ average score (β = -0.023, p<0.001) than those who expected no change (reference category). Those who expected a deterio-ration in their financial status had higher (poorer) GHQ (β = 0.057, p<0.001) scores comparedto those who expected no change (FISITX effect plot—Fig 1.)Income was not found to be significant and variability in income is explained mostly by jobstatus and financial situations. Income was removed from the model for parsimony while jobstatus and financial situations were included, using prior explained methodology.With respect to demographic covariates; male HoH’s generally had significantly lower(better) GHQ score averages than females (β = -0.071, p<0.001). Age was also found to benonlinear and significant with an increase (deterioration) in GHQ scores until the age ofapproximately 45, then declining until 75 before increasing again (Age effect plot—Fig 1).Number of children (NKIDS) reduced (improved) GHQ scores significantly for HoH’s (β =-0.012, p<0.001) per child.Marital status (MASTAT plot–Fig 1) was also implicated; single HoH’s had a significantlyhigher (poorer) GHQ score (β = 0.017, p<0.001) when compared to married counterpartsTime effect plotTimeGHQ1.931.941.951.96 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20FISIT effect plotFISITGHQ1.901.952.002.052.102.152.20Difficult Good SurvivingFISITX effect plotFISITXGHQ1.941.961.982.002.02AS Better WorseSEX effect plotSEXGHQ1.941.961.982.00F MAGE effect plotAGEGHQ1.901.952.002.052.102.152.20 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100NKIDS effect plotNKIDSGHQ1.821.841.861.881.901.921.941.96 0 2 4 6 8 10MASTAT effect plotMASTATGHQ1.941.951.961.971.981.992.002.01Married Single WDSQFEDHI effect plotQFEDHIGHQ1.931.941.951.961.971.981.992.002.01 No_QF GCSA HFD THNOCJBSTAT effect plotJBSTATGHQ1.952.002.052.102.152.20 Stable Other_LTS TempFig 1.

Widowed, divorced, and separated (WDS) HoH’s also had significantlyhigher GHQ scores than married HoH’s (β = 0.056, p< 0.001).In terms of educational attainment, HFD (β = -0.063), THNOC (β = -0.048) and GCSA(β = -0.030), denoting educated HoH’s, had significantly (p<0.001) lower GHQ scores thanthose with no qualifications (QFEDHI plot–Fig 1).Finally, job status was also significantly (p<0.001) influential with a higher average (poorer)GHQ score for those deemed long term sick (LTS) (β = 0.277) compared to those with stablejobs (reference category). Temporary job holders (TEMP) also had significantly higher(poorer) GHQ scores (β = 0.099, p<0.001), than stable jobs (JBSTAT plot—Fig 1).Strengths and weaknesses• Despite the complexity of fitting Linear mixed model, it is considered the most appropriatemodel for Panel data as it allows to model both the intercept and the slope to be fixed or ran-dom effects.• Linear mixed model the most efficient model used to mode panel data with the most appro-priate variance covariance (correlations between observations).• The only potential weakness is that this analysis does not follow a particular cohort overtime, to investigate the change in the effect to the same cohort.DiscussionWe have demonstrated that both current as well as perceived future expectation of financialstatus have a significant impact on the psychological wellbeing of household heads (HoH’s).Other associated factors which were protective and promoted psychological well-being asdetermined by lower GHQ scores included male gender, married, presence of children, achiev-ing higher educational qualifications and having a stable job.Financial status and male gender have long been associated with mental-wellbeing scoresand our findings are supported by other national level surveys ([31], [32]).Our analysis however raises a nuance; in that current and future expectations of financialstatus are more important than absolute income in determining psychological well-being. Therationale for this could be explained by considering their definitions and connotations. Incomeis an absolute measuruement and is affected by “hard” adjustments such as local taxes anddeductions, adjustments which the invdividual has no control over. Financial status howevercould be argued to be a more holsitic assessment with more individual control.In assessing their financial status, an invidual may also consider additional factors such astheir current or future level of debt or savings, expectations on current and future investments,spending habits and the earning potential of their partner or immediate family. In addition,financial status could also include “soft” influences such as perceived standard of living, futureexpenditure plans, and ability to afford what is desired (living comfortably). Furthermore, dif-ferences in life experiences may also impact financial status; those who have experienced previ-ous hardships, either during childhood or adolesence may find that their current and futureprospects are much better than what they have previously experienced, whereas those whohave perhaps had much higher expectations previously may feel that they deserve more. Fur-thermore, an individuals percpetion of how much financial success matters as an indication ofsuccess can not be ignored, indeed, previous work has suggested that strong aspirations forfinancial success, to such an extent that it predominates over other life goals, has been associ-ated with various pscyhological issues [33].Factors affecting psychological well-beingPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198638 June 13, 2018 10 / 14The implications are that consideration of income only when analysing financial effects onindividuals is a crude measure at best, and erroenous at worst. Human perception of the worldis defined by their perception of the future coloured with their experiences of the past, hencethe use of a more holsitic variable which takes these into account would be a more appropriatemethod of analyisng financial effects.Our findings also support previous work which demonstrate that marriage or the presenceof a partner improve psychological wellbeing. Wilson and Oswald [34] in their longitudinalreview of the impact of marriage on both physical and psychological health concluded thatmarriage reduced the risk of psychological illness and makes people happier and healthier.Interestingly they also concluded that although both partners enhjoy the benefits, there is evi-dence to show men may gain more than women, which could offer partial explanation of whymen have better psychological well being scores.Our results also show that the presence of children positively affects psychological wellbe-ing. The recent evidence in this area which demonstrates a relatively equivocal position with aslight predisposition towards a positive effect. The current concensus is that the effect of chil-dren is life-stage dependant and addtionally that it is not simply the number of children thatare important, but rather the quality of the relationship between the child and their parentsthat influences parental psychological well-being [35]. Child age also appears to be an impor-tant factor, with parents of younger children reporting generally better psychological well-being scores [36]. Explanations range from the increasing autonomy of adolescent children[37], to less time spent with parents and questioning of parents rules and practices [38].Job stability and security has also been previously identified to improve mental health andwell-being, both in academic settings and in terms of policy advice [39]. A meta-analysis [40]demonstrated that mental health, as well as physical health, is significantly impacted by jobinsecurity. The authors argue that this finding is not surprising given that the anticipation of afundamental and unwanted event (becoming unemployed in this case) is a source of psycho-logical strain, and fits with the cnetral assumptions of stress theory.Separatrely, De Witte [41] found that although job insecurity was a significant risk factorfor psychological wellbeing in men, it was not so in women, offering poitential explanationsusing role theory and family situation, although noting that the limited number of women par-ticipants in the sutdy did not allow for meaningful conclusions.Treating job security and insecurity as binary states and therefore applying the respectiveeffects they have on psychological wellbeing as discrete events is also not appropriate. In theirreview of chronic job insecurity, Ferrie et al [42] showed that the psychological issues relatingto periods of job insecurity persist even after job security has been regained. This suggests thatthe anxiety and stress associated with job insecurity is not easily forgotten, and that those whohave experienced job insecurity, may always at some level be expecting to expeirence it again.ConclusionThis paper makes a several novel contributions to the literature. First and foremost, we haveprovided further evidence on the relationship between wellbeing and financial situation. Cleareffects of the impact of financial situation on wellbeing for both men and women as the headof a household has been found. These results conform to the general literature, although thispaper has explored a number of new points which we outline below.We have demonstrated that the size of the income is not directly associated with wellbeing,while the financial situation and other controls have been accounted for in the model.Perception of current and future financial situation and the prospect of a stable job is muchmore important than the size of the income on wellbeing.Factors affecting psychological well-beingPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198638 June 13, 2018 11 / 14We have highlighted a number of other factors which directly related to wellbeing; such asgender, age, education, number of children and marital status.In term of the modelling several robust linear mixed models with linear or curvilineargrowth curve methods and smoothing splines have been explored.Interactions between factors affecting wellbeing are considered to assess whether importantconfounding factors are potentially being different for different groups.The employed models accounted for individual heterogeneity and explored different pat-terns in order to produce far richer results by controlling for wellbeing dynamics.Author ContributionsConceptualization: G.
