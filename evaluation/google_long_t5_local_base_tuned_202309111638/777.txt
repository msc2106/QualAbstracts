ABSTRACT: 
This paper reports the findings of a study that presented bi-modal audio-visual stimuli (video footage), to experimental subjects under controlled conditions, in order to obtain reliable estimates of perceived wildness, naturalness, felt remoteness and tranquillity. The research extends beyond the literature and demonstrates that unlike tranquillity, wildness appears to be a more intellectual or cognitive construct. However, it does relate well to remoteness and naturalness and is reduced by the presence of mechanical noise. By using the approach previously employed for the development of a Tranquillity Rating Prediction Tool (TRAPT), it has been demonstrated that a similar methodology is also appropriate for wildness. WRAPT (Wildness Rating Prediction Tool) is the first attempt to predict wildness from physical variables, the values of which can be readily obtained from field surveys supplemented by detailed maps where large areas require assessment. The findings of this study will be of interest to those responsible for managing and marketing protected areas such as National Parks, practitioners involved in carrying out landscape character assessments, cartographers wishing to incorporate reliable acoustic data within their vector or raster based stacks and landscape architects involved in designing wild and tranquil spaces across a range of scales.

IntroductionThe progressive decline of Britain’s native woodlands over thelast 3000 years and the establishment of successive layers of cul-tural landscapes have resulted in significant loss of biodiversityacross all trophic levels. This is evidenced by the fact that at the endof the 14th Century apex predators such as the grey wolf and brownbear had vanished, and by the end of the 19th Century England’swoodland cover had dropped to an all-time non-glacial low of <5%(Smith, 2010). This high rate of attrition was acknowledged byHabron (1998), who when writing about the visual perceptions ofScottish landscapes, stated that “in bio-physical terms, there is very∗ Corresponding author.

Watts).little, if any, wildland left in Scotland, as most of the landscape hasbeen altered by human hand or grazing, and what does remain isnow under pressure from recreational activities and the continueddevelopment of forestry”.This analysis applies equally to many of the UK’s more remoteareas where tourism in particular is bringing increasing numbersof visitors in search of ‘natural environments’. In 2010 the Scot-tish Highlands attracted 2.1 million tourists who contributed over£500 million to the Scottish economy. Over half of these visitors(57%) reported the scenery and landscape as being the prime rea-sons for visiting the area (“2011 Scotland Visitor Survey: Regionalresults”). In the case of Dartmoor National Park, which is locatedapproximately 600 miles south of the Scottish Highlands, 2.4 mil-lion tourists contributed over £110 million to the regional economyin 2012 (“National Parks: Facts and Figures”). These figures showthat despite prolonged anthropocentric activity having reduced theBritish landscape to a simplified ecology, the desire of many tohttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.09.0090169-2046/© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Watts / Landscape and Urban Planning 133 (2015) 87–97engage with what are considered to be unspoilt natural environ-ments is strong.The gradual change in our accepted norm of ecological andenvironmental conditions is often referred to as the Shifting Base-line Syndrome. This describes the incremental decline of standardsthat emerge as a result of each new generation lacking knowledgeof the historical condition of their environment. The concept wasfirst elucidated by Pauly (1995) and is useful when attempting tounderstand how and why various visual and acoustic attributescontribute to, or detract from, the perception of environmentalqualities such as wildness or tranquillity. Both of these perceptiveenvironmental characteristics feature on the websites and withinthe Management Plans of each of the UK’s 15 National Parks, wherethey are often referred to as the most valued ‘special qualities’ ofBritish landscapes (Dartmoor National Park, 2007). In fact they areso valued that the UK Government amended the 1995 Environ-ment Act to specifically require all National Park Authorities to“place emphasis on conserving and enhancing the valued attributesof wide open spaces and the wildness and tranquillity perceivedwithin them” (DEFRA, 2010).It is worth noting that the wording used within the literature onremote and natural areas often introduces a degree of confusion bydrawing on descriptors from the English language, such as wilder-ness, which often means different things to different people anddoes not translate uniformly across all dialects. This ambiguity wasrecognised by Scottish Natural Heritage in their Policy Statement02/03 (2003), which specified that “while the term ‘wilderness’is often used to describe the wilder parts of the globe, it is bestavoided within Scotland because it implies a more pristine settingthan we can ever experience in our countryside”. However, in orderto ensure that a polar opposite to wholly urban still exists, they alignwith Habron’s descriptors and use the term ‘wildland’, which theydefine as; “uninhabited and often relatively inaccessible country-side, where the influence of human activity on the character andquality of the environment has been minimal”, and ‘wildness’ as theperceptive quality that such places are measured by. This descriptoris conceptually easier to handle than terms such as ‘untrammelled’,which underpins the definition of wilderness in the USA’s 1964Wilderness Act. The terms wildland and wildness have thereforebeen applied throughout this paper and for reference have beenincluded along with other key concepts in the Glossary of termsSupplemental file.Previous qualitative studies into how wild spaces are charac-terised, such as Australia’s National Wilderness Inventory (2003),have focussed on a set of generally accepted attributes of wild-ness that relate to perceived levels of remoteness and naturalness(Lesslie, Taylor, & Maslen, 1993). The degree of naturalness of ascene is broadly associated with vegetation and water, plus theamount of human-induced change present (Ode, Tveit, & Fry, 2008).Vegetation quality is judged by the percentage of natural veg-etation present within the visual scene and its shape, level ofsuccession, and the extent to which it conforms with traditionalland use of the environment being appraised. The visual scale anddegree of disturbance to both the landscape and the vegetation alsocontributes to perceived naturalness. Scale provides the observerwith information about size, shape, diversity, openness and avail-ability of resources, all of which are components of Appleton’sProspect-Refuge-Theory (1975), whereas disturbance allows theunity (coherence) of the scene to be gauged. The spatial arrange-ment of water within the scene and some idea or imagined ideal ofwhat a traditional landscape may have looked like are also deemedto be important elements in the naturalness construct. Remotenessis simply taken to mean the distance from places of permanentoccupation or established access routes.Naturalness and remoteness were used by Carver, Comber,McMorran, and Nutter (2012) on behalf of Scottish NaturalHeritage (SNH), to underpin the development of a GIS modeldesigned to map wildland contours across Scotland. As part ofthe project a uni-modal perception study was also carried out(SNH, 2012) to derive weighting factors for use within the model.This study employed photographs and a questionnaire to illicitresponses from a large sample of volunteers. The results showedthe presence of wildlife and noticeable geological and geographicalfeatures within the landscape (such as cliff faces and boulder fields)to be additional ‘natural’ elements that significantly contributed tothe perception of wildness. Conversely built up areas, energy infra-structure (such as pylons, wind turbines and dams) and recreationalinfrastructure (such as four-wheel-drive tracks, hiking paths, skilifts, and evidence of hunting), all influenced the visual perceptionof wildness in a negative way. These human artefacts introduce anelement of visual discontinuity within the landscape that can resultin a perceived lack of contextual coherence (i.e. the human arte-facts can be perceived to be out of context). Elements within thelandscape (and soundscape) that disturb the observer’s affiliationwith nature are also deemed to be out of context. This is especiallythe case if they conflict with the natural, cultural and historicalrichness of the environment or accepted stewardship practices.Within this study contextual features have been defined as:man-made elements within the landscape (and soundscape) thatdo not disrupt the human affiliation with nature. When combinedwith the definition of naturalness provided in the Glossary of terms,the objective measure of ‘natural and contextual features’ (NCF)present within the visual scene can be determined.From what has been said above it can be appreciated that visualscene perception involves utilising information from the globalproperties of the visual world, rather than simply from singleobjects located within it. Thus a wild land may for example con-sist of water, rocks and birds, but it only becomes a wild place oncecontext is applied. This happens when the brain groups each of thecomponents together and then seeks an existing contextual tem-plate (schemata) against which to compare them to. Kaplan andKaplan (1989) referred to this context as configurational coherence,and simplified the term by explaining that it related to “the degreeto which a scene hangs together”. However, this is only part of theprocess, as our senses evolved to compensate for the weaknesses ofeach other, thereby enabling us to characterise our environment onmore than just a uni-modal sensory input. Therefore in situationswhere no schemata exist to account for contextual discontinuity,additional senses are brought on-line to try and resolve the ambi-guity. In the first instance this tends to fluctuate between visionand audition, until context of the sensory information receivedenables an environment to be adequately described. Thereforewhat we hear (or expect to hear) is a fundamental part of landscapecharacterisation. This is defined here as; the process by which anindividual uses sensory cues, their previous experiences, and theirknowledge of biological, natural and man-made indicators, to makea judgement on how to describe a location.Landscape character assessment methodologies within theUK, rarely incorporate objective acoustic measures within theirappraisals (Countryside Agency, 2002) of what Gobster, Nassauer,Daniel, and Fry (2007) describe as the ‘scenic aesthetic’ (i.e. land-scape scenery). This is despite a growing body of scientific evidencethat supports the argument that the perceptive process of environ-mental characterisation is much more than a uni-modal sensoryconstruct. In fact, research involving brain scanning (fMRI) carriedout by the University of Sheffield, has clearly shown audio-visualinteraction to be a fundamental component of environmental per-ception, in particular the cognitive construction of tranquil space(Hunter et al., 2010).The fact that wildness and tranquillity are frequently mentionedtogether within the management plans and marketing materialof National Parks, and with policies related to the managementR.J.

If that is the case, then it seems reasonable toassume that a modified version of the Tranquillity Rating Predic-tion Tool (TRAPT) proposed by Pheasant, Horoshenkov, and Watts(2010), which uses the day time equivalent sound level (Lday, seeTable 1) and the percentage of natural and contextual featuresvisible within the landscape, could use bi-modal variables to accu-rately predict mean perceived wildness of an environment. Unlessof course the perception of wildness is a less intuitive constructthan tranquillity, or vice versa.The aim of this paper is to report the findings of a study that useda new and unique dataset to determine how audition and visioninteract as they affect perception of wildness and tranquillity. Thenovelty of the study lies in the fact that it considers both landscapeand soundscape characteristics in order to measure the wildness ofenvironments, rather than visual properties alone. The hypothesesbeing tested are that naturalness and remoteness would correlatewell with wildness, but not so much with tranquillity; and thatwildness is typically a more cognitive construct than tranquillity,naturalness and remoteness. It is anticipated that the findings ofthis study will be of use to those responsible for managing andmarketing protected areas such as National Parks; those seekingto develop re-wilding strategies similar to the Wild Nephin projectin Ireland’s Ballycroy National Park; practitioners involved in car-rying out landscape character assessments; cartographers wishingto incorporate reliable acoustic data within their vector or rasterbased stacks; and landscape architects involved in designing wildand tranquil spaces across a range of scales.2. Methods2.1. Data collectionDuring the summer of 2012, audio-visual data was capturedfrom 16 locations across England and Scotland using a Canon XM2 camcorder to record the visual information and a Bruel and Kjær(B&K) 2250 Sound Level Metre (SLM) to record the auditory andacoustic data. The locations chosen for the study were selected fromthe Scottish Highlands, Dartmoor National Park and West York-shire, as they provided a representative sample of environmentsthat ranged from wholly urban, to completely free of any obvioushuman influence. This spectrum is often referred to as the wildlandcontinuum (Fisher et al., 2010) and includes the urban fringe, agri-cultural land, semi-natural and natural environments, between theleast wild (wholly urban) and most wild (wildland) end points. Dur-ing filming the camcorder was swept from left to right over a 1 minrecording period, 30 s of which settled on the central view. At thesame time the associated soundscape was recorded as a WAV file onthe SLM, which was calibrated in the field using a B&K 4231 94 dB(1 kHz) sound calibrator. The advantage of recording the sound-scape on the sound level metre was that simultaneous objectiveacoustic measures for the metrics described in Table 1 were alsotaken. A-weighted filters have been used as they cover the audiorange 20–20 kHz and have a response similar to that of the humanear.2.2. Data editingOnce the visual and audio information was transferred to a PC itwas edited using Adobe Premiere 6.5 software and each audio filewas imported and reconciled with its corresponding visual scene.The decision was then taken to either present each of the locationswith just the 30 s central view or with the 120◦ panorama. Thedeciding factor lay in whether the peripheral visual informationprovided any additional contextual information to the central shot.Based on this criterion, the final data set included five environmentsthat covered 120◦ and eleven that used only the central shot. In bothcases the presented stimuli lasted for approximately 30 s (±2) asper the exposure time reported by Pheasant, Horoshenkov, Watts,and Barrett (2008).The bi-modal stimuli used within the study consisted of fifteenlocations presented in the following three different experimentalconditions:(1) As recorded in situ (referred to ‘as is’)(2) With enhanced mechanical soundscape components added(referred to as ‘enhanced mechanical’)(3) With enhanced biological or natural soundscape componentsadded (referred to as ‘enhanced biological or natural’)A recording of a congested main road in the Devonshire village ofModbury was also included. This was left un-edited and used as thecontrol stimuli, as wildness and tranquillity ratings were expectedto be close to zero.When each location was edited to incorporate additional biolog-ical and mechanical sounds care was taken to ensure that the addedcomponents were in context with the environment in which theywere being presented. The biological sounds were downloadedfrom the British Library and were originally recorded close to thelocation that they were added to. For example, the sounds of agolden eagle mewing that were overlaid on the soundscape of GlenEtive in Scotland, were recorded close to where the footage for thisstudy was taken, as were the sounds of birds and insects that wereoverlaid on the footage of mixed farmland within the DartmoorNational Park. A similar approach was taken when adding mechan-ical noise to the original recordings, with an emphasis on locationalcongruence rather than on standardised effect.Fig. 1 shows the central view of the sixteen locations used in thestudy along with a description of the key soundscape componentscontained in each of the experimental conditions in the order: ‘asis’, ‘enhanced mechanical’ and ‘enhanced biological or natural’.Alongside each experimental condition is the LAeq of that par-ticular stimuli and the amount (±dB) that it differs from the ‘as is’condition. The supplemental links for Glen Etive, River Nevis, HayTor, Modbury, Great Mis Tor and Ovenden Moor, provide examplesof the audio recordings used in the three experimental conditions.These six locations have been selected as they cover the broadspectrum of the wildland continuum presented within the study.Once the editing of the video tracks was complete, the resulting46 stimuli (i.e. 15 environments × 3 experimental conditions + 1control environment), were each placed in random order and thenturned into a video stream that was copied onto a DVD. This wholeprocess was repeated twice more to enable three uniquely ordered90 R.J. Pheasant, G.R. Watts / Landscape and Urban Planning 133 (2015) 87–97Fig. 1. Introduction to the locations used in the study and their soundscape attributes. Supplemental mp3 files have been included for those locations marked with anasterisk.DVDs to be produced. An additional ‘introduction and practice’ DVDwas also compiled that contained slides explaining the purpose ofthe experiment and the terminology and graphical representationsused to describe the variables being measured. It also containedfive video clips of contrasting stimuli that were not included in themain dataset.2.3. ProcedureTwenty one subjects (10 female and 11 male) took part in theexperiment. Their average age was 38 years (±15.7 years) and theirages ranged from 38 to 71 years. All of the subjects arrived as ‘naïve’volunteers and each was rewarded with a £15 store voucher.The experiment was conducted in a soundproof psychoacousticsuite with the volunteers sitting in pairs wearing ROLAND RH-300stereo headphones. These had been calibrated using the 94 dB 1 kHzcalibration tone recorded in the field, to ensure that the audio datawas presented at the same level that it was recorded. For each loca-tion shown on the Pioneer (PDP-506XDE) plasma screen, which wasattached to a Samsung R125-DVD player, the subjects awarded ascore of 0–10, with 0 being least and 10 being most, for the fol-lowing bi-modal environmental attributes: wildness; tranquillity;naturalness; and felt remoteness. They also used Self-assessmentManikins (SAM) to indicate their emotional reaction to the environ-ment being shown in terms of: pleasantness; calmness; and control(Fig. 2).The use of SAMs is a non-verbal pictorial assessment techniquedevised by Hades, Cook, and Lang (1985) that directly measuresthe pleasure, arousal, and dominance associated with a person’saffective reaction to a wide variety of stimuli. These three emo-tional dimensions are known to be pervasive in organising humanjudgements (Bradley & Lang, 1994). The advantage of using SAMsas opposed to Semantic Differential (SD) for example, is that theranked pictures can be quickly interpreted with little error across awide range of age groups and cultures. It therefore fitted well withthe limited time that the subjects had to record their scores on theresponse sheets provided.Prior to the experiment commencing the subjects viewed theintroduction and practice DVD which contained a detailed expla-nation of the variables being measured and of the experimentalprocedure. Wildness was explained to relate to how free fromhuman control or manipulation an area appears to be (ScottishNatural Heritage, 2003) and tranquillity was defined as “how peace-ful and attractive a place is perceived to be, i.e. the extent towhich it is considered to be a place to get away from every-day life” (Herzog & Barnes, 1999). In relation to naturalness theR.J. Pheasant, G.R. Watts / Landscape and Urban Planning 133 (2015) 87–97 91Fig. 2. The Self-assessment Manikins (SAM) used to illicit emotional responses.subjects were instructed to consider the following key indicators:the naturalness of the vegetation; landscape patterns; visual scale;the degree of human-induced change present; and the overall unityof the scene. They were also encouraged to draw upon whateverother value judgements they considered appropriate.In previous wildness perception studies (Scottish NaturalHeritage, 2012) it has not been uncommon for participants to strug-gle when assessing how remote a location is perceived to be, despitebeing provided with guiding information, such as distance to thenearest road or railway station. This is arguably because these stud-ies have used uni-modal stimuli, i.e. photographs to stimulate aresponse, rather than a more immersive auditory-visual dataset.In the introduction and practice DVD, the concept of ‘felt remote-ness’ was introduced to the subjects. This is an adaptation of ‘feltintensity’, which is used to explain the intangible sensitivities tocertain components of the urban environment (Massey, Allen, &Pile, 1999).Due to the high probability that ‘felt remoteness’ would be anunfamiliar concept, the subjects were instructed that they shouldrate it based on how far from civilization the auditory and visualinformation made them feel for each location presented. They werealso told that for the purpose of this experiment the term civi-lization should be taken to mean populated areas, or well usedtransportation routes, such as main roads and railway stations thatservice such areas.It was acknowledged during the experimental design phase thatthere would be a degree of uncertainty in the validity and reliabilityof the ratings attributed to the felt remoteness variable. However,it was included in the experiment as there was an assumption thatthe additional information provided by an auditory input that wascongruent to the visual scene, would provide key information inrelation to distance and therefore remoteness. Distance being thenoun that the adjective remoteness describes.When introducing the SAMs to the subjects it was verballyexplained that calmness was being used as a proxy for arousal,and that it referred to how various auditory and visual componentswithin the presented stimuli raised levels of alertness and excite-ment. Pleasantness was considered to be an intuitive construct andthe subjects were simply asked to score each environment on howpleasant or unpleasant they found it to be. No other guidance wasprovided to the subjects on rating calmness and pleasantness. Con-trol, which was used as a proxy for dominance, was slightly moreproblematic to explain to the volunteers and to apply to environ-mental quality appraisal. This may well be because it is used tomeasure interaction-structured situations and stimuli, rather thanpassive activities, such as viewing and listening to landscapes. Theparticipants were instructed to rate control on the extent to whichthey felt that they were either in control of the environment beingassessed or controlled by it in some way. To illustrate this point theywere asked to consider the extent to which a busy road or the pres-ence of a dangerous animal within their immediate environmentmight influence how ‘in control’ or ‘controlled’ they felt.Once these points had been covered and all questions answered,the subjects were asked to complete a practice exercise. Thisincluded five 30 s video tracks that showed a range of environmentsthat differed to those being used in the actual experiment. Duringthe first presentation of these environments the subjects were sim-ply introduced to the stimuli and not required to make any qualityevaluations. Whilst viewing the five environments for the secondtime, they were asked to score them on perceived wildness, tran-quillity, naturalness and felt remoteness. Then during the third andfinal exposure to the stimuli they were required to include theiremotional responses to calmness, pleasantness and control. Theintroduction and practice session lasted approximately 20 min andwas followed by a 10 min break.During the experiment the subjects were shown 3 DVDs thatcontained 15 locations in each of the 3 experimental conditions,plus the 1 control location in the ‘as is’ condition only. EachDVD therefore contained 46 video clips. DVD 1 included 15 s gapsbetween each location presented to allow subjects enough timeto record their responses. The 2nd and 3rd DVDs had 10 s gapsbetween each video clip. All subjects were shown DVD 1 first andgiven the choice which of the remaining two DVDs they wanted toview next. Due to the length of this experiment, all subjects weregiven a second 10 min comfort break between the final two DVDs.Only results from the second and third presentations of each videoset were used in the final analysis.At the end of the experiment, after all 3 DVDs had beenshown, subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire thatqueried which visual and auditory components of the stimuli mostenhanced and detracted from their perception of wildness andremoteness. It was not necessary to ask these questions in rela-tion to tranquillity as this has been well established in previousstudies (Herzog & Bosely, 1992; Watts, Pheasant, & Horoshenkov,2011). Fig. 3 summaries the process and timeline followed in thisexperiment.2.4. Objective measuresThe WAV files used to introduce ‘enhanced mechanical’ and‘enhanced biological or natural’ soundscape components to eachof the environments presented were analysed by a specially writ-ten Matlab code that enabled their A-weighted sound levels to becalculated. This was achieved by comparing them against the cali-bration tones that were recorded onto the sound level metre in thefield. This process showed an acceptable maximum error of ±0.5 dB.The interpretation of naturalness and context provided in theintroduction was used to determine the percentage of natural andcontextual features (NCF) within each of the visual scenes. These92 R.J. Pheasant, G.R. Watts / Landscape and Urban Planning 133 (2015) 87–97Fig. 3. Flow diagram of the experimental procedure produced in Word.were derived using the methodology described in Pheasant et al.(2008) by pasting the landscape images into PowerPoint and over-laying a 10 × 10 grid. The areas covered by natural and contextualfeatures were estimated by counting the number of squares occu-pied by each and interpolating where necessary. The area of skyabove the horizon was not used in the calculation of NCF as slightchanges in camera angle have the potential to bias the measure-ment. If N is the area with natural and contextual features and Mthe total area of man-made features then NCF is given by:NCF =100NN + M(1)For the purpose of calculating the percentage of wildland withinthe visual scene, elements of human-induced change such as plan-tations, or other overt acts of stewardship that disrupted the unityof the scene, were subtracted from N in Eq. (2), yielding the areaof wildland W. Contextual features were not included within thiscalculation as the measure is applied to human artefacts withinthe landscape and does not fit with the notion of wildness. Thepercentage of wild land (%W) was therefore given by:%W =100WN + M(2)2.5. AnalysisMicrosoft Excel 2010 was used to collate the ratings awardedto each of the experimental variables (wildness, tranquillity, nat-uralness, felt remoteness, calmness, pleasantness and control) foreach of the 46 environments presented and to perform a repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). This was carried outin order to confirm that the values for the dependent variables(wildness and tranquillity) obtained in the three treatments weresufficiently different to each other. Excel was also used to carry outa Pearson correlation analysis between the mean ratings awardedby the subjects (for each of the landscape attributes and emotionalresponses listed above); and the objectively derived measures.These were the acoustic metrics listed in Table 1, the percentageof natural and contextual features present within the visual sceneand the percentage of land calculated as being ‘wild’.IBM SPSS Statistics 20 was used to perform stepwise linearregression analysis to identify the combination of independentvariables that provided the highest coefficient of determina-tion (adjusted R2) and the highest significance (P-value) for thedependent variables wildness and tranquillity. It was also used toperform simultaneous linear regression analysis to establish therelationship between the acoustic metric LAeq and the emotionalresponses for calmness, pleasantness and control, and to developtwo theoretical models for predicting wildness that utilised objec-tively derived data.3. Results3.1. Analysis of VarianceThe results of the repeated measures ANOVA contained inTable 2 show that the video clips presented in each of the threeexperimental conditions (‘as is’, enhanced mechanical sounds andenhanced biological or natural sounds) were significantly differentto each other (P < 0.00), for both perceived wildness and perceivedtranquillity. They also show that the results for perceived tran-quillity contained a much higher degree of variance across allconditions than the results obtained for wildness, thereby suggest-ing that tranquillity and wildness are indeed separate perceptiveconstructs. The difference in variance may be explained by the factthat LAeq is known to be a strong factor within the construction oftranquil space and that the locations showing the greatest degreeof variance (Great Mis Tor, Highland railway and the A38 trunkroad), all contained relatively high levels of mechanical noise in theenhanced experimental condition that may have been interpretedby some of the subjects as being ambiguous, or out of context withthe visual scene being presented. This was certainly the case forone individual who mistakenly interpreted the call of an unseenrutting stag, introduced as ‘enhanced biological or natural sounds’to the scene of the highland railway, as the roar of a lion.3.2. Pearson correlation analysisThe results of the Pearson correlation analysis which are con-tained in Table 3 identified that average perceived wildness iswell correlated with perceived naturalness, felt remoteness andthe emotional response pleasantness, but less so to calmness andcontrol and to sound levels. It also showed that tranquillity is wellrelated to naturalness and felt remoteness but much more so to theemotional reactions of pleasantness, calmness and control and tothe acoustic indices LAeq, LA10 and LA90, explanations of whichare provided in Table 1.3.3. Stepwise linear regression analysisWhen all of the results were analysed using stepwise linearregression analysis the independent variables that resulted in thehighest observed coefficient of determination (adjusted R2) andhighest significance (P-values) for the dependent variable wild-ness were: perceived felt remoteness; perceived naturalness; andthe percentage of wildland contained within the visual scene. Inthe case of tranquillity the emotional responses for calmness andperceived naturalness, and the measured LAeq were all shown tobe significant factors. These results, which are contained in Table 4,indicate that visual information plays a stronger role in both con-structs than auditory information and that wildness is potentially amore cognitive (i.e. more analytical) construct than tranquillity asit draws almost as much on perceived ‘felt remoteness’ as it does onperceived ‘naturalness’. Care was taken within this statistical testto reduce bias by including as small a set of predictor variables aspossible.3.4. Simultaneous linear regression analysisIn order to understand the extent to which objectively derivedauditory and visual measurements were able to predict wildness,simultaneous linear regression analysis was carried out using LAeqR.J.

The same test was also conducted toassess whether LAeq and the percentage of natural and contex-tual (man-made) features present agreed with the equation usedwithin the Tranquillity Rating Prediction Tool (TRAPT). The resultsare contained in Table 5.From Table 5 it can be seen that that the percentage of wild landcontained within the visual scene and the A-weighted equivalentsound level (LAeq) are both significant factors in predicting wild-ness at the 95% confidence level. The mid-range adjusted R2 valueof 0.52 may be attributable to a missing variable, such as the dis-tance from the nearest conurbation or access route, or it may be afunction of the relatively small sample size used within the study.In the case of tranquillity the relationship between LAeq andNCF was shown to be similar to the values used in the Tranquil-lity Rating Prediction Tool, where the Tranquillity Rating equaled9.86 + 0.041 NCF − 0.146 LAeq. The mid-range adjusted R2 for thismeasure is likely to be a result of the landscape types being assessedand the relatively low degree of soft fascination contained withinthe scenery. This is known to be an essential component of thetranquillity construct and is a lower state of arousal than directedattention. Within this study directed attention within the percep-tion of tranquillity is most likely to have been elevated by severalof the edited mechanical and biological soundscape components.3.5. Effects of enhanced soundscapesThe addition of mechanical noise resulted in an averagedecreased wildness rating of 0.9 of a point within the 0 (leastwild)–10 (most wild) range. The greatest effect however, wasobserved on the perception of tranquillity, where ratings werereduced by up to −3.5 points within the 0–10 scale. The addition ofbiological and natural sounds made a small but significant increasein wildness ratings of 0.3 of a wildness point, but had no signifi-cant effect on perceived tranquillity. These findings are supportedby the results of the ANOVA reported in Section 3.1.Interestingly, the greatest influence of enhanced mechanicalnoise on all the subjective ratings did not relate to the envi-ronment that had the highest LAeq (80.5 dB), which emanatedfrom a low flying aircraft, but from two short bursts of automaticweapon fire. These came from a military firing range within theDartmoor National Park (Great Mis Tor) and at 63.5 dB(A) were17.0 dB(A) lower than the aircraft mentioned above. Kang (2006)provides some insight into this apparent acoustic contradiction byexplaining that in comparison to visual information, sound, whichis ubiquitous, is very often information-poor but emotion-rich.Thereby adding strength to the theory that perceived environmen-tal characterisation relies on multi-modal, rather than uni-modalinformation. It also relies on cognitive categories of noise, ratherthan just objective measures of such. The enhanced mechanicalnoise that most detracted from the feeling of remoteness, was adistant ambulance siren that was presented with a recording ofHangershell Tor. This location is also situated within the DartmoorNational Park and lies approximately 2 miles from the nearest road.The introduction of the siren, which although low at 44.6 dB(A) wasstill 10 dB(A) higher than the original (‘as is’) sound level, degradedthe feeling of isolation by 3.3 points on the 0–10 point scale.When the ‘as is’ environments that were rated the highest interms of wildness, tranquillity, naturalness, felt remoteness, plea-sure, calmness and control are examined, it becomes apparentthat they also have a higher rating once congruent biological ornatural sounds have been added. However, the amount of improve-ment in overall perceived environmental quality is limited, perhapsbecause each of these qualities is already rated very highly. Therecording of Glen Etive in the Scottish Highlands enhanced withbiological or natural sounds (birdsong) (see Fig. 1) was the environ-ment rated as being ‘most wild’. Subjects rated it as 8.3 (mean) in the‘as is’ condition, but this rose to a mean of 8.7 once enhanced bio-logical or natural sounds had been added, which was an increase inperceived wildness of (+0.4). This ‘as is’ location was also assessed asbeing the most: tranquil (9.1), natural (9.1), pleasant (4.7) and calm(4.8), of all the locations and experimental conditions presented inthe data set. Note that the SAM rating methodology uses a 5 pointscale, as opposed to the 11 point scale used for the assessment ofwildness, tranquillity, naturalness and felt remoteness.The location assessed as feeling the most remote, was a viewof moorland on the Corrour Estate in the Scottish Highlands thatextended over 15 km. This was recorded 20 km from the nearestroad (but only 5 km from Corrour Station), and when presentedwith enhanced biological noise was rated as 9.2. Although this wasonly an increase of 0.2 on the ‘as is’ assessment, it reflects howtransitory noises are continually processed within auditory sceneanalysis, to enable the brain to perceptually construct as much envi-ronmental context as possible. The biological sound added to thislocation was the distant mewing of an unseen buzzard which lastedfor no more than 2 s.3.6. LAeq versus the emotional responsesWhen the emotional responses calmness, pleasantness andcontrol were regressed against LAeq (Table 6), the sound levelwas shown to be a significantly negative factor in all threeemotional measures. When the emotional responses were testedtogether against the dependent variables, wildness and tranquil-lity, only calmness and pleasantness were highly significant factors(P < 0.001). For both wildness and tranquillity, control fell a longR.J. Pheasant, G.R.

This may well be becausecontrol is an ambiguous concept to apply to passively viewedscenes and it is potentially not considered to be relevant, or perhapsit was not well understood by the subjects.3.7. Questionnaire analysisFurther insight into how the subjects rated the environmentscan be obtained from a review of the questionnaire results. Theseshowed that the two visual components that contributed mostto the perception of wildness were: the lack of man-made influ-ence (24%) and the presence of wide open spaces with distantviews (24%). The two soundscape components that contributedthe most to the perception of wildness were biological noisesand running water. The visual detractors of wildness were traffic(39%) and energy infrastructure (pylons and wind turbines) (26%),whereas transportation noise (65%) and gunfire (15%) accountedfor the least favourable soundscape components. When assessing‘felt remoteness’ the subjects stated that wide open spaces withdistant views (24%) and a total lack of man-made features (22%)were the most important visual factors. Nearly half of the respon-dents (43%) reported that silence or “extreme quiet” enhanced thefeeling of remoteness the most and 22% stated that low levels ofbiological noise had the greatest influence.3.8. Developing a Wildness Rating Prediction ToolThe negative impact of noise upon the perception of both wild-ness and tranquillity has been a recurring theme throughout theanalysis of the results from this study. The hypothesis that it is theLAeq of ‘man-made’ noise rather than naturally occurring sounds,and the percentage of wildland visually present within the scenethat informs the wildness construct, is confirmed. It is thereforepossible to propose a Wildness Rating Prediction Tool (WRAPT).This follows the approach taken by Pheasant et al. (2010) in thedevelopment of TRAPT. Within the application of the proposedWRAPT, it is anticipated that levels of man-made noise will be neg-atively correlated to the wildness rating and that the percentageof wildland in the landscape would be positively related. There-fore, in order to mathematically account for the negative impactsof mechanical noise, a default value for all environments where onlynatural sounds are perceptible was determined. For all other envi-ronments, i.e. those where man-made noise predominates, LAeq isFig. 4. Predicted wildness versus Lday.used. The default value chosen was based on a very low level of26 dB(A) recorded on the Corrour Estate over a 90 s period duringthe field study. This recording was not used within the video clipspresented to the subjects as it contained no perceptible environ-mental information. The findings of this pilot study suggest thatthe 26 dB(A) default value can be applied to natural environments,such as raging rivers that have a very high LAeq, as these environ-ments were rated highly by subjects for wildness, regardless of thesound level presented within the video clip. This is evidenced bythe River Dart, which in the ‘as is’ experimental condition had amean wildness rating of 7.7 despite the 71.7 dB LAeq recorded atthis location.By regressing wildness with the percentage of the landscapemeasured as wild (%W) and LAeq values that included the 26 dBdefault for wholly natural soundscapes, the regression equationcontained in Table 7 was obtained.Fig. 4 shows how the predicted wildness rating changes asa function of the average noise level for various percentages ofwildland within the landscape. It can be observed that highernoise levels decrease wildness ratings, whereas the greater thepercentage of wild land presents the higher the rating. The formof the WRAPT equation being proposed is similar to that of TRAPT,which links tranquillity ratings with noise levels and the percent-age of natural and contextual features present (see Eq. (1)). Notethat for practical purposes it is recommended that Lday, which is96 R.J. Pheasant, G.R.

It can be seen that the simpleregression line has a slope close to 1 and when this is extrapolatedit passes close to the origin.4. Discussion4.1. Interpretation of resultsAs expected the correlational analysis revealed that the averagesubjective wildness rating is very closely associated with both ‘nat-uralness’ and ‘felt remoteness’ but much less to noise levels thanthe tranquillity rating. On the other hand wildness is less well cor-related to the emotional responses of pleasantness and calmnessthan tranquillity. It is therefore suggested that wildness is a moreintellectual or cognitive construct than the more affective tranquil-lity concept. Wildness is less related to rated emotional affects andhas a reduced, though important component related to auditoryinputs. Rated wildness and tranquillity were negatively affected byman-made noise but positively influenced by the addition of natu-ral sounds. However, the level of improvement was relatively lowand this may well have been due to the high wildness or tranquil-lity values already attributed to ‘as is’ conditions, leaving little roomfor improvement. It is also likely that those participants that lackedsufficient knowledge to identify some of the natural sounds, suchas the distant call of a rutting deer or the hammering of a wood-pecker, may have found them disturbing or ambiguous. From thedebriefs conducted at the end of each experiment it was clear thatsome of the subjects found insect sounds threatening, especially thebuzzing of bees, and that others were left unsettled by the call ofunseen raptors, such as the buzzard and eagle. However, the ques-tionnaire did identify that these sounds along with extreme quiet,were the auditory factors that most enhanced ‘felt remoteness’.The findings of this research broadly support those found dur-ing the 2012 wildness perception study commission by ScottishNatural Heritage (SNH). In particular they agree with the fourmain wildness attributes put forward i.e. naturalness of land cover,the presence (or not) of man-made structures or features and thedegree of remoteness. However, on the latter point the metric usedwithin this study was ‘felt remoteness’, rather than a physical mea-sure, such as distance to the nearest road or railway station. Thefindings of this study also support the importance of energy infra-structure, i.e. pylons, wind turbines and radio masts, in depressingthe perception of wildness.4.2. LimitationsThis study utilised three experimental conditions, two of whichcontained enhanced acoustic information, in order to determine thekey factors that influenced the perception of wildness and tranquil-lity. It is likely that for some environments this experimental datadid not provide the subjects with sufficient context to the envi-ronment being assessed or that it failed to fit with their existingperceptual schemata. The use of edited stimuli may also partlyexplain why the wildness prediction model, in its current form,fails to reach the maximum achievable score of 10, despite theinput parameters being at the optimum level. This may howeverrelate to the fact that soundscapes dominated by affective qualitiessuch as gunfire and emergency sirens, which showed a significantreduction in all of the variables rated, requires a different measureto LAeq, as it takes no regard of the context of the sound that itis measuring. A limitation of WRAPT therefore is that the model isinsensitive to the context of mechanical sounds, in particular affec-tively discordant ones. It is therefore suggested that the model isapplied in environments that are dominated by noise emitted fromtransportation, including aircraft, and transportation infrastructurerelated activities such as construction and maintenance. Soundsemitting from energy infrastructure, such as wind turbines can alsobe included because of their ‘mechanicalness’. An alternative inter-pretation as to why WRAPT fails to reach its maximum possiblescore is that there is a variable missing from the model, and thestrongest indication is that it most likely relates to an objectivemeasure of a deeper and more robust quality of wildness. Specif-ically this quality might relate to the feeling of remoteness, size,vulnerability and unending naturalness that comes from being inthe type of pristine environments that compelled SNH (2003) toremove the word wilderness from their wildland literature. Noneof the videos used within this research presented data that was col-lected in anything approaching true wilderness environments, andthat is because such environments do not exist within the UnitedKingdom. What they did do however, was present a sample ofBritish landscapes that spanned the limited wildland continuumavailable. This enabled the first Wildness Rating Prediction Tool(WRAPT) for use in the UK to be developed. Note a similar approachcould be used in other countries in order to calibrate the model forlocal conditions.Although the relatively small sample size used is also acknowl-edged as a limitation of this study, there are a reasonable amountR.J. Pheasant, G.R. Watts / Landscape and Urban Planning 133 (2015) 87–97 97of studies published within the psychology and brain research lit-erature that utilise a small number of subjects to produce reliableresults from audio-visual stimuli. This is often the case where lowerlevels of cognitive processing of the stimuli is required, as was thecase in this study, whereas experiments requiring a greater degreeof cognitive effort tend to draw on larger samples to attain reli-able results. Wada, Kitagowa, and Naguschi (2003) and Andersen,Tiippana, and Sams (2004) are two examples of laboratory studiesthat used small sample sizes, 12 and 19 respectively, to produceacceptable results. This provides confidence as to the reliability ofthe results presented here.5. ConclusionsThis research extends beyond the literature by drawing on a richdataset to demonstrate that unlike tranquillity, wildness appearsto be a more intellectual construct. However, it relates well toremoteness and naturalness and is reduced by the presence ofmechanical noise and man-made structures such as energy infra-structure. By using the successful approach previously employedfor the development of a prediction model for tranquillity (TRAPT),it has been demonstrated that a very similar approach workswell for wildness. WRAPT is the first attempt to predict wild-ness from physical variables, the values of which can be readilyobtained from field surveys. Future research into quantifying wild-ness would benefit from using data recorded in the field for eachof the three experimental conditions rather than relying on theuse of edited stimuli and by using a larger sample of respondents.Calibrating the model with the wild land contours developed byCarver et al. and used by Scottish Natural Heritage could poten-tially help revise and thereby strengthen the model. Understandingthe importance of monetary trade-offs within the provision andprotection of wild land within the UK is also an area that has yetto be adequately investigated. For full landscape assessments it issuggested that both the WRAPT and TRAPT models are used, inorder to obtain an overall assessment of these particular landscapequalities.AcknowledgementsWe wish to acknowledge the support given to this studyby: Mr Dave Melling of Bradford Metropolitan DistrictCouncil for assistance in collecting the field data, Profes-sor Abigail Bristow from Loughborough University for herbalanced critique of the manuscript and Professor KirillHoroshenkov of the University of Sheffield for his expert acousticanalysis.Appendix A.
