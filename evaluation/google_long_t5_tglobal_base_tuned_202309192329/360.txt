ABSTRACT: 
Although dramatically reduced in Western and developed countries, maternal mortality is still today one of the most relevant social and health scourges in developing countries. This is the reason why high levels of maternal mortality are always interpreted as a sign of low living standards, ignorance, poverty and woman discrimination. Maternal mortality represents, therefore, a very peculiar characteristic of demographic systems of ancien regime. Despite this important role in demographic systems, no systematic study has been addressed to investigate the impact of maternal mortality in historical Italy. The aim of this article is to shed some light on such a phenomenon by investigating its trend over time and the determinants in some Italian populations between the 18th and the early 20th centuries. The analysis will make use of civil and parish registers linked together by means of nominative techniques, and it will be, therefore, carried out at the micro level. 
 
PREDICTION: 
This article aims to provide a first systematic analysis of maternal mortality in 19th- and early 20th-century Italy. This will be done not only by analysing national statistics from 1862 onwards but also by investigating a sample of Italian communities from North to South using reconstructed individual data. This approach not only enables us to outline a picture of the levels of maternal mortality across 19th- and early 20th-century Italy but also allows a more in-depth analysis of the determinants of maternal mortality in the country. 
 
FULL TEXT: 
 Keywords: maternal mortality; pretransitional; Italy; individual dataLow living standards, illiteracy, poverty, discrimination against women and high maternalmortality are all well-represented in the demographic systems of pretransitional popula-tions in Europe.1 These are systems that were characterised, demographically speaking,by high levels of fertility and mortality, respectively, due to the absence of birth controland frequent epidemics. In these populations, pregnancy proved a risky event: therewere recurrent waves of puerperal sepsis; infections contracted during childbirth; un-skilled midwives; repeated deliveries and general hard work even immediately before andafter birth. However, maternal mortality varied across 19th-century European countriesMatteo Manfredini is an Associate Professor of Demography at the University of Parma.

Not only was itpolitically fragmented, and one of the less developed areas, at least up to 1861, but it wasalso one that comprised of populations with the slowest process of demographic transition,something that makes Italy quite different from the other European countries for which ma-ternal mortality indicators have been calculated. Given this, one would expect levels of ma-ternal mortality in Italy to be amongst the highest in Europe. However, only a few localstudies on small Italian communities have been carried out,2 which limits not only the possi-bility of situating Italian maternal mortality in the larger European context but also robs us ofa comprehensive sense of female health conditions in pre-industrial Italy. This article aims,first of all, to fill that gap by providing a first systematic analysis of maternal mortality in19th- and early 20th-century Italy. This will be done not only by analysing national statisticsfrom 1862 onwards but also by investigating a sample of Italian communities from North toSouth using reconstructed individual data. This approach not only enables us to outline a pic-ture of the levels of maternal mortality across 19th- and early 20th-century Italy. It alsoallows a more in-depth analysis of the determinants of maternal mortality in the country.The article is divided into five sections. The section ‘The Aetiological Mechanisms ofMaternal Mortality in Pretransitional Populations’ describes possible aetiological mechanismsof maternal mortality in 19th- and early 20th-century Europe. The section ‘MaternalMortality in Europe: A Brief Outline’ illustrates the patterns of maternal mortality in some se-lected European countries based on some of the socio-economic, demographic and healthfactors associated with maternal mortality. Using the same indicators, the section ‘TheItalian Context’ discusses the position of Italy within the European context in the 19th andearly 20th centuries. The section ‘The Italian Population Sample: Description and Analysis’provides an outline of the local populations studied, the potentialities and limitations of thesources used, and, finally, a discussion of maternal mortality from such a sample of Italian lo-cal populations.The Aetiological Mechanisms of Maternal Mortalityin Pretransitional PopulationsFrom a theoretical point of view, the risk factors for maternal mortality can be dividedinto two main groups, direct and indirect factors.3 Direct causes of maternal morbidityand mortality result from complications in pregnancy and childbirth. They include hae-morrhage, infection, high blood pressure, unsafe abortion and obstructed labour. Themost common cause of death in the 19th century was puerperal sepsis, a general andsystemic infection during or after childbirth, the aetiologic agents of which were usuallystreptococci or staphylococci. These developed on the uterus and the placenta, and theinfection either remained there or spread beyond it, passing into the bloodstream2A. M.

Asdemonstrated in those developing countries in which data on causes of death are avail-able, direct causes of maternal death, in particular sepsis, are usually associated withhow young someone is at childbirth and low parity, especially primiparity.4Indirect causes of maternal mortality include all the deaths due to pre-existing condi-tions aggravated by pregnancy or diseases developed during pregnancy, but not directlyconnected to obstetric complications, such as pneumonia, malaria and other illnesses. Inpre-industrial societies, according to Perrenoud and Imhof, the part of maternal mortalitynot directly connected with childbirth was also associated with a ‘progressive deteriora-tion of a mother’s health in the course of her reproductive life’.5 What we term now asmaternal depletion syndrome6 is a process in which repeated reproductive cycles, theneed to work during and immediately after pregnancy and poor nutrition could leadmothers to physical and psychological exhaustion.7 These factors could break the delicateequilibrium between nutrient intake and energy expenditure, leading to weight loss andnutrient drainage. This could, in turn, make women more susceptible to anaemia, infec-tions and fatigue, thereby reducing their chances of survival. Maternal depletion is, assuch, a syndrome produced by the interaction of many social and physiological factors,whose disentanglement results, however, quite difficult in a historical context. Poor nutri-tion is now regarded as the key element of this condition,8 but there are also biodemo-graphic factors that can be associated with maternal depletion syndrome. These includehigh parity, short birth intervals and late age at childbirth.9 The combination of these4B.

A correct approachshould, therefore, include proxies of the socio-economic background of mothers as con-text variables in the analysis of the determinants of maternal mortality.The evidence that maternal mortality has varied a great deal in past times is just theconsequence of the different combination of the above-mentioned factors in variouscontexts. There is, of course, also, the role that the quality of sources, the accuracy anddetail of available data and of the criteria adopted to define maternal mortality mightplay in our perceptions of these realities.Maternal Mortality in Europe: A Brief OutlineAs will be evident from the theoretical framework described earlier, maternal mortality isexpected to be lower in the most developed countries and in those ahead in the processof demographic transition. The two features are obviously interrelated, affecting thedrop of maternal mortality in two different ways. First, mothers living in more developedcountries experience intrinsically lower mortality due to medical progress and the diffu-sion of state medical support, better hygiene and improvements in nutrition; secondly,fewer children per woman, as is typical of transitional countries, reduced the risk of ma-ternal death.Sweden and England are useful examples here. In these countries, maternal mortalityin mid-18th century was around 12–13 per thousand, just when crude mortality rateshad begun to decline, more slowly in England (12 per cent between 1750 and 1850),and more quickly in Sweden (25 per cent in the same period). As for fertility, in bothcountries, it started to decline sharply and continuously, after some fluctuations, only inthe late 19th century.10 In parallel with overall mortality, maternal mortality dropped by30–40 per cent in the second half of the 18th century and continued to decline in the19th century: it fell eventually to around 5 mothers’ deaths per thousand births.11France was the European country where the process of demographic transition startedearliest. Mortality rates, in fact, declined there by a remarkable 34 per cent between1750 and 1850, while fertility had dropped steeply since the mid-18th century.12 Thus,in the second half of the 18th century, maternal mortality had already begun its10For a reconstruction of mortality rates series forEuropean countries, see A.

In the mid-19th century, Germany had high levels of ma-ternal mortality, close to 12 per thousand, while Slavonia (a region in present-dayCroatia) showed an increasing trend until after the 1860s, with peaks over 16 per thou-sand. Interestingly, such a rise in maternal mortality was attributed to the withdrawal ofmale labour from peasant families due to military mobilisation, which made households(and their members) more fragile and vulnerable.15Along with progress in medicine and the introduction of vaccines,16 various authors at-tribute a key role in the decline in maternal mortality to the introduction of home-basedmidwifery assistance and, especially during the 19th century and the spread of industriali-sation, to public health policies such as the legal protection of women and workingmothers.17 Professional regulations of trained midwives were, in fact, introduced inSweden in the late 17th century, a period in which midwifery schools started to be activein England, although the formal regulation of professional midwifery began only in1902.18 Trained midwives had been active since the 18th century in France, where, how-ever, a law protecting motherhood was enacted only in 1874 (the Roussel bill); stricterlegislation limiting the number of hours worked by women came only in the very early1900s.19 This occurred later than in other European countries, such as Britain, where gov-ernments had concerned themselves with the protection of children and women workingin the mines and mills since 1802 and the first Mines and Factory Acts.20Beyond national maternal mortality figures, local variability proved the norm, withmarked differences especially between cities and the countryside. For example, mid-19th-century London had higher maternal mortality levels compared to England as awhole, while in 19th-century Belgium, maternal mortality could vary from a modest 5 perthousand in Limburg to 11.8 in Sart, a pattern similar to that found in the same period inFrance, where scholars have documented figures from 10 per thousand in the city ofRouen to 17 per thousand in the village of Mogneneins, to higher rates (around 50 perthousand) in the maternal hospitals of Marseille and Port Royal.2113H.

Before looking inmore detail at the levels and determinants of maternal mortality in Italy based on ourpopulation samples, it is, therefore, fundamental, using the same indicators, to providesome background to the demographic, socio-economic and political elements of thecountry. This will help us not only in assessing its position within Europe but also in con-textualising the results on maternal mortality shown further.22 From a demographic pointof view, Italy experienced a late demographic transition. In the period 1750–1850, it didnot show, unlike the countries described earlier, any substantial decline in mortality, withthe overall mortality rate fluctuating around 31–32 deaths per thousand people per yearand with very high levels of infant mortality at the beginning of the 20th century (166 in-fant deaths per thousand births in 1901).23 Mortality, in fact, started to decline only after1880, followed 10 years later by a widespread drop in fertility.24As for the socio-economic situation, Italy was a latecomer to the industrial revolution.This backwardness is reflected in the share of male subjects working in the agriculturalsector: over 70 per cent in 1861 (and still over 60 per cent in 1901), substantially morethan most other Western European countries, such as England (19.3 per cent in 1871).25In this poor economic context, women had low labour force participation rates, around50 per cent in 1881, dropping to a little over 40 per cent in 1901.26 Illiteracy is probablythe best indicator of Italy’s slow development with respect to the most industrialisedEuropean countries of the period. Illiteracy in Italy stood, in fact, at 67.2 per cent in 1881,and was still common, especially among female subjects, around 1900, when it stood at56.0 per cent, against figures below 5 per cent for Sweden, England and France.27accouchement à haut risque.

National figures up to1861 represent, therefore, only a partial picture ofthe deep regional variability in Italy in those years.23Actually, the mortality figures for the period 1750–1850 refer to North Italy.

With the absence of the state, home birth was the norm. This was not only becausethe few maternity hospitals tended to be devoted to the care of unmarried mothers andtheir offspring but also because distrust of science and medical doctors discouraged preg-nant women from having births in institutions. Indeed, private and public maternity hospi-tals, who had provided assistance and care for infants and newly mothers since the end ofthe 18th century, catered, especially in cities, only to a minority of mothers. Women usuallygave birth at home with the assistance of non-professional midwives, despite the fact thatmany midwifery schools had been open in Italy since the 17th century. This was especiallytrue in the countryside, where rural families did not welcome outside midwives even if theywere better trained. This suspicion of modern birthing methods was so deep-rooted inItalian society that in 1953, home births still accounted for 80 per cent of all births.29What emerges from the few descriptive notes provided earlier is that the health ofItalian women was not sufficiently guaranteed when they gave birth, especially whencompared with the most developed European countries. Lack of hospital facilities fornew mothers, limited use of trained midwives, general ignorance and poor socio-economic conditions were, in fact, common in Italy in the 19th and early 20th centuries.The Italian Population Sample: Description and AnalysisAs described earlier, 19th-century Italy was characterised by the absence of laws on ma-ternal protection for the whole peninsula before 1861, by strong asymmetries in demo-graphic and family systems across the territory with regional differences in socio-economic conditions and by an unequal distribution of hospital facilities for mothers andparturients. As a result, researchers interested in the history of maternal mortality in Italyneed to collect data from local populations situated in different parts of the country. Andthis is exactly what we have done by selecting seven Italian populations between the19th and 20th centuries. Such populations differ in many respects, representing differentregions and socio-economic contexts. Madregolo and the parishes of the Upper ParmaValley (Corniglio, Palanzano and Monchio delle Corti) are located in northern Italy, inwhat once was the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Madregolo is located on the plainclose to the Taro river, while the three parishes of the upper Parma valley are on themountains, 50–60 km south of Parma. Casalguidi and Civitella del Tronto are in centralItaly in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and in the Bourbon Kingdom of Naples, respectively.28D. I. Kertzer and R. P.

In 1861, the year of the Italian unification, all these commu-nities became part of the Kingdom of Italy.Table 1 shows some demographic indicators of the selected populations, namely themean population size, infant mortality rate and total marital fertility rate. Beyond the intrinsiclocal variability, these indicators depict undoubtedly a pretransitional (or early transitional)context, with high mortality and high fertility levels. On the other hand, from an economicpoint of view, the populations analysed were largely rural in the periods under consideration,except for Civitella del Tronto and Alghero, whose socio-economic structure was more com-plex. In particular, Civitella was characterised by a relatively high number of resident soldiers,while in Alghero, sheep farming and sea-related activities were not uncommon.30 In addi-tion, Alghero, as a ‘city’, was also the only population, in our sample, to have a hospital forthe assistance of parturients in the period.31 In the villages of Madregolo and Casalguidi,sharecropping was the common system of land tenure, although there were also poor daylabourers. The presence of sharecroppers was associated with the establishment of largeand complex households, which made the social structure in Madregolo and Casalguidiquite different from that of all the other populations studied here.32 This agricultural systemdominated by landless peasants contrasts with the one existing in Civitella and the upperParma valley,33 where most farmers were smallholders involved in sheep farming activities.To investigate maternal mortality in the sample populations, we used a data set includ-ing all the births in these communities where a mother’s life status after childbirth isknown. The sources we used to construct this collection of births differ because of theTable 1.

For the Val Parma, Madregolo and Casalguidi, datacame from the parish registers of baptism, marriage and burial, whose individual infor-mation have been associated by means of family reconstitution methods, based on nomi-native linkage. This technique has two major goals. First, it allowed us to reconstruct thelife history of each person, as well as the offspring of each mother. Secondly, thanks tothe linkage procedure we were able to recover some information that was not directlyrecorded in the religious registers. The mother’s age at birth was, in fact, never recorded,while age at death only sometimes. Both had, therefore, to be estimated by linking indi-vidual information from different acts. For the parish of Madregolo and Casalguidi, a fur-ther religious register has been employed for family reconstitution, namely the ‘StatusAnimarum’. This was a sort of census drawn up by the priest each Easter, in which herecorded each family in the village along with individual information such as name, sur-name, age, marital status and each household member’s relationship to the householdhead.34 The same methodology has been applied to the information available in the civilrecords of the municipalities of Civitella del Tronto and Alghero. Civil records are con-cerned with important events in a person’s life taken by the local authority: these includebirth, marriage and death certificates.35 The advantage of civil records is that they reportprecise dates. Birth certificates, for instance, record the precise date of birth, informationnot always recorded in the religious registers of birth, which may report, instead, thedate of baptism. It is well known that baptism could sometimes take place days afterbirth. The determination of maternal mortality and the calculation of the distance be-tween a child’s birth and mother’s death might, then, prove inaccurate for populationswhose reconstruction is based on parish registers.36Due to differences in the nature, accuracy and completeness of the sources, the infor-mation collected differs across populations. A mother’s age is usually available, but in ValParma, the mother’s age at birth is missing for about 20 per cent of the birth records.37Parity is obviously undetermined for all those couples whose marriages were notrecorded locally, with particularly high levels in Madregolo (about 48 per cent) due to thehigh mobility of the population.A measure of the general level of mortality (crude death rate) is available year after yearwith the exception of only a few years in Madregolo and Val Parma. Household composi-tion data are obviously present where census-like sources are available, that is, inMadregolo and Casalguidi, while non-demographic information, such as grain prices, varies34Parish registers are often the only source to studypre-unitary Italian populations. However, the infor-mation was recorded for a religious purpose, so thatsometimes they present some gaps and inaccuracies.For instance, birth acts may report the date of bap-tism instead of the date of birth, death acts never re-port the cause of death and only rarely the age atdeath, whilst marriage acts only record the marriagescelebrated in the parish. Marriages of parishionerscelebrated elsewhere are not mentioned. For moreinsight into the structure and content of Italian parishregisters and on linkage procedures, see M.Manfredini, ‘L’utilizzo degli Status Animarum nellericostruzioni nominative: miglioramenti informativiqualitativi e quantitativi. Il caso di Madregolo (1629-1914)’, Bollettino di Demografia Storica, 1996, 24/25, 113–29.35For the population of Alghero, civil records havebeen integrated with information taken from parishregisters (baptisms, burials and marriages).36For example, six mothers in the Val Parma populationdied some days before the child’s birth, which is anobvious result of using baptism dates instead of thedate of birth.37We can have information on mother’s age at birthvia direct records (especially for civil records) orthrough calculations based on the nominative link-age of parish acts.Maternal Mortality in Italy 9Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/shm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/shm/hkz001/5307423 by UNI UDINE user on 07 February 2019from place to place. Prices data are always available for Casalguidi and always missing forCivitella del Tronto; for Madregolo and Val Parma, they are missing for the 18th century,while for Alghero, no price information is available between 1923 and 1935.Due to a general absence of information on causes of deaths, each study investigatingmaternal mortality in pretransitional Italy, ours included, must be based on an indirectdefinition of maternal mortality, which considers maternal deaths to be those that tookplace within 60 days of childbirth. Gatti provided a detailed study of the Sardinian parishof Ales, determining a level of maternal mortality of 10.9 deaths per thousand live birthsin the period 1695–1825.38 She found evidence that the central part of the 18th centurypresented the highest values, between 11 and 16 per thousand, while the mean valuefor the first 25 years of the 19th century was 9.2 per thousand. Silini conducted a similarstudy for the population of Lovere (Lombardy) for 1816–65, estimating a lower level ofmaternal mortality, around 8 deaths per thousand live births. This, although, was calcu-lated for a shorter period after delivery, namely the first 30 days after childbirth.39 Thesevalues are relatively high according to what was reported in the first section, but they arefar from being representative of Italian society.A more exhaustive and indicative analysis of the levels of maternal mortality in Italy canbe carried out using official data on causes of deaths.40 In Italy, this information startedto be recorded in 1881, although it was limited to the death certificates in chief towns.It is only in 1887 that this practice was extended to the whole of Italy, making it possibleto assess the levels of mortality due to the report ‘Malattie della gravidanza, parto e puer-perio’ [illnesses related to the pregnancy, delivery and post-partum period]. Figure 1shows the evolution of the maternal mortality rates in Italy between 1887 and 1955.The first clear discontinuity occurred around 1890, when the rate dropped markedlyfrom values of 6.0–5.3 to 4.1 maternal deaths per thousand live births. This is likely con-nected with the increasing use of antiseptics in Italian hospitals.41 After that decline, therate remained steady around 2.5–3.0 per thousand until 1937, when it started to drop tolevels just above 1 per thousand. This decline in maternal mortality, especially from 1937onwards, is closely associated with the decline of the per cent of maternal deaths due tosepticaemia, due to the introduction of sulfonamides in the treatment of puerperal sep-sis. In 1887, about 70 per cent of maternal deaths were due to this blood infection, aproportion that fell lower in 1955, when only 12.8 per cent of maternal deaths were aconsequence of septicaemia.However, the impact of maternal mortality differed in the various Italian regions.Generally speaking, southern Italy had higher values than central and northern regions,42with Sardinia having, at the end of the 19th century, the highest level of maternal mortal-ity (5.3 deaths per thousand births in 1889–92).43 Beyond reasons of economic nature,38Gatti, ‘Nascita dell’ostetricia’, 85.39Silini, ‘Metodologia e risultati preliminari’, 342.40Data extracted and elaborated from Central Instituteof Statistics, Annuario di Statistiche Demografiche(Rome: A.BE.T.E., 1955).41A.

However, they came mainly fromthe mainland and were not welcomed by localfamilies.10 Matteo Manfredini et al.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/shm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/shm/hkz001/5307423 by UNI UDINE user on 07 February 2019this situation was also the consequence of a smaller network of hospitals, a lack of skilledassistance to parturients and the stronger influence of the Church in the local approachto maternity and maternal care.44Unfortunately, these statistics cover only Italy after unification, saying nothing about thesituation before 1887. The selection of the population studied in this article offers viceversa the opportunity to study maternal mortality also for the pre-1861 period. The num-bers and rates of maternal deaths in the populations studied are displayed in Table 2.Apart from the data concerning the 18th-century Parma Valley, which are so low as tocast doubt on their accuracy (5 deaths per thousand live births) especially in comparisonwith the figures elsewhere, the lowest levels of maternal mortality in the 19th centurywere from Civitella del Tronto (4.2 per thousand). Casalguidi and Alghero, on the otherhand, show higher values (6.7 and 6.8 per thousand, respectively), but not as high asthose estimated for the Parma Valley (8.4 per thousand). The first 35 years of the 20thcentury saw, in Civitella and Alghero, a marked drop in the maternal mortality rate,which fell to about 4 deaths per thousand live births in both populations. Overall, thedata indicate levels of maternal mortality about 6.7 per thousand in the 19th century and4.0 per thousand in the first 35 years of the 20th century. These figures are consistentwith the national levels that are shown in Figure 3. Moreover, the value of the maternalmortality rate for the city of Alghero appears consistent with that found by Gatti, oncethe different period and the expected differential between the city and the countrysideare taken into account.

There are quali-tative and quantitative elements supporting both hypotheses. For example, in a bookpublished in 1832 in Parma, Lorenzo Molossi reported that in the maternity hospital ofParma, only 3 maternal deaths of 1,011 childbirths were recorded in the years 1821–30.This would seem to support the hypothesis of low maternal mortality levels in the townof Parma at the beginning of the 19th century.45 On the other hand, no maternal deathswere found during the Napoleonic campaigns of the beginning of the 19th century(1800–15) either in the Parma province or in Civitella. This might suggest that the regis-tration of deaths and/or births suffered in this turbulent period of Italian history.Generally speaking, when maternal mortality is estimated indirectly from the number oflive births, as it is in this study, some issues may negatively affect the estimate. First of all,there is the issue of stillborn babies. These were, in fact, usually excluded from the parishbirth registers: this was true even in the case of an emergency baptism, that is, a baptismadministered by the midwife to a newborn in danger of death. However, diagnosticproblems in differentiating between stillborn deaths and early neonatal deaths make itdifficult to have reliable estimates even when based on civil records.46 Such an under-registration of stillborn births is then likely to lead to an underestimate in maternal mor-tality due to the strong relationship between stillbirths and a mother’s death and the im-possibility of relating these deaths to childbearing. Secondly, a large proportion ofmothers dying from maternal causes actually died before they were able to give birth.The combination of the two effects could, therefore, affect the maternal mortality esti-mate more heavily. After the study of detailed data on mothers’ deaths from Sweden,Roger Schofield proposed introducing a correction.47 According to him, ‘the total ratecould be predicted fairly accurately from the live-born maternal rate by increasing the lat-ter by 7 per cent and adding a further constant of 2.73 per thousand’.48 Once applied tothe figures shown in Table 3, this correction gives us adjusted estimates of maternal mor-tality in the populations studied, which places them, according to the values outlined inthe first section, on the same level as France.Table 2.

We have already noted how this measure can be affected byhaving the date of baptism rather than the birth date. Some mothers, in fact, appear tohave died some days before the birth of their child. Despite this inconsistency, a mother’sdeath becomes, as expected, less likely as time passes from childbirth. About 13 per centof maternal deaths occurred on the day of childbirth and 50 per cent within 10 days ofchildbirth. About 85 per cent of mothers’ deaths occurred in the first month after deliv-ery, and only 25 (7.9 per cent) women died between 42 and 60 days from childbirth.As noted earlier, the sample consists of married women aged 15–49 years whose life sta-tus after childbirth is known. Because of likely under-registration bias prior to 1817 in someof the communities studied, the period investigated in the analysis of the determinants ofmaternal mortality spans 1818–1935. Illegitimate births of women, who subsequently mar-ried have been excluded because they obviously did not predict maternal death.To analyse individual maternal mortality data, a Gompertz duration model is usuallyand profitably adopted as its steadily decreasing functional form nicely fits the decliningtrend of the risk of maternal death after childbirth. The aim of such a regression is tomeasure the effects of a set of variables on the hazard of maternal death.49We estimated two models, a basic model aimed at capturing the effects of biodemo-graphic factors on maternal mortality (Table 4)50 and a second, more complex model, in-cluding variables concerning exogenous factors of demographic and of a socio-economicnature.51 This second model is specifically aimed at highlighting the possible effects ofcontext variables, which could play a relevant role in the rural and familistic societies ofItaly, namely grain prices and household structure. The basic model estimates the effectson maternal mortality of six different variables. Community is a covariate whose aim istwofold. On one hand, it should stress the intrinsic differences among the communitiesstudied, in particular those concerning the epidemiological characteristics of each setting;on the other hand, it should control for differentials over time due to the different timeintervals analysed in the various populations. Plenty of studies have highlighted the roleTable 3.

Values higher than one meanodds increase, whilst values lower than one meanodds decrease. In particular, when the variable iscontinuous (i.e. CDR), HR indicates the change in thehazard ‘per’ one unit increase in the variable, andwhen the variable is categorical (i.e. Multiple Births),it indicates the change in the hazard with respect toa reference category.

Older women are more likely to develop complicationsassociated with haemorrhage and toxaemia, while the youngest are believed to be moreexposed due to inexperience, physiological immaturity and competing nutritional needsbetween them and their offspring.52 However, some recent findings on contemporarydata have cast some doubts on the higher mortality of young mothers, hypothesising aJ-shaped association.53 This is the reason why a categorical variable has been used. Anonlinear effect on mother’s death has also been proved for parity.54 Primiparous andhigh-fertility women are, in fact, expected to share the highest risks of death. The primip-arous would suffer most from obstructed labour, while high-fertility women would beclearly more exposed to maternal depletion. As for the length of the birth interval,55shorter intervals might be more burdensome for mothers, both for physiological and so-cial reasons.56 Close births are more likely associated not only with the premature rupture010203040Frequency0 5 10 1 5 2 0 2 5 30 35 40 45 50 55 60Days since childbi rthFig. 2 Number of maternal deaths within 60 days after childbirth for all populations.52D.

A series of biological complications during and afterchildbirth have been documented to affect the survival of mothers experiencing bothTable 4.

However, because of the problematic definition ofstillbirth not only in parish registers but, to some extent, also in civil records, the death ofthe child within 5 days of birth was considered as such.61The results not only show some expected outcomes but also some peculiarities. As forpopulations, Civitella presents the lowest hazard ratio of maternal mortality, whilst theParma province has the highest. The outcome reflects especially the different periodsstudied, earlier for Parma and Casalguidi, more recent for Civitella and Alghero. As manystudies have shown, adult mortality began to decline in Italy only in the last two decadesof the 19th century.62 But the first two decades of the 20th century were still very diffi-cult years because of the First World War and the pandemic flu. Then, it was only after1918 that overall mortality and maternal mortality declined more markedly. This findingprovides (partial) confirmation of what emerged from the official statistics of maternalmortality shown in Figure 2.As for mother’s age at birth, the effects on the hazard of maternal death are modestand no U-shaped effect has been found. The coefficient associated with the youngestmothers resulted, in fact, to not be statistically significant. The only association is, there-fore, limited to the old age component. Older mothers were positively and significantlyassociated with maternal mortality, being 75 per cent more likely to die after childbirthwhen compared with mothers aged 23–39 years. High-parity women (more than fourchildren) were significantly 31 per cent more likely to die than mothers of two to threeparity, whilst primiparous mothers showed no significant effect. As for birth interval, wefound a J-shaped association between interval length and the hazard ratio of mother’sdeath. Short (<1.5 years) and especially long birth (4þ years) intervals showed higherhazard ratios of maternal mortality when compared with birth intervals between 1.5 and4 years (þ35 per cent and þ86 per cent, respectively). However, if primiparous mothersare excluded from the sample, thereby limiting the analysis to strict interbirth intervals,the hazard ratio curve becomes much more U-shaped (þ45 per cent and þ66 per cent,respectively), with both shorter and longer intervals being statistically significant atp< 0.05. In the light of the theory of maternal depletion syndrome, older age, high parityand close birth intervals should represent risk factors for that specific syndrome. As forthe effect of longer birth intervals on maternal mortality, this could be a sign, as antici-pated, either of the presence of non-recorded miscarriages or of subfecundity due to60A.

An International Studyof Maternal Care and Maternal Mortality 1800–1950(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992).61Actually, the death of a child within 5 days from birthcan either be a cause of a mother’s death or a conse-quence of this event, denoting the existence of a re-verse causation effect between those two factors.The problem is, however, not easily resolved be-cause, as already mentioned, religious sources do notallow for any differentiation between ‘real’ stillbirthsand children who died just a few days after birth.One should, therefore, be very wary in the interpre-tation of the direction of causality.

Finally, as expected, multiple births and the death of the baby within 5days of birth were the most important determinants of maternal mortality. Mothers withmultiple births were three times more likely to die than uniparous mothers were, whilethe death of the child in the very first days after delivery was associated with a six timesincrease in the hazard ratio of mother’s death.In the second model (Table 5), the effect of grain price (logged) is analysed along withthe level of background mortality, measured by means of the crude death rate (CDR):namely the ratio between total deaths and population size in a given year. It is commonin historical demography to use grain prices as a proxy for food consumption. Increasesin prices could worsen food availability, and consequently nutritional status and health ofnewly mothers, concurring to exacerbate maternal depletion.63 However, maternal mor-tality is also associated with community background mortality,64 whose levels did not ob-viously depend only on price fluctuations. The introduction of CDR aims exactly atcontrolling all that part of background mortality not directly associated with grain pricefluctuations. As for our populations, we collected wheat price series from the market ofParma (used for the province of Parma), the market of Florence (used for Casalguidi) andthe market of Sassari (for Alghero).65 No price data were available for Civitella. CDR andgrain price trends for the period 1818–1922 are shown in Figure 3 for the populationsfor which they are available.There is a close association between CDR and grain prices fluctuations and importantsocio-economic, demographic and temporal differences among populations. Given this,the analysis of the effects of grain price and CDR on maternal mortality has been investi-gated by means of an interaction, once controlled for all the other covariates described inTable 4. In particular, two interaction terms were added, each of them concerning one ofthe context variables (grain price and CDR) and a dummy variable for populations, con-trasting Alghero with the other communities studied.66 The analysis has been limited topopulations and to years for which both CDR and grain prices were available, namely1818–1922.None of the context variables, neither CDR nor prices, returned a significant effect onmaternal mortality in any of the communities studied. One possible partial explanation isthat food availability may have been unaffected by price fluctuations on account of the63Scalone, ‘Effects of Nutritional Stress’.64Actually, background adult mortality was bettersuited than overall mortality to represent maternalmortality. However, the assessment of the local levelsof adult mortality based on family reconstitutionmethods is difficult and often subject to stochasticfluctuations when estimated for small populations.Annual population sizes were then determined fromthe Status Animarum for Casalguidi and Madregolo,from post-unitary annual demographic statistics forthe municipalities of Alghero and Civitella del Tronto,while for the pre-unity years for Civitella, they havebeen estimated by means of Inverse Projection tech-niques based on civil statistics and some Bourboncensuses.65Time series of prices come from different sources.For Parma, see P.

For Florence, see P.Bandettini, ‘I prezzi sul mercato di Firenze dal 1800 al1890’, Archivio economico dell’unificazione italiana,5th series, 1 (Turin: ILTE, 1957). For Sassari, the priceseries was reconstructed using raw data from theMarket Price Registers kept within the local historicalArchive.66Prices have been included in the model afterdetrending of time series by means of the Hodrick–Prescott filter, which is widely used in macroeco-nomic studies to extract cyclical movements abouttrends in time series.Maternal Mortality in Italy 17Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/shm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/shm/hkz001/5307423 by UNI UDINE user on 07 February 2019rural nature of the communities studied (Alghero included). This might have guaranteedfamilies and individuals with enough food through the year even in difficult times.The last analysis we carried out is for household structure. In the theory of maternal de-pletion, the necessity to resume farm work, house work and child care just after child-birth could worsen the health conditions of mothers leading to physical and mentalexhaustion.67 In societies lacking social institutions aimed at the assistance and care ofmothers, individuals could often count only on the help of kin.68 This is especially true forItaly at the turn of the 20th century, where the dependence on home births made thehousehold the primary setting for maternal health care. Usually, the technique of familyreconstitution based on religious or civil records does not allow for such effects becauseit does not provide any clue for the co-residential pattern. This latter information is, how-ever, fundamental for understanding the possible redistribution within the family groupFig. 3 CDR and price trends in the populations studied, 1818–1923.67Oris, Neven and Alter, ‘Maternal Depletion’, 162–68;E.

In this study, the availability of continuouscensus data for Casalguidi and Madregolo has allowed a precise and detailed assessmentof the household structure year after year. A categorical variable indicating the structureof the household (nuclear, extended, multiple, undefined) in which the mother lived atthe moment of delivery has, therefore, been added to the basic model. Although basedon a limited sample (about 5,300 births and 35 maternal deaths), the results show(Table 6) that living in a nuclear household increases the hazard of maternal mortality byabout 52 per cent, when compared with living in a complex household (statistically signif-icant at the 10 per cent level). The hazard for those living in extended households is con-versely not statistically significant, although the coefficient is in line with that of multiplehouseholds. The results prove that, in sharecropping societies, large and complex house-holds may provide mothers with more effective assistance than simpler family groupscould do, thereby lowering their risk of maternal death. Usually, many female membersof complex households (daughters, sisters or other female kin) might, in fact, help newlymothers by taking over their family duties. In this way, they give them time to recoverfrom the stress of childbirth.69 This was clearly less likely in nuclear family contexts, wherethe mother was often the only female adult in the household and was forced to takecare of children and run the household almost immediately after childbirth.As nuclear households were usually poorer than multiple ones, a further model con-cerning only Casalguidi was run to disentangle household well-being effects from thoseassociated with household structure. The results (not shown here for the sake of brevity)demonstrate that the pattern holds even when the economic situation of the family iscontrolled for. This implies that the effect of household structure on maternal mortality isstrictly associated with the composition of the household rather than household’s eco-nomic resources.Discussion and Conclusive RemarksThis study provides the first organic effort to analyse maternal mortality in pretransitionaland early transitional Italy, a topic that Italian historical demographers have never tackledsystematically. Based on individual data from different populations across Italy, the analy-ses have not only provided further confirmation of well-known theories, but they havealso raised new queries and interpretations.Estimates of the levels of maternal mortality, once corrected for missing stillbirths, putour Italian communities on the same level as other European countries, even those in amore advanced stage of demographic transition such as France.As for the determinants of maternal mortality, the results provide contrasting findings.On one hand, the significant and positive effects of old age, close birth intervals and highparity on maternal mortality appear to be indirect evidence of the role of maternal deple-tion. On the other hand, the statistically insignificant role of grain prices would seem to69For a description of the roles and relationshipsamong the members of sharecropping households,see A. Doveri, ‘Land, Fertility, and Family: A SelectedReview of the Literature in Historical Demography’,Genus, 2000, LVI, 19–59; G.

Breschi, ‘Living Arrangements and theElderly: An Analysis of Old-Age Mortality byHousehold Structure in Casalguidi, 1819–1859’,Demography, 2013, 50, 1593–613.Maternal Mortality in Italy 19Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/shm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/shm/hkz001/5307423 by UNI UDINE user on 07 February 2019suggest that economic stresses had little effect on food availability in rural communitiesand, consequently, on the survival of women who had just given birth. If malnutrition iskey for the maternal depletion syndrome, then our results do not suggest that this dis-ease was particularly widespread. More realistically, what these results seem to suggest isthat, although not clinically verifiable, some sort of maternal depletion was definitelycommon among new mothers living in the rural communities studied here. Italians moth-ers were burdened by many and frequent childbirths, often giving birth at home withoutskilled assistance and frequently required to get back to their work duties soon after de-livery to supplement a meagre family income. As such, these women obviously sufferednot only from risk factors directly associated with delivery but also, and especially, fromthe consequences associated with the physical exhaustion deriving from the combinationof these factors. More than simple food availability, therefore, what mattered most wasthe extreme difficulty in recovering from the physical consequences of childbearing anddelivery.The evidence of the protective role played by complex household structures on moth-ers’ survival further supports this line of reasoning. Das Gupta found evidence that in thepatrilineal joint family system of Northern India, the strong gender division and thelower social role of women yield a higher risk of maternal death because a mother ‘mayhesitate to mention [any health problem occurring after childbirth] and even when shementions it the matter will be considered by those senior to her before action is taken’.70Table 5.

Despite the lack of hospitalisation, unskilled as-sistance during delivery and repeated childbirths, the multiple household guaranteedmothers help. They could be replaced in many everyday activities both during and afterchildbirth, thereby releasing them from some domestic duties and hard work in the fields.This would reduce physical exhaustion and allow mothers to recover more quickly fromchildbirth. This appears to have represented a decisive step forward in decreasing thehazard ratio of maternal mortality. In such cases, we can see the family network actingas and effectively replacing an absent welfare state.Although based on two small sharecropping populations, this finding is sufficient, inour opinion, to encourage further studies looking at the importance of household struc-ture for maternal mortality. There is a strong suspicion that only the complete reconstruc-tion of the co-residential pattern of mothers can help us evaluate possible complexmechanisms of mutual help and care among household members, especially among fe-male subjects.Maternal Mortality in Italy 21Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/shm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/shm/hkz001/5307423 by UNI UDINE user on 07 February 2019
