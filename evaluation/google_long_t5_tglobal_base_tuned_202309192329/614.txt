ABSTRACT: 
© 2016 Taylor & Francis. When President Gerald Ford decided tomaintain and deepen arms relations with Iran, he cemented a momentum that became near impossible for a successor to break by continuing the policy of his predecessor Richard Nixon. Nixon had given the Shah of Iran a "blank cheque" to purchase whatever American arms he desired- short of nuclear weapons. Although Ford’s authority would be challenged by members of his own Administration and a Congress seeking to claw back some of its authority, the need to support allies in the Middle East against the threat of the Soviet Union, even during a time of détente, remained paramount. 
 
PREDICTION: 
This article examines the U.S.-Iran arms sales to Iran during the period from 1972 to 1979. It argues that the President's policy on Iran was consistent with his administration's policy on Iran. It argues that the relationship between the United States and Iran was based on mutual understanding, and that the President's policy on Iran was based on his personal knowledge of the situation in Iran. As such, continuing major arms sales to Iran seemed perfectly logical to the Administration, despite the misgivings of a small minority. The policy continued under Carter until the revolution of 1979 ended any influence America might have in Iran.
