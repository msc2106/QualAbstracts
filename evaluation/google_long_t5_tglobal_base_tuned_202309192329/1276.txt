Thus, as the risingcosts of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (–) put pressure onBritain’s financial systems, the burdens placed on the Bank increased. Aside fromthe additional financial support it offered to the state, the stresses on the Bank man-ifested most clearly in increases in its workload. In its position as primary manager ofthe public debt, it had to cope with rising numbers of public creditors demandingprompt attention when they wished to sell or purchase government stocks orcollect their interest payments and dividends. Throughout the war period, theBank had also to manage a vastly increased discounting business. As Claphamnotes, the average amount of bills of exchange discounted had only been a littleover £. million in  but by  it was over £ million per annum(Clapham , II, p. ).

The suspension resultedin a significantly increased note issue and extended that issue, for the first time, to smalldenomination notes (Clapham , II, p. ; Newby ). One of the unintendedconsequences was a rising tide of forgery. The newly issued £ or £ notes were amagnet for criminals, but the peculiarities of the eighteenth-century legal systemmade the Bank not only victim but also detective and prosecutor. This requireda significant operation to manage not only note issue but also identification offorgeries and detection and prosecution of the forgers (McGowen , ;Wennerlind ).The result of this rapid expansion of the Bank’s various businesses was an urgentneed to increase its workforce. From a complement of around  in the mids, the number of clerks employed had increased to over  in  (Giuseppi, p. ; Kynaston , I, p. ). This undoubtedly made the Bank’s staff thelargest concentrated white-collar workforce in the world. Much like a civil service,together the Bank’s clerks constituted a body of knowledge and experience thatremained constant while directors and governors of the Bank came and went. Eachoperated in a specialised capacity in offices supervised by senior colleagues, andheavily coordinated with each other, thus making the organisation of work at theBank akin to that in a large factory. Individually, the jobs those clerks performedwere mundane and repetitive but collectively the feat they achieved, that of managingthe national debt and providing banking and discount facilities for London’s businessand financial community, was nothing short of extraordinary. Moreover, this was alabour force that, until the advent of the typewriter and the automated bookkeepingmachine in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and indeed, arguablyuntil the advent of the computer, could not be replaced or even significantly aidedby technology. Their work was done by hand in processes that involved theendless recording of details in ledgers and checking and double-checking to ensurethe integrity of the records.Although the skills of London’s financial workforce have been acknowledged inrecent studies, little attention has been given to the development and quality ofthose skills (Cassis ; Michie ). Perhaps because of a scarcity of sources, theclassic studies of banking development and the institutional histories of individualbanks have given little space to the work of the clerks (Akrill and Hannah ;Checkland ; Crick and Wadsworth ; Pressnell ; Sayers ). Norindeed has the eighteenth-century emergence of the white-collar worker com-manded the attention of historians. Indeed, McKinlay dates the emergence of the‘banking career’ as late as the  years prior to  (McKinlay ). Even whenthey have been considered, early clerks have been characterised as a ‘marginalgroup’ (Heller , p. ). In consequence, most of the historiography has concerneditself with the lives of Victorian clerks, especially during the later nineteenth centurywhen their lifestyles and status supposedly came under threat from a rapidly expandingpotential workforce, the seeming downgrading of the status of clerical labour andANNE L. MURPHYeventually the influx of women into clerical work (Anderson , ; Heller; Lockwood ; Orchard ).This article offers an insight into a much earlier set of white-collar workers throughan examination of the backgrounds and skills of the men interviewed by the Bank ofEngland between  and , a period when both it, and the banking sector moregenerally, was undergoing significant expansion (Pressnell , p. ). It draws on aunique set of sources preserved in the Bank’s archives. These include ledgers contain-ing details of the initial interviews with applicants for clerical positions. The ledgerscovering the period from  and  include  interviews with  unique indi-viduals:  sons of former and current clerks and menwith no familial connectionto the Bank. Although the exact details recorded during each interview differed, theledgers generally recorded some standard information, notably place of birth, age,religion and marital status. Candidates were also asked to confirm that they werefree from debt and that they did not belong to any associations, such as politicalclubs. In many cases candidates provided information about their schooling and pre-vious career histories. Some also gave details about their families, including theirfather’s or mother’s occupation. The interview ledgers can also be cross-referencedwith separate ledgers in which were recorded the results of tests performed by eachapplicant. Not all candidates can be traced in these ledgers but test results can befound relating to nearly  of the  interviews thus offering a significantly largesample from which to draw conclusions. Together the two sets of ledgers allowthe construction of a detailed picture of the labour force available to the early nine-teenth-century Bank of England.The men who emerge through these records may have been a marginal groupwhen measured against the rest of London’s, and indeed Britain’s, early nine-teenth-century workforce (Lindert and Williamson , p. ), but they werehighly significant at a point where sound management of the national finances waskey to British military and geopolitical success. Trust in public finance and a newlyestablished paper currency rested largely upon the efficient functioning of the Bankand thus ultimately on the shoulders of the Bank’s clerical workforce. This articleis the first to explore this aspect of the functioning of the fiscal-military state andalso the first study of early nineteenth-century white-collar workers. What followswill firstly explain the Bank of England’s recruitment process. Section II will discussthe clerks’ backgrounds. Sections III and IV will focus on skills, considering thebroad scope of skills to be found among the potential workforce and the results ofthe Bank’s tests of its applicants. Section V will consider the means used by theBank to bridge the obvious gaps between the skills it required of its workers andthose possessed by applicants for its posts. Finally, section VI concludes.IEmployment at the Bank of England was attractive. The Bank offered a regular salarythat compared very favourably with other similar work and was paid quarterly in cash,‘WRITES A FA IR HAND AND APPEARS TO BE WELL QUAL I F IED ’ something that was not always available to other workers (Boot , ).1 By it was also acknowledging that it was impossible to get by on less than £ perannum and, therefore, it supplemented salaries that fell below that point through gra-tuities that could be earned by diligence and regular and timely attendance (Acres, II, p. ). Pay could be further enhanced in some offices by payments for over-time, bonuses paid by the Bank, and gratuities from grateful customers. Over the longterm, earning potential was very good with salaries rising in regular increments oncean initial, and informal, training period had been completed. The taking of a secondjob was also permitted so long as it did not interfere with work at the Bank (Acres, II, p. ). Moreover, although there were some redundancies after the conclu-sion of the NapoleonicWars, for the most part, work at the Bank offered job security.The Bank’s directors allowed clerks to work well into their old age. It also grantedgenerous pensions to those who it let go or who wished to retire and to those whowere unable to work through accident or physical or mental incapacity. A lifetime’scareer in the Bank of England would ensure a secure place in the middle to uppermiddle ranks of society (Boot , p. ). For all these reasons, although, as weshall see, there might have been a shortage of the precise skills required by theBank, each vacancy could certainly have been filled by a willing hand many timesover.There was, however, no public advertisement of vacancies at the Bank. Men couldonly be considered by recommendation of one of the directors or by virtue of beingthe son of an already long-serving employee. It seems probable that many of thedirectors had a fairly steady stream of young men making contact with them andthey chose the most promising, most well-connected, or the most pushy, of thosemen to put forward when an opportunity presented itself. As such, access to a positionat the Bank, initially at least, was about who you knew, and howwell you were able toexploit that connection, rather than what you knew. This was certainly typical ofemployment practices in other similar businesses, such as insurance and the EastIndia Company (Bowen , p. ; Supple , p. ). But it does not meanthat employment practices were poorly considered or determined solely by patron-age. The social bonds that determined introduction arguably acted as a stronginitial screening mechanism and, in the longer term, may have reduced the risk ofmalfeasance. In industries like banking and insurance, therefore, personal recommen-dation continued to be a common requirement for employment well into the twen-tieth century (Anderson , p. ; Heller , p. ).The Bank’s recruitment procedures had always been quite rigorous (Murphy). From the early nineteenth century, however, procedures were enforcedwith greater vigour. After  when it required additional hands, the Bankappointed a committee from among its directors to interview the applicants. As anintroduction to the Bank each candidate was asked to prepare a petition outlining1 Bank of England Archive (henceforth BEA), M/ Minutes of the Committee for House andServants, –, see, for example, fos. –; see also Schwartz , p. .ANNE L . MURPHYhis fitness for the position. Unfortunately, none have survived in the Bank’s archivesso the precise nature of these documents is not known. This also means that we havelittle information about the reasons why the candidates had applied to the Bank,except when the more unusual cases were noted in the interview record. SurelyWalpole De St Croix was somewhat ill advised in the claim he made in his applicationthat he wanted to give up his position because he felt himself aggrieved when hiscurrent employer had docked his wages for being late to work a few times.2William Smithyman was on equally shaky ground when he informed the committeethat service at sea for the East India Company had convinced him that he was ‘betterleading a sedentary life than an active one’.3 Those candidates whose reasons were notdeemed worthy of record must have instead emphasised the attractions of a steadywage, long-term job security and the prestige of working for the country’s premierfinancial institution.On the day of the interview each candidate was subject to a test, conducted by thechief accountant, of the candidate’s ability to deal with money, an interview with acommittee of the directors, and was then asked to provide a sample of his writingand work with accounts in front of the committee. On completion of the interviewand testing process, the committee made their recommendations which then wentforward to the Court of Directors. The final decision to employ or reject restedwith them. Nonetheless, failure to secure employment at the first attempt was notnecessarily the end of the story. Many men made a number of applications to theBank, often working in the interim to repair any defects noted by the interviewingcommittee.Of those whowere rejected by either the committee or the Court of Directors, agewas one stumbling block. From  the Bank set a minimum age of  and amaximum age of  for its applicants. Thus Frederic Reid was rejected at his firstattempt to enter the Bank because he was not yet .4 Some candidates werefound to be unqualified. Hence George Lettis who had worked as a warehouseman,run the Spotted Dog public house in the Strand and then worked for six months for amilitia insurance office was ‘Disqualified from his want of ability and also on accountof the situations he has held’.5 Only one man was rejected because of a physical dis-ability: Charles Burrows was found to have a serious speech impediment, so much so,that he took his father to the interview to speak for him. His recommendation waslater withdrawn.6 Some men lost their chance by succumbing to anxiety.

His name did not go forward to the Court of Directors.7Overall, however, the rejection rate of applicants to the Bank was very low. Over per cent of the men interviewed during the period under consideration wereoffered employment. Although giving the impression that the process lacked rigouror was merely a rubber-stamping of favoured directors’ choices, as the followingsection will demonstrate, the interview process was challenging. The low rejectionrate was, in fact, symptomatic of another factor: during this period the Bank wasexpanding rapidly and the skills it required were in short supply.I IThe details preserved in the Bank’s interview records allow us to construct a detailedpicture of the candidates who applied for positions. The average age of those with nofamilial connection to the Bankwas . and the average age of those applicants whowere sons of former or current clerks was .. The age range of the applicants wasbetween  and . Those who were under-age at the time of initial interview wereusually invited to return when they were older. The upper age limit of  was some-times relaxed. It is clear that the committees were aware of the possibilities of cheatingthe system. William Gibbs was fortunate to be able to produce proof of his age as theCommittee noted that he looked unusually young.8 John Wall, apparently aged ,was suspected of having altered his certificate to get past the Bank’s upper age limit.9Nonetheless, there are a number of indications that age was difficult to prove, andsometimes difficult to know, in a period prior to the introduction of compulsoryregistration of birth. Thus, John Way, a Trinitarian, was unable to produce acertificate of his age and had instead produced an affidavit signed by his father inthe presence of the Lord Mayor.10 This was not just a problem for dissentingProtestants. Samuel Frame was unable to find the register of his birth despitehaving looked through the books of several parishes.11As Table  shows, the majority of applicants to the Bank were born in London andthe south-east suggesting, as might be expected, a largely regional market for clericallabour. Nonetheless, there were also a number of applicants drawn from all over thecountry and from farther afield. This should not surprise. The draw of London foreconomic migrants, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and indeedmuch earlier, is well established (Harding ; Wrigley ). London remained,even by the early nineteenth century, the driving force behind Britain’s economyand the place where the highest concentration and variety of jobs could be found.7 BEA, M/,  Dec. .8 BEA, M/,  Jan. .9 BEA, M/,  Feb. .10 BEA, M/,  May .11 BEA, M/,  Jul. .ANNE L . MURPHYLondon also drew in workers from outside Britain’s borders and thus the Bankattracted candidates who had been born, grown up and even started their careers inBritain’s nascent empire and other major centres of trade. Thus, applications werereceived from men born in Hamburg, The Hague and Bruges.12 John JosephBlake was born and grew up in the East Indies.13 Cheney Hamilton and JohnRobertson were both born in Jamaica.14 The candidate from farthest afield wasHenry Martin Johnson born in  in New Holland (Australia). Henry was theson of Reverend Richard Johnson, the first clergyman to serve the new congregationof convicts and their guards.15 Henry must have been one of the first European babiesto be born in Australia.As might be expected of a cohort that included men in their late s and early s,some of the men applying to the Bank between  and  were married andmany of those had children. Table  shows the marital status of the applicants.There is no evidence that the Bank preferred married men, indeed the majority ofthe applicants were single:  per cent of applicants with no familial connections tothe Bank and  per cent of the sons of former clerks. There are, however, some indi-cations that the interviewing committees might have harboured doubts about theTable 1.

Hence -year-old Henry Pownall’s father reported tothe committee that his son was ‘very steady and not inclined to Company’.16As Pownall’s father’s assertion suggests, the ideal clerk was a man whose reputationheld no hint of poor behaviour, profligacy, temptation to fraud or embezzlement norindeed the likelihood of political or religious activism. All candidates were askedabout their religious and other affiliations that might have conflicted with their loy-alties to the Bank in its own regard and as representative of the state. And all men werequestioned about their financial stability.As Table  shows, the majority of men were of the established church. Variousdenominations of dissenters were represented and their relatively high showingamong the sons of clerks suggests that the Bank did not discriminate against them.On the other hand, there were no Catholic applicants to the Bank. This waslargely a reflection of demography. It has been estimated that by  only  percent of the British population was Catholic (O’Gorman , p. ). But theBank of England had also, on the discovery of a ‘Papist’ employee in , introducedrules that prevented the employment of Catholics. There is no sign that the gentlemanin question, Thomas Macdonnell, was anything other than an exemplary employeebut with the Jacobite rebellions fresh in their minds, the Directors at the time wereclearly not taking any chances. Catholics subsequently were not considered forposts within the Bank until after the Catholic Emancipation Bill of  (Acres, p. ).Men were also asked about clubs to which they might belong. This line of ques-tioning probably emerged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and particularlywith the rise to prominence of radical societies, such as the London CorrespondingTable 2.

Unsurprisingly, no men in the sample preserved in theexaminations books admitted belonging to any political clubs although a coupledid note membership of friendly societies and Samuel Field confessed to being amember of a card club that met once a fortnight in the Furnival Inn.17Indebtedness was a different matter. Men who were at the time of the interview inbusiness for themselves were quizzed carefully about their credit-worthiness and thestability of the enterprise. Thus Charles Russell revealed that he was making his livingas a bookseller and was married to awomanwho had two children from a former mar-riage. He noted that, if offered the job at the Bank, his wife and her son would carryon that business. Russell also revealed that he had around £ in demands againsthim but book debts sufficient to meet those demands and a £ per annumannuity from his wife. His account satisfied the committee.18 A number of menadmitted to being discharged bankrupts. William Smith Oakley had been in thewool business with his father but they had been made bankrupt. Oakley couldproduce his certificate of discharge.19 James Jackson had been a linen draper buthad become bankrupt with debts of £. He had managed to pay his creditors shillings in the pound.20 In considering the applications of discharged bankrupts,the Bank was following English law, which granted bankrupts who fully cooperatedTable 3.

The nineteenth-century view was that occupations recruited chiefly from ‘the children of thosealready employed in it’ (J. S. Mill quoted in Leunig, Minns and Wallis , p.). Studies focusing on earlier periods have drawn similar conclusions. They havetended to argue that ‘options were restricted by parents’ resources and their networksof acquaintance’ (Thomas , p. ) and that a clear tendency towards ‘occupationalinheritance’ existed (Mitch , p. ). The fact that so many sons of existing clerkssought work at the Bank would also suggest that some vestige of a system of ‘occu-pational caste’ was in operation. Nonetheless, the occupations of the parents of theapplicants with no familial connection to the Bank show significant diversity. Theinterviewing committees recorded parental occupations in  cases, mostly relatingto fathers’ occupations, but mothers’ occupations were noted if the father was alreadydeceased. Among these individuals there were very few clerks. As Table  shows, theremaining parents appear to have been drawn from the higher artisanal classes andfrom the middling sorts but were engaged in varied occupations demonstrating thatoccupational caste held relatively little sway in the clerical profession. This alsopoints towards conclusions reached by more recent studies of apprenticeshipsshowing that labour markets in skilled employment were not heavily constrainedby social barriers (Leunig, Minns and Wallis , p. ).Because candidates were drawn from a range of backgrounds, sons of serving clerksexcepted, it is pertinent to ask what methods men used to get noticed by their nom-inating directors. Although little specific evidence can be found, some routes wereobvious and it is possible to speculate about others. Naturally some directors nomi-nated their own servants and clerks to positions in the Bank. Such was the case forThomas Wickstead, nominated by the director Mr Whitmore, who also gaveWickstead a ‘very good character’.21 As was typical in recruitment to other similarorganisations, some candidates would have been introduced to directors throughthird parties. Friends, business partners or acquaintances might have recommendedeither their own employees or perhaps their sons or some other family member forpreferment (Makepeace , pp. –). Churches and non-conformist meetinghouses might have been another locus for making connections. There is also someevidence of networks of patronage. Thus, of the  applicants with no familial con-nection to the Bank,  had some connection to Reading. The Bank’s records alsoreveal a director, Edward Simeon, with strong connections to Reading. It seemslikely then that it was known in the area that Simeon was willing to recommendlocal young men for positions.Although, potential clerks or their fathers did not necessarily move in the samesocial circles as the Bank’s directors, another route to contact might have beenthrough an existing job.

But booksellers, haberdashers, clerks to wine merchants ormen working in one of the City’s coffee houses would also have encountered a widevariety of people through their work and perhaps been noticed by or indeed foundthe courage to talk their way into a better position. The latter strategy, of course,was a risky one since it encompassed both the risk of rejection by the Bank and alien-ation of a current employer. Such was almost the fate of William Thetford, whoapplied to the Bank in . Thetford was dismissed by his previous employer ‘onaccount of his application to be taken into the Bank’.22 Fortunately the storyended happily, William and his brother John were both offered positions at the Bank.The range of middling sort and artisanal backgrounds from which applicants to theBank were drawn points clearly to expansion of the clerical class at this time. This wasa necessary consequence of the need to meet the demands of the fiscal-military state.For applicants this undoubtedly brought the advantage of somewhat lower entry bar-riers to work at the Bank. For the Bank itself, this created more of a problem because,as the following sections will demonstrate, there was a clear gap between the skills itrequired and the skills available amongst the existing workforce.I I IModern studies emphasise that formal education is an important factor in the devel-opment of human capital (Becker ). Yet, the quality of school education availableat the end of the eighteenth and start of the nineteenth century was often inadequateto the task of instilling the skills needed for clerical work. Traditional grammar schoolsstill concentrated on offering a classical education. A more ‘modern’ education mighthave included English and mathematics perhaps with some attention to the human-ities, foreign languages and those other socially valuable skills of drawing and dancing.Commercial schools placed more emphasis on the skills that were required of Bankclerks: being able to write a good hand and basic maths and bookkeeping. Yet, inall areas of education, abuses and neglect were common and provision at secondaryand higher levels was generally poor (Langford , pp. –; Mitch , pp.–). In consequence, only a very small proportion of the population wouldhave had more than a few years’ formal schooling (Wallis , p. ).Nonetheless, most applicants to the Bank appear to have had a school education.Only one man from the sample confessed to a university education. Ames SimonCottle received his bachelor’s degree fromMagdalen College, Cambridge. The com-mittee recorded that his handwriting was ‘not fine’.23 Other candidates mentionedspecific schools such as the Blue Coat schools, Christ’s Hospital and Charterhouse.Thomas John Jones had been educated at the Naval Academy in Chelsea.24 Scott22 BEA, M/,  Dec. .23 BEA, M/,  Sep. .24 BEA, M/,  Sep. .‘WRITES A FA IR HAND AND APPEARS TO BE WELL QUAL I F IED ’ Francis, aged , had been at a college in Rheins in Champagne for five years but hadbeen unemployed since his return to England a year previously.25 HenryWyburd wasthe only candidate who mentioned being educated by a private tutor, undoubtedly amore expensive option for Wyburd’s parents or guardians (Langford , p. ) but,in this case, money relatively well spent. Wyburd was acknowledged to be quick atfigures and have the potential to improve his handwriting.26 John Dance had beeneducated by his father, who did not do such a good job, Dance was noted as onlyhaving ‘tolerable’ handwriting and being ‘middling’ at accounts.27The questionable value of formal education during this period suggests that lengthand level of schooling was not, and could not be used as, a reliable indicator of attain-ment and ability by the Bank’s interviewing committees. It was perhaps for this reasonthat, as we shall see, such a great emphasis was placed on the testing of applicants. Itwas perhaps also a reason why so few men applying for a position at the Bank ofEngland were embarking on their first position since leaving school. Indeed, giventhat the average age of candidates was around  among men with no familial con-nections to the Bank and around  among sons of clerks, this suggests prior workexperience of between three and seven years, assuming a school leaving age ofaround  or .Although evidence is not plentiful, the Bank of England does appear to havebeen unusual in preferring to recruit men with work experience. Bowen’s studyof the East India Company, for example, suggests some candidates for employ-ment were often just  or  years of age (Bowen , p. ). Sayers alsoemphasised the employment of school leavers at Lloyds Bank (Sayers , p.). Checkland noted the use of an apprenticeship system in the Scottishbanks from the early nineteenth century, with the National Bank at least stipu-lating that its clerks should be no younger than  but no older than  years ofage (Checkland , p. ). In other public banking systems too, youngermen were preferred. The starting point for workers in the public banks ofNaples during the eighteenth century suggests a maximum age of , clearlyindicating a desire to train young men in the ways of the bank (Avallone, p. ). This system was also characteristic of more recent banking recruit-ment even in environments, such as Australia, where suitable labour was in veryshort supply (Seltzer and Simons , p. ).Although the diversity in parental occupations noted above is also reflected in theoccupations of candidates, we do find a large concentration of applicants from otherbanking houses or what might be termed complementary occupations. As Table shows, around  per cent of applicants were working as clerks or bookkeepers, incounting houses, other banking houses or in the law, insurance or education or25 BEA, M/,  Jun. .26 BEA, M/,  Mar. .27 BEA, M/,  Jul. .ANNE L . MURPHYgovernment offices such as the Customs House or the Excise Office. These occupa-tions offered the potential for the acquisition of transferable skills that might have beenan advantage for those applying to the Bank, but one man had gained skills that wereclearly a concern to the committee. Charles Marcuard had been employed for fiveyears as an engraver, thus having acquired one of the key skills of a banknoteTable 5.

Marcuard’s application was referred to the Court of Directors before beingaccepted.28The Bank did also draw in a large number of applicants with apparently no relevantprevious work experience. Richard Hughes, for example, was a landscape painter atthe time of his application.29 James Allanson from Knaresborough, north Yorkshire,was the son of a farmer and was noted to be living and working with Mr Tucker andCo., plate manufacturers.30 John Chappell had been brought up to be a stationer withhis father and apparently had never been away from his family.31 Hughes, Allansonand Chappell were all regarded as having promising qualities. However, JohnCarman, an umbrella maker, was found to have only ‘indifferent’ handwriting andhis application was rejected.32Men with no relevant work experience sometimes received training or moved intojobs that would allow them to pick up banking-related skills before applying to theBank. Thus, Andrew Fenoulhet had been a hatter and hosier but had receivedthree months training in accounts and writing and declared his intention to continuethat training in the evenings after his working day was finished.33 Robert DodgeBarton had been a tallow chandler but hadmore recently become a clerk in his brother’swine merchants. He was judged to be able to write well but was not ‘ready’ withaccounts.34 Charles Parry, a hatter, was rejected at his first attempt to enter theBank in June  and subsequently sought employment writing out and settlingaccounts. By his second interview, his handwriting was improved.35 Other mentried to emphasise relevant transferable skills, such as Thomas Reynolds who,although employed as a haberdasher, claimed to spend much of his time ‘copyingout manuscripts’.36Adding to the list of those whose previous work experience was not always usefulto the Bank were a significant number of men whowere either unemployed or seem-ingly underemployed at the time of their application. There is no evidence that theBank disadvantaged unemployed applicants. Indeed, around  per cent of applicantsclaimed to be unemployed at the time of interview. Such was the case for GeorgeBaldwin, aged , who had been out of work for around six months at the time ofhis application.37 Samuel Rickards, aged , had been two years in town and wasstill not in employment.3828 BEA, M/,  Aug. .29 BEA, M/,  Sep. .30 Ibid.31 BEA, M/,  Oct. .32 BEA, M/,  May .33 BEA, M/,  Jul. .34 BEA, M/  Jun. .35 BEA, M/,  Jun. ;  Mar. .36 BEA, M/,  Jun. .37 BEA, M/,  Jun. 38 BEA, M/,  Mar. .ANNE L . MURPHYSome of the interviews with unemployed men also point to the precariousness ofbusiness life during the early nineteenth century. Hence Charles Castleman had beenapprenticed to a wine merchant whose business had failed. Castleman had beenunable to find full employment since and was currently occupied in keeping thebooks for his uncle, a bricklayer.39 Charles was not the only applicant to hint at under-employment. Around  per cent of applicants claimed to have been employed inkeeping their father’s or brother’s books or assisting in a relative’s business in someother way. Others were just noted to have been with their father since leavingschool. Of course, we cannot be clear about what these men were doing; it maybe that they were indeed fully employed in the family business. Yet, if so, and if oper-ating as a valuable member of a family business, it seems unlikely that they would beseeking alternative employment.Early nineteenth-century unemployment rates are notoriously difficult to measureand what calculations have been done relate to labouring and agricultural employ-ment (Feinstein , p. ; Voth , p. ). These calculations, however,suggest an unemployment rate of around  per cent during the early years of the nine-teenth century and prior to the mass demobilisation that took place at the end of theNapoleonicWars. This means that the Bank’s records indicate unemployment amongthe higher artisanal occupations and middling sorts was much higher than the norm.Of course, the evidence is hardly conclusive and it might point to no more than ashifting pattern of working for the middling sorts, away from predominant self-employment or semi-employment in a family business towards full-time employ-ment in the service of another. There is insufficient evidence here to speculatefurther but one thing is clear: high unemployment rates did not automaticallybring the Bank a cheap labour force of skilled workers.IVThe result of the Bank’s tests confirm that the skills it required were possessed by rela-tively few. As noted above, the Bank imposed three tests on candidates: a test of theirhandwriting, a test of their ability with accounts and a test of their ability to ‘tell’money. The specifics of the tests have not been preserved but we can speculate thatgood penmanship required a neat legible hand, the ability to write without leavingblots on the paper, and the ability to copy without error. Indeed, errors were to beavoided at all costs because of the potential association of the erasure of errors withfraud (Jeacle , p. ). Speed was also important and the committees oftenpraised expeditious hands. With regard to accounts, candidates had to be competentin simple mathematics and to understand double-entry bookkeeping. The Bank’s test,however, appears to have involved the addition of columns of figures. In the handlingof money, candidates had to be able to recognise numerous different forms of specieand notes and understand their value. Thus the test of ability with money appears to39 BEA, M/,  Jun. .‘WRITES A FA IR HAND AND APPEARS TO BE WELL QUAL I F IED ’ have consisted of a requirement to compute a number of ‘parcels’ of cash and it wasmeasured by speed, in number of minutes taken, and accuracy by number of parcelscomputed inaccurately.The handwriting and accounting tests were measured only by speed, in number ofminutes taken to complete the tests, and the committees recorded a subjectivecomment on accuracy or quality of the work. The test results reveal considerable vari-ation in the ability of candidates. Among candidates with no familial connection tothe Bank, time taken to complete the handwriting test ranged from  to minutes and time taken to complete the addition test ranged from three to minutes. With regard to the test of telling money, times taken ranged from  to minutes and only . per cent of candidates ( out of the  tests that can betraced) managed to complete the tests without error. The sons of clerks who, itmight be argued, with advice from their fathers had the opportunity to make amore effective preparation for the tests, did little better. Amongst the sons, timetaken to complete the handwriting test ranged from  to minutes and to completethe addition test from two to  minutes. The time taken to complete the tests oftelling money ranged between  and  minutes and only two men, . per centof the total number of sons of clerks, managed to calculate the parcels without error.The test of telling money offers a fascinating insight into the difficulties of dealingwith the monetary environment of the late eighteenth century which encompassednot just current English coin but some much older and a great deal of foreign coin aswell as a wide variety of banknotes. Even accounting for this and the nervousness ofcandidates, the very low percentage of men who were able to pass the test withouterror is significant. Moreover, as Figure  shows, the results were not skewed by afew very poor performances, in fact performances were highly variable and, in par-ticular, show that the ideal of the ‘fast and accurate’ cashier was not available to theBank at point of entry. Indeed, a closer examination of those men who completedthe test without making any errors shows that the average time taken to completethe test was . minutes, indicating that steadiness rather than expedition was thekey to accuracy for those men. They were equally steady in their other tests. Theaverage time taken by them to complete the writing test was . minutes andthe average time taken to complete the addition test was . minutes. SamuelField was quick, completing the writing test in  minutes and the addition test infive but was judged by the committee to be ‘not ready’ with regard to addition, aphrase that seemed to indicate inaccuracy.40 Only eight men out of this groupreceived unequivocally positive remarks from the committees.Nonetheless, if we regard the  men who managed to complete the tests withmoney without error as being amongst the most highly skilled that the Bank couldacquire, it is possible to draw some conclusions about how these skills were acquired.It is notable, for example, that the average age amongst this group was with over per cent of the group being over the age of , thus suggesting that long work40 BEA, M/,  Mar. .ANNE L . MURPHYexperience was one of the keys to skill acquisition. Equally, the majority of this groupwere working at the time of interview in banking or similar occupations. Only six outof the  members of this group whose previous occupation was recorded wereengaged in seemingly non-compatible work, this included a farmer, a baker, andoyster netter, the superintendent at St John’s chapel and -year-old John WilliamMackintosh who was still in school.As shown in Table , extending such assumptions to the entire cohort of applicantstends to support the finding that performance improved with the age, and arguablythe experience, of the candidate. There were nonetheless no very significant differ-ences in performance. Table  also confirms that, while the sons of former and existingclerks in the – age bracket performed slightly better at addition and tellingmoney, the Bank in fact derived no particular advantage from employing menwith a familial connection to the Bank. The clerical class, therefore, did notprovide a ready-made next generation of workers.Table  shows performance in the Bank’s tests grouped by the previous workexperience of the applicants. Occupations were coded as providing or not providingrelevant, office-based, skills, such as work in banking, in counting houses, as clerks, ininsurance, government offices and schooling. Men were coded as unemployed orunderemployed if they admitted to being out of work at the time of interview,said that they were working intermittently or just described themselves as being‘with their father’. The results displayed in Table  show that, while once again thedifferences were not great, men with previous relevant work experience couldFigure .

The test of telling money revealed somewhatdifferent results: men working in non-relevant occupations did slightly better thanthose in office-based work. Here we may assume that men working in the retailsector or small-scale manufacturing might have come into contact with coin andnotes more regularly than men undertaking some office-based roles. Again,though, the dominant finding is that there was no significant advantage to theBank in seeking out men with office-based work experience.The results of the Bank’s tests confirm the white-collar skills shortage which hasbeen observed in the work of other scholars. This was a shortage that apparently per-sisted into the middle of the nineteenth century (Boot , p. ; Sayers  p.). Especially during the period from  to  this presented a particularproblem for the Bank. As we have noted its business was expanding rapidly andthus it had to recruit large numbers of clerks quickly. It, therefore, had to rely on strat-egies other than the location of skilled recruits to preserve its business.VThe foregoing discussion has established that the Bank’s ability to copewith the strainscreated by the Napoleonic Wars did not originate in the skills of its entry-level clerks.Arguably, therefore, we must consider how the Bank set about transforming a set ofapplicants, many of whom had no clear natural aptitudewith accounts or money, intoan effective workforce. Although no details of the Bank’s training systems can betraced, it is possible to speculate on several factors that might have allowed the insti-tution effectively to manage its workforce: the creation of an internal labour market,the establishment of systems to monitor staff and encourage diligence and the special-isation of the Bank’s functions.An internal labour market is characterised by limited points of entry into employ-ment, internal promotion to fill senior positions, career longevity and transparent paypractices (Seltzer ). The Bank of England displayed all these characteristics:throughout its early history it recruited only at entry level and trained men on thejob, apparently, as and when needs required. Senior men had all worked their wayup through the ranks and were paid based onmerit and seniority. Arguably an internallabour market offered the Bank several advantages in dealing with an entry-levelworkforce with questionable skills. First, it meant the creation of a middle andsenior rank of men with long experience of the Bank’s procedures and processeswho were ready and available to supervise and train newcomers. Although somewhatanecdotal, the career trajectory of MrWalsh of the  per cent Consols office reportedto a Committee of Inspection in  is instructive. He told the Committee:That he had been  years in the Bank, & for the last  years one of the  Chief Clerks of thisOffice, being appointed Assistant to Mr Miller & Mr Vickery. That when he first came intothe Bank, he was placed in the department of the Chief Cashier where he went through theANNE L. MURPHYOffices of OutTeller & InTeller, & was some time at one of the Cash books & assisted in theBullion Office at the time of taking in the deficient Gold Coin; he was afterwards removedinto the Accountants Office, which he went through; & from thence to the  P CtConsols, where he has seen every part of the business before he was appointed one of theChief Clerks.41Such men acquired a deep knowledge and skill set that they would have been able topass on to more junior members of staff.Next, the creation of an internal labour market meant that the Bank could avoid arising premium for buying in skills throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centur-ies. It could keep its junior members of staff relatively low-waged and reward theacquisition of skills and seniority. Finally, the reward of skill acquisition and seniority,rather than just ability, is now regarded as an important factor in maintaining themorale of employees and ensuring effort over the lifetime of a career (Seltzer andSimons , p. ). The Bank did indeed tend to retain its workers, many ofwhom had very long careers within the institution. Thus, the Bank reaped the ben-efits of its investment in its clerks. For the clerks, on the other hand, rewards could beslow to materialise implying that that the Bank tended to attract workers willing totake a long-term view on the returns for their labour.The second factor that allowed the Bank to operate with underskilled entry-levelworkers was systems of monitoring and reward and punishment to encourage loyaltyand diligence. The development of a level of intermediate management has beennoted above. While the chief accountant and chief cashier, answering directly tothe Court of Directors, had overall responsibility for work at the Bank, each officeappointed a senior man and often supervisors who were responsible for the day-to-day management of the offices. In addition, periodically from the s, the Bankappointed its directors to Committees of Inspection whose role was to examine theoperation of the Bank and the fitness of its staff. From  three permanent commit-tees were established having oversight of the Stock Offices, the Printing and BankNotes Offices and the Cash Offices respectively. Although the effectiveness ofthese modes of oversight cannot be measured, it is clear that the committees operatedto expose the Bank’s systems and its staff to regular scrutiny and that swift response tothe discovery of serious failings was expected.At an individual level, the Bank operated systems of rewards and punishment for itsstaff. Clerks could be made financially responsible for errors that led to losses for theBank. Each clerk was also expected to provide the Bankwith personal security startingat £ for junior clerks and rising to a maximum of £, depending on respon-sibility. The Bank was diligent both in maintaining up-to-date records for guarantorsand pursuing compensation in the event of significant losses resulting from errors or41 BEA, M/, Secretary’s Department: Committee of Inspection Minutes, Nov.  – Mar., fo. .‘WRITES A FA IR HAND AND APPEARS TO BE WELL QUAL I F IED ’ dishonesty (Acres , I, p. ). On the other hand, bonuses were paid to rewardprompt and regular attendance, although pay was withheld to punish absence. Insome offices ‘overtime’ was paid on a piecework basis. Thus in the DiscountOffice clerks were allowed s d for every additional  bills posted after theirexpected daily work was completed (Acres , II, p. ). Efficient working was,therefore, encouraged by financial reward.The third factor that allowed the Bank to compensate for the lack of skills availableat entry level was the specialisation of its functions. As in the Discount Office, mostmen working at the Bank at junior levels spent their days engaged in mundane andrepetitive work designed to be coordinated with other members of individualoffices. While the language of skills has been used throughout the discussion so far,in fact, by most definitions, work at the Bank was not particularly skilled. In thisrespect, Green’s articulation of the complexities of defining skilled work in themodern economy is illuminating. It indicates that skill should encompass the negoti-ation of significant complexity or the application of thought, discernment and inde-pendent decision-making (Green , pp. –). Such functions would have beenrequired of relatively few roles at the early nineteenth-century Bank of England.Indeed, arguably what can be observed is a process of deskilling, such as apparentlyoccurred during industrialisation. In manufacturing, dividing processes into specia-lised steps meant considerably less investment in skill acquisition (Berg ; Mitch, p. ). Perhaps the same was true of work in the nineteenth-century Bankof England.VIThis study of the labour force available to the Bank of England at the start of the nine-teenth century shows that there was a clear over-supply of labour but no clerical classfrom which the Bank could draw its candidates for employment and certainly noover-supply of skills. This finding is consistent with broader studies of the labourforce in industrialising Britain, which although disagreeing about the size of thegap, still indicates a gap which points to underinvestment in human capital (Mitch, pp. –). This serious mismatch between the needs of the employer andthe skills of the potential workforce meant that there was a need for diligence inthe training and monitoring of new staff and a significant investment in humancapital made by the Bank itself. However, it is probable that it was not an investmentin broad training but rather a process of deskilling through the specialisation of theBank’s functions that allowed it to operate with relatively few workers who mighthave been defined as truly skilled.Submitted:  June Revised version submitted:  January Accepted:  February ANNE L.
