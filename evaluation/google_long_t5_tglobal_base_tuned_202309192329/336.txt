ABSTRACT: 
U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy\u27s underwater radiated noise signature was characterized in the central Arctic Ocean during different types of ice-breaking operations. Propulsion modes included transit in variable ice cover, breaking heavy ice with backing-and-ramming maneuvers, and dynamic positioning with the bow thruster in operation. Compared to open-water transit, Healy\u27s noise signature increased approximately 10 dB between 20 Hz and 2 kHz when breaking ice. The highest noise levels resulted while the ship was engaged in backing-and-ramming maneuvers, owing to cavitation when operating the propellers astern or in opposing directions. In frequency bands centered near 10, 50, and 100 Hz, source levels reached 190–200 dB re: 1 μPa at 1 m (full octave band) during ice-breaking operations.

BackgroundIcebreakers are designed to operate in ice-covered waterswith a strengthened hull, an ice-clearing shape, and the pro-pulsion power to push through consolidated ice. Convention-ally powered (i.e., non-nuclear) icebreakers have operatedsuccessfully on trans-Arctic voyages in summer as well as onscientific expeditions to high-latitudes in almost all regions ofthe Arctic Ocean. Although icebreakers represent a relativelysmall proportion of the total vessel traffic in the Arctic (50active icebreakers in the world fleet), they are invaluable forsurveying, oceanographic research, vessel escort in ice, sal-vage, pollution response, and search and rescue.The thinning Arctic ice pack and advances in ship designare allowing for longer seasons of navigation for both ice-breakers and other polar-class vessels (Jensen, 2007). Like-wise, an increasing number of research icebreakers areconducting geological and geophysical studies throughout theArctic Ocean related to establishing the limits of an ExtendedContinental Shelf under the U.N. Convention on the Law ofthe Sea (Arctic Council, 2009). Icebreaker activity will alsoincrease as mineral and petroleum resources are developed inthe offshore region (Jensen, 2007). Seasonal shipping trafficis expected to keep increasing in the near future due to indus-trial development as well as political and scientific interestsin the Arctic region, and the use of polar icebreakers couldsignificantly lengthen the shipping season (Arctic Council,2009). The potential for an expanding presence of ice-breakers in the Arctic motivates characterization of theirnoise signatures to better understand their future contributionto Arctic underwater noise.Compared to other vessels, icebreakers generate higherand more variable noise levels from propeller cavitation dueto the episodic nature of breaking ice, which often involvesmaneuvers such as backing-and-ramming into the ice. Someicebreakers are equipped with bubbler systems that blow high-pressure air into the water to push floating ice away from theship, creating an additional noise source over short ranges.Sound propagation under sea ice is an area of acousticsresearch that is complex due to scattering effects from ice,absorption of acoustic energy at the ice-water interface, andthe possibility that shear waves transmitted through ice mightre-radiate into the water column (Etter, 2003). Under icetransmission loss is largely unaffected by ice coverage atranges where direct path propagation is possible. Conversely,transmission loss is greatly affected at distances in which theonly propagation path requires at least one water-ice reflection(Milne and Ganton, 1964). Incorporating sea ice conditions,water depth, and sound speed profile may help to model long-range sound propagation in the Arctic Ocean and thereforepredict the ranges at which icebreaker noise may be detected.We present results from in situ shipboard experimentsdesigned to measure underwater sound pressure levels radi-ated by an icebreaker operating in the Arctic Ocean. Whilepast studies have measured icebreaker noise from stationarylocations near shore or on the ice, real-time acoustic moni-toring of an icebreaker has not previously been reported fora)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Source level esti-mates are reported while making comparisons with variousship operation parameters such as propeller shaft rotationsand speed-over-ground.B. Characteristics of the icebreaker HealyU.S. Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) Healy (WAGB-20) isone of the world’s largest non-nuclear polar icebreakers andwas designed as a high-latitude platform for conducting a va-riety of Arctic and sub-Arctic research. The ship is equippedwith an automated engineering plant, state-of-the-art naviga-tional equipment, extensive communication and computersystems, a voyage management system, and a modern suite ofscience systems (Berkson and DuPree, 1998).Healy was commissioned in August 2000 and has anoverall length of 128 m (420 ft), maximum beam of 25 m(82 ft), full-load draft of 8.9 m (29.2 ft), and full-load dis-placement of 16,400 LT (Berkson and DuPree, 1998). Theship’s propulsion is diesel-electric with an ac/ac cyclo-converter system. The generating plant consists of four Sult-zer (12Z AU40S) main diesel engines, while propulsionpower is provided by two fully reversing, variable speed,Westinghouse AC Synchronous drive motors (11.2 MW).The ship’s control includes two rudders and two fixed pitchfour-bladed propellers with a maximum shaft horsepower of30 000 horsepower (HP) at 130 revolutions per minute(rpm). Healy also has a 2500 HP bow thruster with Alstomdynamic positioning system. There is no bubbler system; abow-wash system was installed to lubricate the hull duringicebreaking, but it is rarely used.Healy’s cruising speed is 12 kn (6.2 m/s) at 105 rpmwith a maximum speed of 17 kn (8.7 m/s) at 147 rpm. Its ice-breaking capability was designed for breaking through1.4 m (4.5 ft) thick ice of 690-kPa (100-psi) strength at 3 kn(1.5 m/s) continuous, while actual (best) performance is1.7 m (5.5 ft) at 2.6 kn (1.3 m/s) continuous. Healy has pro-ven capable of breaking ice up to 2.4 m (8 ft) thick whilebacking and ramming. For the purposes of this study, wewill consider substantial coverage of ice that is 1.2 m (4 ft)thick or greater to present heavy ice breaking conditions. Ingeneral, however, the Healy is considered a medium polaricebreaker (O’Rourke, 2012).In summer 2008, a research expedition (HLY-0805)took place in the central Arctic Ocean to map the seafloor insupport of U.S. delineation of an Extended Continental Shelfunder provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Law of theSea (Mayer and Armstrong, 2008). During the HLY-0805cruise from August 14, 2008 to September 5, 2008, passiveacoustic monitoring of USCGC Healy was conducted duringice-breaking operations in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.These measurements were taken opportunistically bydeploying and tracking omnidirectional sonobuoys on a non-interference basis with the main science objective. An analy-sis of these recordings was conducted with the goal of esti-mating radiated underwater acoustic source levels duringdifferent modes of propulsion in various sea ice conditions.II. MATERIALS AND METHODSA. Data collectionThe study was conducted in the western Arctic Oceanwhile Healy was mapping the seafloor north of the ChukchiCap (Fig. 1). Typical water depths were between 3 and 4 kmover the “foot” of the continental slope—the area where thecontinental margin transitions into the deep seafloor. Passiveacoustic measurements were made between August 27 and31, 2008 when Healy’s navigation presented opportunities foracoustic studies. A total of nine sonobuoys were deployedduring moderate-to-heavy ice breaking and while the shipwas stationary during deep-sea dredging operations in waterdepths exceeding 3 km. Approximately 14 h of sonobuoyFIG. 1. Bathymetric map of the areafor measurements of U.S. CoastGuard Cutter Healy in the deep water(>3000 m) Arctic Ocean.

Portions of the sonobuoy recordings inclose proximity to the ship were clipped due to high noise lev-els and were not used for analysis. Although we assume thatnoise generated by the Healy’s propulsion and machinerydominate the radiated noise, the sounds of breaking ice mayalso be included in our recordings.B. Acoustic recording equipmentThe Sparton AN/SSQ-57B is a low frequency analysisand recording (LOFAR) sonobuoy that provides omnidirec-tional passive acoustic data between 10 Hz and 30 kHz. Thehydrophone depth was selected to be 122 m (400 ft) for noisemeasurements in deep water. A frequency modulated radiosignal was transmitted from the sonobuoys’ very high fre-quency (VHF) transmitter at the sea surface to an omni-directional antenna mounted atop Healy’s mast. Signalswere passed to an antenna splitter/amplifier, two ICOMR100 frequency modulated (FM) radio receivers, a SoundBlaster Audigy 2NX analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, andlaptop computer. The data were sampled at 48 kHz andrecorded using the real-time data acquisition software ISH-MAEL (Mellinger, 2001).Sonobuoys scuttle after 8 h, but more often they wouldfirst exceed the transmission range for sufficient VHF recep-tion (5 km). Because sonobuoys were not designed for ice-covered waters, several deployments failed as the pack icereconsolidated aft of Healy’s stern. The increase in surround-ing pressure sometimes caused damage to the surface elec-tronics or hydrophone cable. There were also instanceswhere Healy would reverse direction due to ice conditions,and the sonobuoy was either destroyed or experienced inter-mittent data loss due to contact with the ship.C.

An expected transfer function or frequency responsecalibration was computed based on the sensitivity of thetransducer elements in addition to the signal conditioningprovided by the amplifiers in the hydrophone, radio, andA/D converter. There was an uncertainty of 61–2 dB associ-ated with the calculated transfer function compared to themeasured calibration response. Once the transfer functionwas applied to the raw data, measurements were reported asreceived pressure levels (dB re: 1 lPa rms).D. Signal processingThe MATLAB-based (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA)software package TRITON (Wiggins and Hildebrand, 2007)was used for first-level signal processing to determinewhether data were clipped or not of suitable quality due topoor VHF radio transmission. In general, if the hydrophonewas within 1 km of Healy, the data were clipped and notused. When the sonobuoy was greater than 5 km from Healy,it became difficult for the radio receiver to acquire continu-ous data with good quality.Spectral measurements are calculated from 1 or 5 s sam-ples of continuous data with no overlap between each spectralaverage using the Goertzel algorithm to calculate power spec-tral densities from discrete-time fast Fourier transforms(FFTs). All spectra were processed with a Hanning windowand 48 000-point FFT length, yielding 1 Hz frequency bins.For comparative analysis, spectral measurements are reportedusing 1 Hz bins as well as 1/3 and 1 octave bands based on astarting frequency of 10 Hz. After correcting for transmissionloss, measurements are reported as source levels at 1 m.E. Source/receiver range and azimuthTo estimate source levels from measured received lev-els, range estimation from the ship to the sonobuoy wasrequired to calculate transmission losses. In correcting fortransmission loss, a range dependent spreading loss of20 log10(R) was assumed, where R is the source/receiverslant range in meters. Ray-trace refraction and reflectionanalysis was used to estimate the distance between Healy’ssonar and the sonobuoy hydrophone. The time differencebetween arrivals resulting from direct path and first bottomreflection of the ship’s 12 kHz echo sounder were measuredin the sonobuoy acoustic data. These direct-path/first-reflec-tion time differences were converted to ranges between theship and the sonobuoy through an iterative procedure inwhich an acoustic propagation model, incorporating themeasured sound speed profile, local water depth, and depthof the sonobuoy hydrophone, were adjusted until theobserved time difference was matched (Fig. 2 and supple-mentary Figs. 1 and 2).1 Over the relatively short propaga-tion ranges used for this study (1–5 km), we found that20 log10(R) was a good approximation for the transmissionloss. The geometry and range of our measurements are suchthat direct path propagation is all but guaranteed, and soundscattering or reradiating from the water-ice interface is notthought to contribute meaningfully to our measurements.FIG. 7.

Download to IP: 132.177.229.80 On: Tue, 24 Nov 2015 16:16:36Because the sonobuoys drifted due to pack ice move-ments, winds, and ocean currents, the relative bearing of thesonobuoy to the ship, and hence the azimuthal aspect of theship that was measured at any instant is not known. There-fore azimuthal variations in the ship’s radiated noise are notconsidered in the analysis. When directionality in ship-generated noise due to propeller cavitation has been previ-ously observed, it is described as a dipole with smalleramplitudes on the ship’s bow and stern (Arveson and Vendit-tis, 2000). Limited visual observations of the sonobuoydeployments indicated that the sonobuoy likely remainedabaft the beam when Healy was transiting. This may lead toslightly decreased measurements from those produced in ac-cordance with the ANSI standard (ANSI, 2009), whichspecifies measurements within 30 of the ship’s beam.F. Ancillary dataHealy is equipped with a ship-wide computerized datalogging system that records and stores data from the naviga-tion, oceanographic, engineering, and communications sys-tems. Several of these ancillary measurements were used foranalysis, including Healy’s position, heading, and speed overground, as well as environmental information such as thelocal sea ice coverage, which was estimated from time-lapseimages to the nearest 10%. The engineering data provided thetime along with corresponding port and starboard propellershaft speeds averaged from the cycloconverter readings andconverted from percentages to pure shaft rpm’s.III. RESULTSSeveral transient and continuous acoustic events wereselected as case studies for analysis that most accuratelyreflect Healy’s noise signature. Propulsion modes includetransit in varying pack ice conditions, backing-and-rammingmaneuvers, and dynamic positioning.A. Transit in variable ice coverDuring August 27, Healy transited from nearly completesea ice cover to an open-water polynya (Fig. 3 and supple-mentary Fig. 1). Healy’s transition from ice-breaking toopen water is evident at approximately 05:37 when propellershaft rpm’s decreased and speed over ground (SOG)increased as the resistance to movement abated in openwater [Fig. 4(A)]. A time series of source level estimatescentered near 50 Hz shows a decrease in mean level duringthe transition from ice-breaking to open water [at 05:37 inFig. 4(B)]. Moreover, large amplitude noise peaks [e.g.,05:22 and 05:24 in Fig. 4(B)] are reduced when the ship isoperating in open water.A comparison of source spectrum levels while Healy istransiting through 8/10’s and 3/10’s ice cover is shown inFigs. 5(A) and 5(B), respectively. At 10 Hz, both source spec-tra exhibit similar levels of about 182–183 dB re: 1lPa2/Hz at1 m (1 Hz bins). Above 20 Hz, however, there is a 10 dB dif-ference on average between the two source spectra. In ice-covered waters, the full octave band remains approximatelyflat between 100 and 300 Hz [Fig. 5(A)], while in open waterthe full octave band slopes steadily downward with frequencyup to 2 kHz [Fig. 5(B)]. In the 1 Hz bin spectra, underwaternoise levels are higher by as much as 15 dB between 200 Hzand 2 kHz during moderate ice-breaking conditions whencompared to open-water transit. In both spectra, elevated lev-els between 3 and 5 kHz are attributed to the acoustic chirpFIG. 8.

Narrowbandpeaks at 12 kHz are due to the ping produced by Healy’s Sea-Beam 2102 multibeam echo sounder.B. Backing-and-ramming in full ice coverOn August 28, a sonobuoy recording was made duringmultiple backing-and-ramming maneuvers [Fig. 6(A) andsupplementary Fig. 2]. Twenty-five minutes of the recordingwere analyzed while the ship was in consistent 8/10’s icecover [Fig. 6(B)]. The port and starboard screws were notoperated simultaneously in the same direction as the shipattempted to change its heading in the ice [Fig. 7(A)]. Thenon-synchronous operation of the two screws complicatedattempts to correlate rpm’s with source levels during this re-cording. Positive (i.e., forward) rpm movement and subse-quent increases in SOG characterize ramming. Negative (i.e.,sternward) rpm movement and subsequent increases in SOGcharacterize backing. The ship reached 6–7 kn (3.1–3.6 m/s)forward speed before progress was halted by the pack ice.Reversing the direction of the screws, the ship backed up,reaching speeds around 3 kn (1.5 m/s) before attempting tomake forward progress again. This alteration in SOG indicatesthat the ship was breaking heavy ice while making forwardprogress into the hole created by the previous ram.The modulation in SOG over the course of the recordingcorresponds with the source level time series shown in Fig.7(B). Healy’s noise signature was examined in frequencybands by orders of magnitude (i.e., centered near 101, 102,103, and 104 Hz), including one centered near 50 Hz, to see ifthe distribution of source levels was frequency dependent.For the time series centered near 10, 50, and 100 Hz, sourcelevels increased 10 dB in several instances, correlating withnegative rpm’s of one or both of the ship’s propeller shafts.The effect is shown to a lesser extent in frequency bandscentered near 1 and 10 kHz. The highest estimated sourcelevel reached during this recording was about 195 dB re:1 lPa at 1 m, in full octave bands at 10 and 50 Hz.Another recording was made during several hours ofHealy backing-and-ramming in heavy ice cover during Au-gust 28–29 [Fig. 8(A)]. Thirty-five minutes were analyzed,while the ship was in 9/10’s ice cover [Fig. 8(B)]. For thespectral time series centered near 50, 100, and 1000 Hz,source levels quickly increased 10–15 dB in several instances,again correlating with rapid deceleration of the ship from for-ward movements and sternward operation of the screws (Fig.9). However, in this case, the same effect also is seen with thehigher frequency band centered near 1 kHz. The highestsource level reached during this recording was about 200 dBre: 1lPa at 1 m, in full octave bands at 50 and 100 Hz.When the ship is engaged in backing-and-rammingmaneuvers, the largest modulation in Healy’s noise signatureresults from severe cavitation of the propellers while operat-ing astern. In bands centered near 10, 50, and 100 Hz, sourcelevels were shown to increase 5–15 dB during backing-and-ramming maneuvers. Specifically, noise levels increased10–15 dB in the 50 Hz and 100 Hz bands while operatingastern propulsion as compared to operating forward propul-sion while breaking ice.C. Dynamic positioning in full ice coverOn August 31, a recording was made during deep seadredging operations [Fig. 10(A)]. Twenty-five minutes ofdata were analyzed while the ship was using its bow thrusterFIG. 9.

Spectral estimates for fulloctave bands are centered around 56.6 Hz (40–80 Hz band), 113 Hz (80–160 Hz band), and 0.905 kHz (0.640–1.28 kHz band), respectively (gray sec-tion indicates loss of acoustic data).

Healy neverexceeded 1 kn (0.5 m/s) during this time, achieved by inter-mittingly applying short bursts to the throttle. These dataallow characterization of Healy’s source levels while usingits bow thruster to operate in a dynamic positioning mode.The ship was dragging the dredge up the seafloor slope,moving variably between 0.3 and 1.0 kn (0.2–0.5 m/s). Thepropeller blades were below cavitation inception so this con-tribution to the sound field was absent.A source level spectrum (Fig. 11) represents radiatednoise while operating the bow thruster in heavy ice cover.The bow thruster contributes significant narrowband spectralpeaks at 30 and 55 Hz, reaching source levels of 193 dB re:1lPa at 1 m in the full octave band. There are several har-monics associated with the 55 Hz peak at 110 Hz, 165 Hz, etc.Above 200 Hz, source levels drop to values similar to thoseseen in the open-water source spectra [Fig. 5(B)] except forfrequencies greater than 10 kHz where a noise peak of 178 dBre: 1lPa at 1 m is seen in the full octave band.IV. DISCUSSIONA. Variability in icebreaker source levelsBased on the ancillary data available for this study, indi-vidual propeller shaft speed (rpm) is a key parameter that canbe related to the ship’s acoustic power output as well as sea iceconditions. SOG can be a proxy for moving through ice butdoes not necessarily correlate with higher noise levels. Forinstance, there is no strong correlation between higher noiselevels and movement astern. The sources of higher noise levelsare correlated with rpm in the astern direction. When the shipattempts to turn by using opposing screws, higher noise levelsdo correlate with operation of one screw forward and the otherin reverse. Figure 12 shows Healy’s source levels, averagedfrom the recordings made between August 27 and 29. Thisplot shows that astern propulsion contributes most to highnoise levels and that operation of the screws in opposing direc-tions also contributes. Operating ahead, even when breakingice, does not typically produce high noise conditions.There are two scenarios in which noise levels are notice-ably higher—the first is when screws are operated in oppos-ing directions; the second is during backing and rammingwhen the screws are operated astern, particularly when theship begins to impact the ice. Higher noise levels correlatepositively when both screws are operated astern together. Inaddition, it seems that the SOG in the astern direction peaksand then starts to slow and that the higher noise levels beginwhen the slowing occurs but with no change in rpm. Thisimplies that the ship is beginning to impact the ice behind itand may be pulling ice debris into the propellers.The highest source levels occur during backing-and-ramming, reaching 190–200 dB re: 1lPa at 1 m (full octaveband at 10, 50, 100 Hz), correlating with sternward operationof the screws during backing maneuvers (Figs. 7 and 9).Cosens and Dueck (1993) also noted in their study of ice-breaker noise that the highest levels occurred when the ice-breaker was going into reverse. During backing andramming, source levels increase when the ship quickly tran-sitions from reverse to forward propulsion.B. Propeller cavitation and other noise sourcesCavitation of marine propellers from surface ships is themost prevalent source of underwater sound in the oceansFIG. 10.

Depending upon the operating cavitation pa-rameter, each propeller blade produces cavitation for a shortperiod when their angles of attack are less than the nominaladvance ratio. The resultant burst of cavitation noise is brief.Because one blade invariably cavitates sooner than theothers, the bursts first occur once per revolution. As the otherblades begin cavitating, the noise bursts become more fre-quent, finally occurring at blade rate—the number of bladesmultiplied by the rotational frequency.Cavitation inception usually depends more on the shipwake than on the design of the propeller. For severe wakes,stall is likely to occur when the propeller blade passes behindthe stern post, or so-called “shadow zone” (Ross, 1976). Ice-breakers are unique in this regard as they invariably encoun-ter a situation during backing and ramming where the ship’spropeller shafts are rotating at nearly full speed, yet the SOGof the vessel falls due to increased resistance from pack ice.At this moment, there is not only stagnant fluid flow in theshadow zone but everywhere around the propeller. The dropin dynamic pressure of flow velocity around the propellerblades causes increased cavitation inception simultaneouslyfor all the propeller blades, resulting in the highest noise lev-els produced by the icebreaker.Other noise sources are propulsion machinery and dieselgenerators. Diesel-electric drives—like the propulsion sys-tem found on Healy—employ four-stroke medium-speeddiesels that are quite noisy compared to slow-speed direct-drive engines and produce multiple tones attributed to pistonslap. These four-stroke medium speed diesels can radiate asmany as 100 harmonics of their rotational frequencies (Ross,1976). This noise source usually becomes important when aship is operating at slow speeds, for example, whenFIG. 12.

For this reason, Healy’s engines are locatedon the main deck to reduce noise for the sonar systems.Ross (1976) has suggested that the total noise radiatedby a surface ship may be estimated fromSPL ¼ 126 þ 15 logðHPÞin dB re: 1lPa at 1 m;where HP ¼ horsepower. As an example, if Healy’s maxi-mum shaft horsepower is 30 000 HP at 130 rpm, then thesource level would be about 193 dB re: 1lPa at 1 m, which issimilar to those peak values presented here for low frequen-cies during low SOG when operating in pack ice.V. CONCLUSIONSThe presence of sea ice represents a significant obstacleto vessels operating anywhere in polar waters, and requiresspecially constructed ships and navigational skills (Brigham,2000). The thinning Arctic ice pack is allowing for longer sea-sons of navigation for icebreakers and other polar-class ves-sels. Increases in vessel traffic around the Arctic Ocean mayresult in an increase in the risk of disturbance from ship noiseon migrating and foraging whales as well as other marine ani-mals. In an effort to better predict these risks, protocols forthe measurement of radiated ship noise (ANSI, 2009) shouldbe expanded specifically to icebreakers operating in polarregions with ice-covered waters. Combined with a more thor-ough understanding of under-ice acoustic propagation, stand-ard measurements such as these will allow better managementof our shared Arctic resources.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSSupport for the field program was provided by the Centerfor Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center(CCOM/JHC) and the U.S. Coast Guard.
