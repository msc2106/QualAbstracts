ABSTRACT: 
Ghana's 2008 election has been hailed by national and international observers as a model for Africa. The perception of success has prevailed despite persistent concerns about an inflated voters' register and electoral fraud perpetrated by the two major parties, the NPP and NDC, in their strongholds in the Ashanti and Volta Regions respectively. Electoral malpractice in Ghana's virtual two-party system could acquire a decisive importance as a ‘third force’, representing an even more important factor than the smaller opposition parties. Unfortunate diplomatic and technocratic biases in election monitoring, combined with a reluctance on the part of the responsible authorities to investigate what appears to be a long history of fraudulent voting, amounts to a dangerous time bomb of unresolved conflict which could detonate in future elections.

There was also a de-monstrable increase in the oversight function of civil society organisationsand the media. The outcome of the parliamentary and presidential elec-tions of December 2008 was hailed by stakeholders, the national andinternational media, diplomatic missions and international scholars alikeas another step forward in consolidating multiparty democracy in Ghana,and as a model for the whole of Africa (Gyimah-Boadi 2009; Loetzer &Mo¨nikes 2009: 95; Whitﬁeld 2009). Yet persistently inﬂated voters’ regis-ters and block voting remained a concern, at least with respect to thestrongholds of the two major contesting parties.1 Some observers of the2008 election have deplored the ‘growing ethnicisation’ of Ghanaianpolitics, considered to be a heavy burden on the country’s on-going de-mocratisation process. This is in spite of a long-standing tradition withinGhanaian political culture of frowning on ethnic appeals, and variousprovisions within the constitution and the electoral law (Political Parties Actof 2000) designed to prevent ‘ tribalism’ (Loetzer & Mo¨nikes 2009: 77–8).2There exists a long-standing controversy about block voting, and howimportant swing voting has been in Ghana’s Fourth Republic (1992–2009).The size of the core voting population in Ghana had been considerable, atleast in the 1996 and 2000 elections (about 82% of the voting population;see Lindberg & Morrison 2005: 565). Nevertheless, swing voters broughtabout the ﬁrst democratic alternation of power in 2000, thus challengingassumptions that voting volatility in transitional regimes is higher than inrelatively consolidated African democracies like that of Ghana. There areno robust data available to test whether the percentage of swing voters haschanged since the early 2000s. Ghanaian core and swing voters cannot bedistinguished by structural factors, like level of education, the rural–urbandivide, income and occupation, possibly apart from ethnicity.3 In any case,strong block voting in two regions persisted. Ashanti (NPP) and VoltaRegions (NDC) (Fridy 2007: 282, 286–9; Morrison & Hong 2006: 235,239) have never voted against the political tradition associated with theirregion – the Busia-Danquah tradition in Ashanti, and the Nkrumahisttradition in Volta – following the demise of the Ewe uniﬁcation movementin the 1950s. This pattern has been repeated since the ﬁrst fully democraticelection in 1996, a trend which was conﬁrmed once more in 2008.Together both regions represented a signiﬁcant proportion (26.6%) of all96 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187registered voters (12,472,758) in Ghana in 2008. Ashanti has the secondlargest proportion of voters at 18.5%, behind Greater Accra with 20.2%.The Volta Region accounts for 8.1% (EC website ; see also Fig. 1).4On-going concern is reﬂected in claims and counter-claims about elec-toral fraud. Although the total number of votes involved was possibly quitesmall in 2008, the closeness of the result meant that vote massing couldwell have jeopardised the legitimacy of the entire process. The most recentelection proved again that Ghana is virtually a two-party system (seeFig. 1), possibly because of the peculiarities of its British-style electoralsystem (multiple single-member constituencies ; see Morrison & Hong2006: 631–2), reinforced by competing Ghanaian political traditions basedon ideology and related socio-economic divisions between ‘Nkrumahists ’and ‘Busia-Danquahists ’. Expectations that one of the smaller oppositionparties could break through as a third force were again disappointed(EU EOM 2009; Loetzer & Mo¨nikes 2009).The history of Ghana’s electoral processes shows that, at least in popularperception, ethnicity matters more than any other socio-economic variable(Fridy 2007: 281, 302; Tonah 2009). Fortunately, during this (and previous)elections this did not result in large-scale election violence as in otherAfrican states like Kenya, Zimbabwe or Nigeria. Many voters view thetwo major parties, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the NewPatriotic Party (NPP), as representing mainly Ewe and Ashanti interestsrespectively (Loetzer & Mo¨nikes 2009: 64, 78). However, in reality, therelationship between ethnic politics and partisanship is far more complex.Factors other than ethnicity, notably socio-economic issues, dominateactual voting patterns in Ghana (Fridy 2007; Lindberg & Morrison 2008;Nugent 2001b).Nevertheless, persistent block voting in the Ashanti and Volta Regionsis a reality. Its eﬀects are compounded by a level of electoral malpracticedesigned to stack up additional votes in areas of strength. Vote rigging inregional party strongholds could acquire a decisive importance, possiblyrepresenting an even more important ‘ third force ’ than the smaller op-position parties or the factor of invalid votes.5 The sheer number of votesthat can be mobilised by each group may serve as a useful indicator. Thediﬀerence between valid votes in the ﬁrst and second rounds in the AshantiRegion amounted to 241,284 (2.7% of the national total and 12.6% ofregional valid votes in the second round respectively), and in the VoltaRegion to 68,184 (0.8% of the national total, or 9.3% of regional validvotes). Both parties attributed the increases to extraordinary mobilisationeﬀorts in the election campaign before the ﬁnal round. However, there arestrong indicators that a signiﬁcant part of the increase is due to electoralTH E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 97http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187malpractice, as will be shown in the following sections. By comparison, thecandidate of the largest of the small opposition parties, Paa Kwesi Nduomof the Convention People’s Party (CPP), gained 113,494 votes in the ﬁrstround of the 2008 presidential election. In the ﬁnal round a mere 40,586votes tipped the scale in favour of Atta Mills.F I G U R E 1Ghana 2008, presidential run-oﬀ election.Number of valid votes, share of each candidate, and turnout (%) by region.Source : EC-Ghana, Accra.98 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187Against the background of growing conﬂicts due to a new nationalism (cf.Kohnert 2009) informed by the politics of belonging in Africa in general,and recent electoral violence in Kenya and Nigeria in particular, the praisefor thepeaceful 2008 election inGhana is understandable.However, despitethe impression of a generally free and fair election, serious malpractices andelectoral fraud seemingly occurred. Again the most contested results camefrom Ashanti and the Volta Region. Not all allegations were investigatedsuﬃciently.6 The international community inside and outside Africa was atpains to have a positive example to hold up, a model for Ghana’s Africanpeers to emulate. Rare were slightly critical remarks like those of the EUElectoral Observers, for example with respect to the implausibly highturnout in ﬁve Ashanti constituencies, and the lack of transparency in thetransmission of aggregated ﬁgures (EU EOM 2009: 29). The EC, whichwould have been responsible for in-depth investigations, shied away – forunknown reasons – from opening this can of worms. Possibly it lacked bothtime and resources for a thorough investigation, or thought it wiser not totouch these questions because they would not aﬀect the overall results. Thefact that the EC has not honoured an earlier promise to release detailedpolling station results suggests a preference for sweeping embarrassinganomalies under the carpet.7However, although comprehensible in view ofthe tense political situation at that time, this neglect could seriously distortthe picture of what actually took place, and threaten Ghana’s politicalstability and democratic consolidation in the medium and long run. This isthe more so because it was apparently not the ﬁrst time that the EC dis-regarded probable election rigging in the Ashanti, Volta and NorthernRegions, where similar unusually high turnout ﬁgures of over 90% ofregistered voters were recorded in the 2004 presidential election.8 Could itbe that oﬃcials and international observers of the Ghanaian 2008 electionalike were blinded by the quest for an African success story? Whatever thetruth of the matter, the outcome is fraught with perils for the future.Because both the NDC and the NPP believe that the other side perpetratedfraud in their strongholds and got away with it, it is highly likely that theywill try to do so on an even greater scale in 2012. This raises the prospects ofelectoral violence and the delegitimation of the electoral process, unless thematter is dealt with in an open and impartial manner.D I P L O M A T I C A N D T E C H N O C R A T I C B I A S I N E L E C T I O NO B S E R V A T I O N I N G H A N A’ S 2008 E L E C T I O N?The peaceful and largely transparent outcome of the 2008 election was toa large extent due to the strong commitment and active engagement ofTH E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 99http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187Ghana’s media and civil society, which monitored and commented on theelectoral process with great zeal. Think tanks, advocacy groups, religiousand professional organisations, and NGOs, comprised an impressiveplatform of independent coverage of the polling process, assisted by ad-vanced technology, meant for regular updates of local and regional results,parallel vote tabulation via mobile phone text messages and local radiostations (Gyimah-Boadi 2009: 145–6; Loetze & Mo¨nikes 2009: 80–2). Thecontribution made by the Coalition of Domestic Election Observers(CODEO) was of singular importance. All the actors concerned weremindful of what could go wrong, in light of the recent Kenyan experience.9The overall evaluation by international election observers, whose presencewas similarly enhanced by the Kenyan crisis and early problems with thevoters’ register, reﬂected these positive inputs.10 But other considerationswere also at work. Overriding concerns about political stability in the sub-region, and conﬂict prevention in view of the volatile political situation inneighbouring Coˆte d’Ivoire and Togo, may have enhanced the tendency toaccentuate the positive. Thus, a certain diplomatic bias cannot be deniedfor the Ghanaian case.11 An additional technocratic bias,12 notably a dis-regard forGhanaian election history as well as informal politics, and a focusexclusively and excessively on formal procedures of multiparty democracy,apparently blinded impartial observers to the realities on the ground.One case in question is the long-standing controversy about the inﬂatedvoters’ register and its connection with the unusually high turnout ﬁguresin the run-oﬀ election in numerous constituencies of the Ashanti, Voltaand Northern Regions in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections.13Kuenzi and Lambright (2007: 684–5) have observed in general a positiverelationship between electoral experience and voter turnout in multipartyelections in sub-Saharan Africa, but this is complicated by the fact thatturnout was also higher in Africa’s less democratic regimes, comparedwith the democratic ones. In Ghana, similarly high turnout ﬁgures werereported for the 1996 and 2004 presidential elections in the Ashanti andVolta Regions (EC website). In the 2000 presidential election, the ﬁrstdemocratic polls which brought an alternation of power (this time fromNDC to NPP), turnout was relatively low. Nevertheless, allegations aboutelectoral irregularities, a bloated voters’ register, and patterns of voterturnout, notably in the Volta and Ashanti Regions, were already rife.14Controversies over the integrity of the voters’ register have become aregular feature in Ghana’s elections, and have led in some cases to politicalcrisis. For example, the 1992 election was marred by opposition allegations(mostly unsubstantiated) about a ‘stolen verdict ’, followed by its boycott ofthe December legislative polls. In the 2000 election the voters’ register had100 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187been grossly inﬂated, especially in the Greater Accra, Ashanti and VoltaRegions. The reasons given focused on double registration in diﬀerentregions, fraudulent registration of minors and the deceased as major prob-lems, resulting in an estimated 1.5 million ‘ghost voters ’ (Smith 2002:624–31). Even during the 2008 election campaign, out of a total of12,822,474 registered voters, 349,496 entries were removed by the ECbecause they were considered as irregular (see also EU EOM 2009: 14–16).The EC had expected to register an additional 800,000 voters since 2006,the year of the last update of the register, which corresponded to estimatesof the number of citizens who had attained voting age. However, the 2008provisional register listed nearly an additional 2 million voters (Ichino &Schu¨ndeln 2009: 5). Again the highest increase in registered voters duringthe limited registration exercise of the EC (from 31 July to 13 August 2008)was to be observed in the Ashanti Region: 374,451 new voters were re-corded, an increase of 330.7% over the 2006 exercise. The provisional voterpopulation for the region increased however by only 18.7% to 2,381,214voters compared with the 2006 electoral roll.15 For the whole of Ghana thetotal increase of the number of voters was 16.7% to 12,822,474.16 CODEO(2009: 34) concluded in a statement issued on 4 August 2008 that violenceduring voter registration and irregularities had been ‘widespread’. In viewof a persistently bloated register, notably in Ashanti and Volta Region, theabnormally high turnout ﬁgures are even more diﬃcult to credit.Although barely credible turnout ﬁgures were criticised in the ﬁnal re-port of the EU Election Observation Mission (2009: 29), this critique wasnot as exhaustive as it could have been. In fact, a total of nine con-stituencies in Ashanti, two to four in Volta, and one each in the Central,Eastern and Upper West Regions, showed questionable results, withAshanti by far the greatest suspected culprit (Tables 1, 2).17 A similarpattern was to be observed in the 2004 presidential election when, forexample, at least ﬁve constituencies in Ashanti produced dubious turnoutrates, most of which were problematic in 2008. The same was true ofat least three constituencies in the Northern Region, including two re-porting 95%, as well as three in the Volta Region.18 It is certainly notby chance that these inconsistencies recurred mainly in those regionswhere the inﬂuence of block voting remains most entrenched. Registrationfraud and concomitant inﬂated turnout ﬁgures are probably more likelyin party strongholds than in competitive areas (Ichino & Schu¨ndeln 2009:10, 16).It is open to question whether the questionable results were cross-checked by the EC or other responsible authorities, and what actions havesince been taken to remedy the situation. It is conceivable – but not veryTH E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 101http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187TA B L E 1Ghana presidential election 2008: Ashanti region, results of doubtful validity (a) : 1st round (7.12.08) & run-oﬀ (28.12.08) (c)Ashanti1st round 2nd roundTurnout %Constituency NPP NDC Valid votes Turnout % Reg. voters NPP NDC Valid votes Turnout % 2ndx1st roundAﬁgya/Sekyere East 33,855 9,240 43,623 77.29 57,040 40,788 9,641 50,429 89.15 +12Bantama (b) 40,493 7,649 48,690 70.90 69,215 56,227 8,532 63,759 93.81 +23Atwima-Kwanwoma 33,324 6,013 39,766 77.69 51,995 39,147 6,564 45,711 88.42 +11Kwabre East 43,329 10,473 54,288 75.06 73,222 50,502 11,796 62,298 85.68 +11Kwadaso (b) 44,341 8,069 52,950 70.65 75,488 62,110 8,876 70,986 94.47 +24Manhyia (b) 66,116 18,835 85,896 71.47 121,082 95,281 20,210 115,491 95.71 +24Nyiaeso S.M.

The worst-casescenario is that a perception of impunity, inﬂuenced by ethnicity in al-ready volatile constituencies and in certain regions, will encourage en-hanced electoral fraud in future elections. Those who commentedfavourably on the elections pointed out that the Election Commissioner,Dr Afari-Gyan, scored a tremendous achievement in producing a legit-imate result. At the height of the disputed run-oﬀ, his strategy appears tohave been to call the bluﬀ of the NPP by accepting disputed results fromAshanti and then pointing out that these were not enough to overturn themajority that had been chalked up by Mills. When the NPP insisted thatthe Tain constituency, where there had been no voting, could still aﬀectthe outcome, he called their bluﬀ again and agreed not to declare theresult until the election had been rerun there. No doubt, this was evidenceof deft footwork, but the point remains that the ﬁnal result was arrived byglossing over allegations of signiﬁcant electoral fraud. The precedent thathas been set is a dangerous one, and there is no guarantee that a futureCommissioner will be as ﬂeet of foot in future.In the next two sections, we examine the elections in Ashanti and theVolta Region in closer detail. These were the regions where the mostserious allegations were made, but it is important also to consider theatmosphere in which the polls were conducted.

In these two regions, there was abundantevidence for this mistrust in 2008, which does not bode particularly wellfor the future.T H E C A S E O F A S H A N T I R E G I O NThere was never any doubt that the chances of the NPP being re-electedin 2008 hinged on retaining the absolute loyalty of the Ashanti Region as avote bank, as party oﬃcials readily admitted. One consideration waswhether the NPP could retain the sympathy of voters in parts of the regionthat were more recent converts to the party cause. In Ashanti, there havehistorically been two weak links. One is at the geographical margins, re-ﬂecting deeper historical dynamics of ‘Greater Asante’. In the 1996presidential poll, the NDC won a majority in three constituencies innorthern Ashanti and two in the south. In the ﬁrst round of the 2000presidential election, only Ejura Sekyedumase and New Edubiase resistedthe NPP. In the second round, John Kufuor only failed to carry the latterconstituency for the NPP. If support for the government were to erode,however, an adverse swing was always possible in these marginal con-stituencies. Secondly, Ashanti has witnessed considerable levels of immi-gration, from the Volta Region but more particularly from the north. TheZongo communities have tended to vote NDC. Hence the Asawase par-liamentary seat in Kumasi was captured by the NDC in 2004, despite itspoor showing elsewhere.A real concern for the NPP campaign team was that Ashanti votersmight not turn out to vote for an Akyem presidential candidate, even ifthey remained broadly disposed to the NPP as a party. Hence turnout wasalways regarded as a prime consideration. Nana Akufo-Addo broughtprominent Ashantis into his campaign in order to reassure voters that theparty remained ﬁrmly rooted in its tradition as an Ashanti/Akyem al-liance. The team staged big rallies in Kumasi and larger urban centres, inan attempt to persuade voters that it retained enthusiastic support in theregion. The fundamental question of how many Ashanti voters there ac-tually were was dogged by controversy from the start. Before the reopen-ing of the voters’ register, the NDC complained that the ﬁgures forthirteen Ashanti constituencies were massively inﬂated. In April, the ECset up an independent committee to investigate this claim. Dr Afari-Gyaninitially lent credence to NDC fears when he conﬁrmed that the increasein the number of voters in Ashanti was not credible, but in June he revisedhis assessment. He announced that the incorrect ﬁgures, which were theresult of a printing error, only existed in hard copies of the register that had104 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187been sent to parties, and were not replicated in the EC’s own database.Although this supposedly meant that there should be no further cause forconcern, the NDC believed that any error was deliberate, and would bebrought into play later on. The problem was compounded when the re-gister was reopened to allow those who had attained full voting age to addtheir names. The NDC alleged that there had been systematic attempts topump up the numbers in Ashanti, through a combination of double andunder-age registration. Therefore, the opposition parties remained ex-tremely sceptical about the ﬁgures. During the campaign, Rawlings notsurprisingly returned to the claim that there was a plot to rig the election,centred on Ashanti. The fact that some large question marks remainedover the process disposed many opposition supporters to believe the worst.The election campaign in the region witnessed a few incidents of viol-ence, but some of these involved rival candidates for NPP parliamentarynominations, as was the case in Bekwai. On the whole, the campaignpassed oﬀ with little trouble. In the ﬁrst round of voting in 2004, Kufuorhad captured 1,235,395 out of 1,679,664 votes, which translated into 73.6%of the votes in Ashanti. In the ﬁrst round in 2008, Akufo-Addo won1,214,350 out of 1,677,285 votes, amounting to 72.4%. By contrast, Millshad won 398,362 (23.7%) of the votes in 2004, whereas in 2008 this hadincreased to 438,234 votes, or 26.1% (see Table 1). In other words, regionalturnout had dipped slightly, but this was to the disadvantage of Akufo-Addo. Mills, on the other hand, had seen his total number and share of theAshanti vote increase. The NDC had also managed to take its number ofparliamentary seats back to three – New Edubiase, Ejura Sekyedumaseand Asawase – while two NPP rebel candidates had won as independents.All of this was understandably a matter of considerable alarm to theNPP campaign team. Akufo-Addo supporters privately complained thatthe relatively low turnout in Ashanti had cost Akufo-Addo a ﬁrst roundvictory, which he only narrowly missed with 49.1% of the national vote.There was also some dissatisfaction at the failure of Kufuor to play a moreactive role on the campaign trail, which may have been rooted in hishistorically strained relationship with elements of the Ashanti political elite(Elischer 2008), and his earlier support for Alan Kyerematen as the partycandidate. In the run-up to the second round, Kyerematen, who hadbrieﬂy resigned from the party, was brought in to head the campaign inAshanti in the belief that he held the key to a higher turnout – despitebeing a Fante. A special appeal was made to Ashanti voters to preventRawlings from staging a comeback on the coat tails of Mills. The Millscampaign meanwhile hoped to make modest gains in Ashanti, whileconsolidating the swing elsewhere.TH E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 105http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187In the ﬁnal analysis, Akufo-Addo achieved what he was hoping for inAshanti during the second round. The total vote in Ashanti rose to1,880,372, with Akufo-Addo taking 1,401,421 (74.5%) and Mills 478,749(25.5%). Akufo-Addo had therefore conjured up another 187,071 votes andincreased his overall share, whereas Mills had increased his numbers by amere 40,515. If the balance of forces had remained the same in the otherregions, the additional votes (just over 1% of the national total) would havepushed Akufo-Addo over the winning line. As it happened, the gains inAshanti were wiped out by the swing to Mills in all the other regions,including Brong-Ahafo that had gone to the NPP in round one. Thequestion that arises is whether the NPP campaign team genuinely im-proved its performance in the second round, or had resorted to illegitimatetactics. It has to be said that the results in certain constituencies lookextremely suspicious. At Manhyia, where the recorded turnout was95.7%, the NPP vote rose from 66,116 in the ﬁrst round to 95,281 in thesecond (+24%). At Nhyiaeso, where the alleged turnout was 98.3%, itrocketed from 37,043 to 54,545 (+26%); and in Suame it climbed from47,768 to 67,790 on a 95% turnout (+24%; see Table 1). The total turnoutﬁgures for Ashanti (83.3%) were out of line with the ﬁgures for the rest ofthe country (72.7%). Interestingly, the turnout in Akufo-Addo’s own re-gion, Eastern Region, stood at only 72.2%. Given the closeness of thecontest, these increases could well have been enough to determine theoverall result.Perhaps voters in Ashanti genuinely feared a return of the NDC morethan other Ghanaians. Yet recorded increases in electoral participation,leading to very questionable turnout ﬁgures at the constituency level,should have caused concern among international observers. It is unlikelythat massive fraud occurred at the level of individual polling stations, giventhe strong presence of CODEO and international electoral observers.However, there may have been manipulation and intimidation in thosepolling stations or constituencies where NDC polling agents withdrew onpolling day. The transmission of results from the constituency level to theElectoral Commission headquarters provides much broader scope forelectoral rigging. This is conﬁrmed by evidence in other countries, whereelections have taken a violent turn in the post-poll period. The claim thattwo diﬀerent sets of results were received in the EC ‘strong room’, withthe second revealing much higher ﬁgures than the ﬁrst, has never beenproperly explained. What is even more suspicious is that the regional oﬃceof the EC appears to have deliberately held back from declaring a numberof Ashanti results.19 By releasing the NPP’s bombs at the end, the NDCclaimed, it was possible to claim victory at the last gasp: that is, once it was106 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187known how many votes were still required to concoct a victory. There issome plausibility to this reading of what happened, because a relativelycomfortable Mills majority suddenly evaporated as the last results came in.It was not enough as it happened, but the NPP came close to snatchingvictory at the last gasp. Interestingly, the constituencies that declared lateincluded those where there was an implausible turnout : notably Nhyiaeso(98.3%), Kwadaso (94.5%), Manhyia (95.7%) and Suame (94.7%).The NDC complained bitterly about these ﬁgures, and for some hoursthe entire election teetered on the brink of crisis. But after the Tain resultwas declared, Afari-Gyan announced on 3 January 2009 that the EC hadinvestigated and concluded that the NDC had failed to produce suﬃcientevidence in the shape of complete polling station returns for the disputedconstituencies. In reality, this was a mammoth task, especially when somepolling agents had not been present at the ﬁnal count. Although the NDCwas still deeply unhappy, it had been declared the overall winner anddecided to live with the Ashanti anomalies rather than provoke a crisis.Nana Akufo-Addo, on the other hand, was urged by Kufuor to acceptdefeat with good grace rather than resorting to the courts or direct actionon the streets. The NPP’s own complaints about the Volta Region weresimilarly dismissed. Since then, the EC has shown no inclination to revisitthe issue of electoral malfeasance. It has oﬀered no explanation of theturnout ﬁgures, no reason for the late declaration of certain Ashanti re-sults, and has failed to mount a complete set of results on its website thatwould enable Ghanaians to judge for themselves. These are seriousshortcomings that might come back to haunt the country in the future.T H E C A S E O F V O L T A R E G I O N20Before going into detail, it bears repeating that irregularities in the form ofabnormally high registration rates in some constituencies, bloated voters’registers, abnormal increases in voter turnout in the run-oﬀ election(notably in southern constituencies dominated by the Anlo-Ewe), riggingand ethnic block voting have a history in the Volta Region.21 This is ahistory which has coloured NPP perceptions of the likelihood of being ableto contest on a level playing ﬁeld.The hope of NPP activists in the Volta Region for a reversal of theirhistoric fortunes was based on a number of considerations. In the 2004election, the party succeeded in winning a parliamentary seat in NkwantaNorth for the ﬁrst time.22 The NPP strategy was accordingly focused onminority areas, where they aspired to win at least four constituencies :Nkwanta North again, Nkwanta South, Krachi East and Krachi West, asTH E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 107http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187well as Ketu North in the southern part of the region where the regionalminister was running. NPP oﬃcials boasted of their impartial record ofconcern for the welfare of the whole region: for example, they pointed outthat their government had built a Polytechnic College in Ho which oughtto signiﬁcantly redress the perception of marginalisation. Their partyoﬃces were very well frequented and their public meetings well attended,all of which gave the impression that they had managed to make inroadsin the region. Nevertheless, there was a common belief that public moneyhad been diverted by a corrupt national government to other regions thatwere better endowed with basic infrastructure like roads, schools andhospitals.The NPP exploited the advantage of incumbency in the Volta Region.For example, apart from the usual distribution of large numbers ofT-shirts, they provided school books in the villages, traditional presents tothe chiefs and queen mothers, and – at least according to usually reliablelocal informants – also cash as an incentive to vote for the ‘right ’ candidate.Some money was allegedly used to bring registration oﬃcers ‘on board’.23The deal was said to involve the registration of anyone brought by theparty with no questions asked, including ‘minors ’, and to place potentialopposition voters on a ‘wrong’ list of voters. This was precisely whathappened in Hohoe during the registration process, where two employeesof the Regional Electoral Commission (REC) were arrested by police onthe grounds of manipulating voters’ lists.24 According to information re-leased by the police, the accused confessed to having taken money fromNPP. However, no complaint about the registration process was broughtto the knowledge of the EU observers, though they especially asked for itin the villages. Other fraudulent practices concerned ballot papers meantfor NDC strongholds that would be rendered useless by printing mistakesand subsequently be rejected by NPP party agents. This happened in a fewplaces (e.g. in Nkwanta District), but its net eﬀect was only to delay thevoting process, and not to hinder it completely. In addition, the NPPorganised so called ‘party youth’ in a number of constituencies like KrachiEast, with the aim of harassing opposition and election oﬃcials. Thishappened speciﬁcally in Dambai.In the ﬁnal analysis, the REC was able to secure an acceptable electionprocess. Apart from Buem Constituency (Jasikan District), all constituencyresult sheets were signed by representatives from both parties. In Jasikan,NPP agents failed to turn up for the tabulation process. The ReturningOﬃcer claimed that NPP party oﬃcials told them to stay away. The re-sults in the Volta Region showed a NDC landslide, to no one’s greatsurprise. Apart from Nkwanta North, all the other parliamentary108 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187constituencies went to the NDC. There were only minor incidents, as inKrachi East, where the car taking the ballot boxes to the regional oﬃcewas attacked and the boxes stolen. Since the Presiding Oﬃcer carried thesigned result sheets, the REC was able to announce the results.Not much was seen in the local arena regarding the upcoming run-oﬀbetween the presidential candidates, by contrast with the heated discus-sions on TV, radio and in the newspapers about electoral rigging in theVolta and Ashanti Regions. NPP oﬃcials claimed that the election in theVolta Region had been marred by fraud, and stressed that their partyagents had been harassed and had not been allowed to take up theirduties. Some of these allegations were repeated by NPP oﬃcials at theconstituency level. What casts some doubt on the claims is that NPP agentshad signed all result sheets except one at the tabulation centres. It wouldhave been easy for the REC in Ho to clarify matters, but the EC answeredsolely in general terms and did not refer to any concrete allegation. Thiswas left to the press, but because journalists’ movements were quite re-stricted due to ﬁnancial constraints, many cases were not investigated. Inthe end, the claims became part of the stock of NPP propaganda to dis-credit the NDC in the run-oﬀ.Two days before the second round, a group of about a hundred so-called ‘Macho Boys’, that is NPP sympathisers, were brought in fromAccra. When asked about their role in the election, the mainly young menclaimed to be working as polling staﬀ. However, they had no idea aboutelection procedures. The EU observers met them close to Kpando town,where they were lodging, and had a long discussion with a large number ofthem. On voting day they were brought to polling stations, where theyoften met local party agents who refused to be replaced by them. Thecontext was one in which the national party organisers believed that theiragents in the region were likely to be susceptible to pressure, whereasoutsiders would perform a better job. Not surprisingly, the accreditedagents from the region took exception. Only two agents per party wereallowed inside a polling station at any given time. Some of the ‘MachoBoys’ ﬁrst came to their assigned polling station by late afternoon. Theirnames on the party’s list of oﬃcially authorised party agents had oftenbeen replaced or overwritten. This was why many Presiding Oﬃcers didnot allow them inside the polling station. Others, who had been allowedinside, later refused to sign the result sheets. Evidence procured by REC aswell as a number of oral admissions to the EU observers suggested thatNPP party agents told them not to sign, though they could give no con-crete reason for their refusal.25 The constituency result summary sheetswere not signed by NPP agents in three cases : Ho Central, North DayiTH E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 109http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187and Keta. In Anlo, these outsiders were chased away by townspeople in afraught atmosphere. There was a deep-rooted perception in the regionthat the ‘Macho Boys’ had been brought in to interfere with the demo-cratic process. The background was that a prominent chief, known for hiscritical stand vis-a`-vis the government, had been killed a few weeks before,and the government was blamed. The police explained that they escortedthe young men out of town because of security concerns, while the RECclaimed that this was not their responsibility. In short, the ‘Macho Boys ’caused a lot of ill-feeling and were the source of many rumours in theVolta Region, although in the end their presence did not have much eﬀectsince the procedures in place were working.26 Nevertheless, comparedwith the ﬁrst round, when the NPP secured 9.2%, their share rose to13.94% in the second round, while NDC came down from 88.64 to86.06%. What is open to speculation is the much higher turnout in thesecond round, namely 739,669 total votes as compared to 679,396 in theﬁrst round, amounting to an increase of 60,600 in the number of votescast. Some of the increase in speciﬁc constituencies would warrant closerinvestigation by the REC or EC.27Although Mills was of Fante origin, people in the Volta Region stillassociated the party with former president Rawlings, the NDC’s greyeminence who has a partly Ewe background. The reason given for why achange of government was necessary was that the power had to be takenaway from ‘those people inKumasi ’ who allegedly did not care aboutVoltaRegion – the fairly poor road conditions were often invoked as evidence.28An indicator of NPP’s view of its prospects in the second round, as seen bythe party’s ‘National Campaign Coordination’, was the failure of nationalparty oﬃcials to put in a showing during the pre-election period. Clearly,the region had been written oﬀ. It appears that the operative strategy wasto disturb the election procedures and – if the situation should permit – touse this in order to hinder the oﬃcial announcement of the ﬁnal presi-dential results, should these not be in favour of the NPP.Three days before voting took place, the government closed the borderwith Togo, on suspicion that a number of Ewe people from Togo hadregistered and would vote in the interest of their kinsmen. The furiousreaction by NDC oﬃcials showed that this distrust was not completelymisplaced.29 Signiﬁcantly, no other border was closed. Every time theNDC regional oﬃce was visited by the EU observers, the latter en-countered allegations about the rigging of the election by NPP (and viceversa). Sometimes, the claims were quite obscure. For example observerswere told that the houses of NDC sympathisers in Dambai had beenmarked by NPP youth, as in Rwanda, in order to deal with them after the110 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187election. However, when EU oﬃcials tried to verify the allegations on thespot, NDC oﬃcials were not able to provide any evidence. In Kete-Krachithe observers were told that many Muslim youth members who were re-garded as potential NDC voters had been imprisoned due to unrest inthe town. In reality however it proved to be an internal quarrel in theZongo Muslim Community between the Muslim youth and so-calledtraditionalists.In short, (perceived) ethnicity continued to be a major underlying factorin the 2008 election in the Volta Region. This clearly played a part in theblock voting. But it also underlined contrasting images of political virtue:whereas the Volta Region has been stereotyped within NPP circles as asuperstitious, almost barbarous place where it is practically impossible tosecure a fair deal, NDC activists in the region see themselves as thestrongest bulwark against Ashanti hegemonic pretensions. These dis-courses need to be taken seriously because, as the Kenyan example shows,an escalation of political tensions can lead to their operationalisation in asyet unrealised ways. The traditional structures and their role in the elec-tion have so far been left out of most analyses. As in other African societies,traditional authorities play a greater role than is generally taken intoconsideration by election observers.30 The question is whether and howfar other ethnic groups could become embroiled in ethnic cleavageswithin the framework of future elections. Whether the NDC and NPPwill honour the Code of Conduct for political parties as well as theformal legal precautions against instrumentalisation of ethnicity inpolitics in the next election remains to be seen. But there are someworrying signs.: : :Undoubtedly, Ghana’s process of democratisation is more advanced thanin many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Already in 2000, swingvoting was signiﬁcant enough to produce a change of government. Inaddition, it has become more diﬃcult for individuals and political partiesto cheat massively in Ghana’s elections, despite persistent voting irregu-larities and widespread abuse of incumbency. The EC has carved out a re-putation as an independent, fair and credible institution. Signiﬁcantly, theelite and large sections of the population were prepared to accept resultsdeclared by the EC when it mattered. Nevertheless, neglected or un-recognised electoral fraud and a history of impunity in already volatileconstituencies and regions of decisive importance for the general outcomeof the polls could encourage large-scale electoral fraud in future elections.TH E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 111http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.187This poses a threat and is a destabilising factor in Ghana’s democratisationprocess.The Achilles’ heel of election administration in Ghana has been thedubious voters’ register and the irresolute attitude of the EC and otherresponsible authorities when it came to checking improbably high voterturnouts and apparent electoral malpractice connected with block votingin several constituencies in Ashanti and the Volta Region. Surprisingly,neither of the main political parties insisted on rigorous in-depthinvestigation once their complaints were rebuﬀed by the EC. Could itbe that the instrumentalisation of ethnicity played a major part invote rigging, in view of the fact that ‘ethnic cleavages ’ constitute a deeplyengrained emic view of the rule of politics in Ghana, and that each ofthe concerned hoped to proﬁt from it eventually at the expense of theother?Certainly, diverse constitutional and other legal provisions mentionedabove prevented straightforward ‘ethnic voting’. However, in a societywhere informal institutions and ethnicity in politics and economy areparamount (Fallon 2004; Lentz & Nugent 2000; Meagher 2007; Nugent2001b; Tonah 2009), formal political rules operate under severe con-straints. An in-depth study of the 2004 election revealed that in most caseslocal inﬂuences dominated voters’ decisions, including primordial cleav-ages, regional political traditions, and the inﬂuence of traditional chiefs(Boafo-Arthur 2006: 365–6). A piecemeal but painstaking democratisationof the fabric of informal politics including chieftaincy (which seems to bedeeply involved in block voting), and a meaningful decentralisation policyfrom below (Crawford 2009), would be required to lay a sustainable basefor a functioning democracy at the grass-roots level, which could eventu-ally lead to a more responsive government. A precondition for downwardaccountability is to simultaneously empower local governments and citi-zens. Past experience shows that ‘decentralisation from above’ cannot dothe job. It prevents a genuine devolution of power, which would requireamong other things a realignment of the structures of traditional authorityin line with basic democratic requirements (Crawford 2008, 2009). Inshort, there is nothing which could replace political struggle for realdemocracy from below.N O T E S1. As expected, the contesting major parties and their candidates attained their best results withhighest voter turnout in their respective strongholds: Nana Akufo-Addo, leader of the NationalPatriotic Party (NPP) gained 75% of valid votes in Ashanti, and Atta Mills, presidential candidate ofNational Democratic Congress (NDC) got 86% in Volta Region, labelled as the ‘World Bank’ of theNDC by party veteran and former head of state Jerry Rawlings (see Figure 1).112 HE I N Z J OCKER S, D I R K KOHN ERT AND P AU L NUG ENThttp://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.1872. According to Gyimah-Boadi (2009: 143), ‘both parties shamelessly attempted to mobilize ethnicvotes, virtually declaring their respective strongholds – the Ashanti Region for the NPP and the VoltaRegion for the NDC – as ‘‘no-go’’ zones for their opponents’ during the run-oﬀ to the presidentialelection on 28.12.2008.3. Unfortunately, Lindberg & Morrison (2005: 577) could not test for ethnic bloc voting because oflack of time and reliable data.4. See EC-website: www.ec.gov.gh/node/63. As regards core and swing voters, the Central Region(8.2% of registered voters) was a notable example, because in 2008 the Fante-Akan majority of thepopulation abandoned the NPP for the NDC, apparently for non-ethnic reasons. The Central Regionvoted for the NDC in 1992, 1996 and 2008, but for the NPP in 2000 and 2004. There were ‘swings’against the NPP in Brong-Ahafo, and in its favour in parts of the North.5. The remarkable increase of the percentage of invalid votes in Ghanaian elections since 1992 ledsome scholars already to believe that these rejected ballots could act as a possible ‘ third force’, an evenmore decisive factor in tipping the scales than the smaller opposition parties (Gyimah-Boadi 2009:150). Invalid votes amounted to 205,438 or 2.4% in the ﬁrst round of the 2008 election, and 92,886 or1.0% in the second round. For reasons for the unusually high number of invalid votes in the ﬁrst roundsee Loetzer & Mo¨nikes 2009: 87.6. The following analysis is based on the experience of the authors as internationalelection observers during Ghana’s 2008 election with the EU and the Carter Center respectively,complemented by additional ﬁeld research and/or professional experience in Ghana during the pastdecade. Most of the quantitative data is based on ﬁgures provided by the Electoral Commission inAccra.7. We are grateful to an anonymous reader for drawing our attention to this, and for the obser-vation that one probable reason was the impossibility of reconciling the declared results and theaggregated polling station ﬁgures. In the Volta Region, Paul Nugent and Tom Molony came across anumber of examples where the reported polling station turnouts were over 100%. This also happenedon a signiﬁcant scale in Ashanti. It is clearly diﬃcult for the EC to draw attention to such anomalies,but this has implications for the credibility of the process.8. See the EC-website : www.ec.gov.gh/node/63, accessed 14.9.2009, for detailed 2004 presidentialresults for regions and constituencies.9. The negative example of the Kenyan 2007 elections (Harneit-Sievers & Peters 2008) may explainthe strong engagement of Ghanaian civic organisations that wanted to prevent similar atrocities intheir country.10. The Carter Center had only previously observed the 1992 elections. Its return in 2008 reﬂectedconcerns about how things were going in the registration phase.11. The international donor community was in dire need of a democratic model to be presented toAfrican peers with rather doubtful governance credentials. The World Bank had, for example, alreadyfacilitated a training mission in 2004 for the newly elected Liberian Parliament (before its inauguration)in Accra, in order to learn from the Ghanaian Parliament.12. Similar to the ‘diplomatic bias ’, the ‘ technocratic bias ’ is a potential characteristic of inter-national election observation which distorts the result for technical rather than diplomatic reasons.Increasing professionalism of election observation leads to a top-down approach on the part of theobservers, focusing on technical domains like the formal institutional framework of a democraticmultiparty system or sound sampling procedures. Last, but not least, due to lack of time and resourcesfor in-depth investigation, observers tend to disregard informal institutions and the indigenous socio-cultural setting, which are of the outmost importance in Ghana in particular and in West Africa ingeneral (Meagher 2007). This concerns for example ‘money politics ’, which reaches far beyond ‘votebuying’ or corruption in the political history of Ghana (Nugent 2001b: 407–10; Owusu 2006). Anotherexample is the question of land tenure and its instrumentalisation in politics, which will remain a bigand controversial problem in future. Recently discovered oil ﬁelds in the Ghanaian oﬀshore regionand the expectation of a big proﬁt added to the ﬁnancial prospects of the informal politics of elections.Considering the latter might result in quite a diﬀerent interpretation of the electoral process (for amore detailed exploration of the concepts see Kohnert 2004).13. See below for detailed turnout ﬁgures of the 2008 election. However, there is no direct corre-lation between the results of the speciﬁc conspicuous constituencies in the Ashanti and Volta Regionsin the 2008 elections, compared with the presidential polls in 1996, 2004 and 2000.14. See Smith 2002: 629–33 for a detailed discussion of diﬀerences in voter turnout in Ashanti andVolta in the 2000 elections.T H E GHANA E L E C T I ON O F 2008 113http://journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 19 Dec 2013 IP address: 129.215.19.18715. The turnout in the 2008 parliamentary election for the relevant constituencies in the Ashantiand Volta Regions diﬀered only marginally (less than 1%) from that for the ﬁrst round of the presi-dential election; see EC-website : www.ec.gov.gh/node/208, accessed 14.9.2009, and Tables 1 and 2.Party support and support for the presidential candidate of that party likewise diﬀered only marginally.This is no surprise, because voting was at the same time and place for both elections (parliamentaryand presidential ﬁrst round). Data on the parliamentary election are thus of limited, if any, value as anadditional cross-check on the presidential data for the second round.16. See ‘Voters register hits 12.8 million’, available at : www.ghana.gov.gh/node/5615/print,accessed 5.4.2009.17. It is unlikely that even the newly employed tactic of the NPP (and NDC) in its stronghold,vigorous house-to-house campaigns dubbed fre wo nua (literally, call your brother to go and vote), couldresult in such a massive increase in the total number of additional voters in the two weeks between theﬁrst and second rounds. Although the quoted turnout ﬁgures are highly incredible, they are hard tofalsify with robust facts and ﬁgures under the present conditions in Ghana or elsewhere in Africa.18. See the EC 2004 presidential election data-sheets at : www.ec.gov.gh/node/63, accessed29.4.2009.19. This comment is based on personal observation. Paul Nugent spent some time in the ElectoralCommissioner’s oﬃce on election day, and it was striking that a late release of results from Ashanti wasbeing anticipated as a contentious issue.20. Empirical analysis for this section is based on numerous narrative and focus group interviews, aswell as talks with key persons, selected by means of both the snowball and pre-informed structuredsampling method conducted by Heinz Jockers all over the Province. It included election and partyoﬃcials, civil servants, the Ulama and Christian representatives, traditional authorities like the chiefs,queen mothers and traditional healers, academics, and many other people during three months in thepre- and post-election period of December 2008.21. Daniel Smith (2002: 627–33) described this in detail for the 2000 election. It is all the moresurprising that during the 2008 election the EU observers hardly met any local observers at the pollingstations or at the tabulation centres of the region.22. The constituency is situated in a minority area in the northern part of the region where, althoughAkan is used as lingua franca, the diﬀerent groups are not related to the Akan. The Busia-Danquahtradition gained one seat in this part of the region in 1969, but otherwise failed to make any inroads.23. This allegation is based on a strategy paper by NPP giving hints how to manipulate elections.Only some of these appear to have been acted on.24. A court case was ﬁxed after the election.25. By law, an agent who refuses to sign has to give the reason in a written form. This did nothappen at any polling station.26. Paul Nugent and Tom Molony investigated NPP complaints of violence and intimidation insome Volta Region constituencies on behalf of the Carter Center, but no clear picture emerged. In onecase, where serious allegations were made by the District Chief Executive, they encountered partyexecutives from the NDC and NPP who were on extremely friendly terms. However, there were somepolling stations which returned turnouts of over 100%. The NEC regional oﬃcer was co-operative,but could not explain the anomalies.27. Ketu South 11,167 more votes cast, Anlo 4,792, Avenor 5,073, Tongu North 4,786, Ho Central4,495, and Ho East 4,954 are outstanding examples.28. See Nugent 2001a.29. There has always been suspicion about the link between the Ewe on each side of the Ghana–Togo border, including allegations of arms traﬃcking.30. All chiefs, queen mothers, herbalists and church authorities spoken to were convinced about aclear win for NDC in the Volta Region.
