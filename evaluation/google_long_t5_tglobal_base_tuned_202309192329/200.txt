IntroductionHealth behavior consists of a bundle of choices, such as whether toconsume alcohol, whether to smoke and whether to be physically activeor not. People do not make decisions on health behaviors independentlyof each other (e.g., Van Ours, 2004). However, it is not well understoodhow health behaviors interact and whether and how they are jointlylinked to long-term labor market outcomes.The use of addictive substances is distinct from normal consumerchoices. Smoking and, less so, alcohol use are addictive behaviors, andquitting either one – especially smoking – is difficult (National CancerInstitute, 2009). The initiation of smoking and alcohol use usually oc-curs in adolescence (Taioli and Wynder, 1991; Sartor et al., 2007),when the person is not mature enough to take long-term effects intoaccount in decisions. Physical inactivity tracks moderately from ado-lescence onwards (Waller et al., 2017). There are motivational factorsand societal barriers to maintaining an adequate level of physical ac-tivity (Aaltonen et al., 2014).There is an extensive body of literature on the relationships betweenspecific risky and protective health behaviors and labor market out-comes (Cawley and Ruhm, 2012). Smoking and heavy alcohol con-sumption are associated with weaker labor market attachment andlower earnings (French and Zarkin, 1995; MacDonald and Shields,2001; Van Ours, 2004; Böckerman et al., 2015, 2017; Korhonen et al.,2015). Furthermore, there is a negative relationship between physicalinactivity and subsequent labor market outcomes (Lechner, 2009;Hyytinen and Lahtonen, 2013). These negative correlations are con-sistent with risky health behavior and weak health eroding the capacity(e.g., owing to increased absence from work) and opportunities (e.g.,due to discrimination by employers, co-workers or consumers) to earnmarket income.A crucial limitation of the empirical literature is that the effect of aspecific health behavior has been analyzed in isolation, without con-sidering the potential joint associations of health behaviors with labormarket outcomes. An exception to this is Van Ours (2004), who ex-amined the wage effects of alcohol use and smoking using survey datafrom the Netherlands. For men, Van Ours (2004) found that the asso-ciation of wage with alcohol use was, a bit surprisingly, positive. Thewage effect of smoking was opposite and of approximately equal (ab-solute) size as that of alcohol use. While insightful, Van Ours (2004) didnot consider the (potential) joint relationships between alcohol use andsmoking. Heavy alcohol consumption may reinforce the negative as-sociation of smoking with labor market outcomes.This paper contributes to the literature by developing an empiricalhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.04.039Received 4 September 2017; Received in revised form 20 April 2018; Accepted 24 April 2018∗ Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: petri.bockerman@labour.fi (P.

All rights reserved.Tframework that treats risky health behaviors as a bundle and allows fora systematic examination of the joint associations (i.e., interactions) ofhealth behaviors. We adopt the econometric approach of Carree et al.(2011), which was originally introduced to examine the joint effects(i.e., complementarities) between different production inputs. Wemodify their approach so that it allows a direct examination of whether,e.g., heavy alcohol consumption and smoking reinforce each other'slinks to labor market outcomes. In so doing, we address the recent callof Cawley (2015), who stressed the need to understand the inter-connections among health behaviors.We examine the potential joint associations of health behaviors withlong-term labor market outcomes. We use nationally representative twindata that are linked to register-based information on long-term labormarket outcomes. The linked data have four major strengths. First, thedata allow us to construct measures for risky health behaviors(smoking, alcohol use, physical inactivity) that refer to the same pointsin time in the twins' early adulthood and that are predetermined re-lative to the outcome variables, measured later in life. Second, wemeasure individuals' smoking, alcohol use and physical inactivity overan extended period using two surveys, one conducted in 1975 and theother in 1981. Therefore, we are not forced to rely on cross-sectionalmeasures of risky health behaviors, which may provide incomplete ornoisy descriptions of what unhealthy lifestyle choices imply in the longterm. Third, the register-based administrative data allow us to measurethe average of an individual's annual earnings and employment over anextended 20-year period. Cross-sectional measures are poor proxies forindividuals' lifetime labor market outcomes (Böhlmark and Lindquist,2006). The use of register-based data also minimizes non-response andreporting biases that are typical in survey data. Fourth, the twin dataallow distinguishing between monozygotic (MZ, genetically identical)and dizygotic (DZ, genetically full siblings) twins. We can therefore toaccount for both shared environmental factors, such as family back-ground, neighborhood and shared peer effects, as well as for geneticfactors, which are potential confounders. The data also allow us tocontrol for a number of (predetermined) differences between the co-twins of twin pairs.The prior medical and epidemiological literature suggests a numberof reasons for why unhealthy behavioral patterns may cluster (i.e., whycertain health behaviors are related to other health behaviors; see, e.g.,Hale and Viner, 2016). For example, Rensburg et al. (2009) argue thatexercising affects implicit motivational processes and promotessmoking cessation. Papathanasiou et al. (2012) note that the directionof causality may run from smoking to physical inactivity through re-duced cardio-respiratory fitness. Using a twin design, Kujala et al.(2007) examine adolescent physical activity and later smoking beha-vior. Smoking later in life is more prevalent among those who wereinitially persistently inactive. Evidence on whether exercise supportssmoking cessation is inconclusive (Ussher et al., 2014). Using an ex-perimental design, Savette et al. (2005) showed that alcohol use in-creased both the magnitude and emotional valence of cigarette crav-ings. Smoking may also enhance pleasure and reward from alcoholconsumption (Lipperman-Kreda and Lee, 2011). Additionally, nicotinecan promote the consumption of alcohol, for example, through differentneurotransmitter expressions (Lajitha and Sershen, 2010). Finally, re-search based on twin data suggest that multiple risky health behaviorsare correlated (see, e.g., Sudharsanan et al., 2016, and the referencestherein). For example, True et al. (1999) and Han et al. (1999) foundthat genetic factors contribute to the risk for dual dependence of bothalcohol use and smoking (see also Madden and Heath, 2002). Furthersupport for shared genetic liability comes from molecular geneticanalyses of measured genetic variants across the genome; genetic cor-relations between smoking and alcohol use and abuse are high (Clarkeet al., 2017). Lia et al. (2016) showed that smoking is negatively as-sociated, and former drinking positively associated with BMI even whenshared genetic and environmental factors were accounted for.The clustering of smoking, heavy alcohol consumption and physicalinactivity at the individual level may lead to weaker labor market at-tachment (e.g., increased absence from work) and to limited job marketopportunities through numerous channels. While we cannot empiricallypin down the exact mechanisms at work, there are two primary reasonswhy the clustering of adverse health behaviors can be expected topredict poor labor market outcomes. First, the clustering of addictiveand irresponsible health behaviors may be related to a latent factormirroring myopic time preferences or delayed discounting (impatience)of individuals. Such preferences reduce a person's initial investments inhuman, social and health capital, making him/her less productive in thelabor market. Second, the clustering of risky health behaviors mayerode an individual's existing stocks of human, social and health ca-pital. For example, the smoking-drinking interaction erodes employ-ability and productivity at work: Heavy alcohol use leads to work ab-sence (Norström, 2006) and can alone be a cause of severe adversehealth conditions (e.g. due to accidents while drunk). When combinedwith smoking, alcohol use has a particularly negative effect on specifichealth measures (Antunes et al., 2013). For example, joint consumptionof alcohol and cigarettes increases the risk of cancer and cardiovasculardiseases and eventually mortality (e.g., Wang-Hong et al., 2007). Si-milarly, being a smoker who is physically inactive or being a heavydrinker who is physically inactive may, in the long-term, lead to re-duced physical capacity and erode cognitive and non-cognitive skills,which are the fundamental determinants of earnings and employmentcapacity (Heckman et al., 2006).2. Methods2.1. Data sources and the sampleWe use the Older Finnish Twin Cohort Study of the Department ofPublic Health at the University of Helsinki. As in prior work (Hyytinenand Lahtonen, 2013; Böckerman et al., 2015, 2017), the twin data havebeen linked to the Finnish Longitudinal Employer-Employee Data(FLEED) of Statistics Finland (SF) using personal identifiers. The recordlinkages of linked data comply the Data Protection Act and have beenapproved by the ethical committee of the Department of Public Health,University of Helsinki and SF.The Finnish Cohort Study was originally compiled from the CentralPopulation Registry of Finland (Kaprio et al., 1979; Kaprio andKoskenvuo, 2002). Initial twin candidates were persons born before1958 with the same birth date, commune of birth, sex, and surname atbirth. A questionnaire was mailed to the candidates in 1975 to gatherbaseline data and to determine their zygosity. Two follow-up surveyswere conducted in 1981 and 1990. The 1990 survey was sent only tothose twins who were born after 1930. These twins were at least 33years old in 1990. Therefore, we focus on the working-age population.FLEED is an annual panel over the years 1990–2009 that covers theworking-age population of Finland (see, e.g., Hyytinen and Lahtonen,2013; Böckerman et al., 2015, 2017). FLEED contains information,obtained from tax and other administrative registers, on individuals'labor market status, and salaries and other relevant sources of income.The analysis focuses on twin pairs for whom we observe informationon health behaviors in 1975 and 1981 and earnings and employmentstatus from 1990 to 2009. Excluding those men and women who retiredbefore 2009, the estimation sample includes 4654 twin pairs, i.e., 9308individuals. The individuals were, on average 27, years old in 1975, 33years old in 1981 and 42 years old at the time we start measuring theirlabor market outcomes in 1990.2.2. MeasuresWe use two outcome variables that capture poor labor marketoutcomes in the long run. The first outcome variable measures an in-dividual's lifetime earnings (= wage + salary earnings + self-em-ployment income). It is calculated as the gender-specific reverse rankP. Böckerman et al. Social Science & Medicine 207 (2018) 55–6356order (100-1) of average lifetime earnings over the observation window1990–2009. The variable is calculated using the percentiles of the dis-tribution of lifetime earnings in our sample and describes how well anindividual fares relative to other individuals in terms of his/her long-term earnings capacity. The second outcome variable measures an in-dividual's long-term tendency to be frequently unemployed (i.e. his/herlabor market attachment). It is calculated as the average number ofunemployment months per year over the period 1990–2009.We measure risky health behaviors by heavy alcohol consumption,smoking and physical inactivity. These behaviors have drawn con-siderable attention in the empirical literature in health economics (andrelated fields), but their labor market implications have rarely beenexplored in the same analysis (see Cawley and Ruhm, 2012). Heavyalcohol consumption and smoking are also the major contributors todifferences in life-expectancy in both developed and developing coun-tries (see Steel, 2017), and for example account for about one-half ofthe SES differences in mortality in Finland (Martikainen et al., 2014).They are also modifiable risk factors (no one needs to smoke or usealcohol), and physical activity levels can be increased also by societalaction. For ease of interpretation, the variables for risky health beha-viors are defined such that they reflect risky or undesirable health be-havior.To capture long-term risky health behaviors, the measures are basedon self-reported information from the 1975 and 1981 twin surveys. Wemeasure heavy alcohol consumption by a persistent tendency to be abinge drinker. Binge drinking is associated with negative health con-sequences, such as increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events(stroke and myocardial infarction). It is a better measure of pattern ofdrinking than quantity alone (Sipilä et al., 2016; Rehm et al., 2017).Our measure is equal to one for those who in both 1975 and 1981 re-ported consuming at least once a month on the same occasion anamount of alcohol that corresponds to at least one bottle of wine. Tocapture persistent smoking, we use a binary indicator for currentsmoking status in 1975 and 1981 (i.e., whether the person reportedsmoking at the time of both surveys). To measure physical inactivity,we use the MET index (Metabolic Equivalent Tasks). For persons whoare considered physically inactive, the mean MET index is∼1–2. This isroughly equivalent to the energy expenditure of sitting and of minorhome activities (Ainsworth et al., 2000). We followed the World HealthOrganization (2010) and used an MET index threshold of being lessthan 1.5 both in 1975 and 1981 as a measure for persistent physicalinactivity.We use the binary indicators to define risky health behaviors, be-cause the binary indicators (as opposed to continuous measures) allowus to explore the clustering of risky health behavior in a transparentway. Every individual is assigned to a single category so that the ca-tegories are mutually exclusive. If, in 1975 and 1981, a person only hada history of consuming alcohol heavily, we set H=1 (and set H=0otherwise); if he/she had only smoked, we set S= 1 (and set S= 0otherwise); and if he/she was only physically inactive, we set P= 1(and set P= 0 otherwise). Those who had heavy alcohol consumptionand who smoked in 1975 and 1981 but who were not physically in-active are assigned to a category denoted as HS. The other categories,HP and SP, are defined similarly. Finally, we set HSP equal to one forthose persons who had heavy alcohol consumption, who smoked andwho were physically inactive in 1975 and 1981. An individual cannotbelong to more than one category from set {H, S, P, HS, HP, SP, HSP},implying that the reference group consists of those who have no riskyhealth behaviors.We consider the robustness of the estimation results using differentrisky behavior measures for heavy drinkers, smokers and physicallyinactive persons. The description of these additional results is providedin the Online Supplementary Appendix.2.3. Econometric approachInspired by Carree et al. (2011), we postulate the followingeconometric specification for the (poor) long-term labor market out-comes:Yij = αHHij+αSSij+αHPij+αHSHSij+αHPHPij+αSPSPij+αHSPHSPij+Xi-j'β + fj + gj + εij (1)where Yij is one of the measures for poor labor market outcomes forindividual i from family (twinpair) j, binary indicators {H, S, P, HS, HP,SP, HSP} are mutually exclusive groups of health behaviors, Xij is avector of control variables, fj is an unobserved shared family effect, gj isan unobserved shared genetic effect and εij is an i.i.d. error term.To see how the model works, consider heavy drinking and smoking:There is evidence for an adverse interaction effect between them if thehypothesis αH + αS= αHS is rejected (i.e., if sum αH + αS is smallerthan αHS). Similar reasoning applies to heavy drinkers and physicallyinactive (αH + αP≠ αHP) and to smokers and physically inactive(αS + αP≠ αSP).We estimate model (1) in three ways. First, we treat the data asindividuals (i.e., assume fj ≡ 0 and gj ≡ 0) and estimate the modelparameters by ordinary least squares (OLS), using the sample that in-cludes both MZ and DZ twins. Second, we take twin differences to re-move fj and run the regression using the same combined sample. Third,we further run the regression using the MZ sample only to remove bothfj and gj. In the within-MZ model, all factors that the two twins share(e.g., shared environmental factors, shared genes, business cycle effects,cohort effects) are eliminated.We include in Xij an individual's age and a rich vector of controlvariables to account for potential confounders and within-twin pairheterogeneity. All control variables are taken from the 1975 twinsurvey and are thus predetermined. First, we account for heterogeneityin pre-existing health conditions that may be correlated with riskyhealth behavior and labor market outcomes. To this end, we includemeasures for height, BMI, the number of chronic diseases, and reducedemployability due to injuries (= 1 if a person had injuries causing weakemployability). We also control for the possibility that individuals arephysically inactive off work because they have a (presumably low-paid)physically demanding job (= 1 if work is physically demanding).Second, there may be unobserved psychological and psychopatholo-gical characteristics that affect both risky health behavior and labormarket outcomes, such as mental stability. Mental stability is measuredusing the indicators of neuroticism and extraversion that originate fromthe 1975 survey. Neuroticism (extraversion) was assessed by 10 (9)items in the short form of the Eysenck Personality Inventory. We alsoadd the use of tranquilizers as a covariate (= 1 if the twin reports usinga positive quantity of tranquilizers in 1975) to capture an aspect ofmental ill-health. Finally, to account for potential reverse causality, weadd controls for predetermined employment status and prior earningsfrom the 1975 survey. These variables address the concern that alcoholconsumption, physical inactivity, or smoking may be the consequenceof a poor labour market position early in life.Regression model (1) includes a number of interaction terms be-tween the variables that describe specific health behaviors. We firstlook at men and women separately. This analysis reveals that certaincombinations of risky health behaviors are rare. To ensure that we haveenough variation in the analysis sample (and thus to preserve statisticalpower), we confirm the results using pooled data consisting of both menand women.3. Descriptive statistics3.1. Mean values of risky health behaviorsTable 1 reports the mean values of the mutually exclusive indicatorsP. Böckerman et al. Social Science & Medicine 207 (2018) 55–6357of risky health behaviors by gender (not age-adjusted). Four key find-ings stand out. First, a large fraction of men (39%) and women (57%)are not persistently heavy users of alcohol, smokers or physically in-active. The gender difference is large in magnitude and statisticallysignificant. Second, women are more likely just to smoke (S) or to bephysically inactive (P) than men, whereas men are more likely just to beheavy drinkers (H). Third, men are more likely to have multiple types ofrisky health behaviors. Notably, men are from four to six times morelikely than women to have heavy alcohol consumption and be smokers(HS), to have heavy alcohol consumption and be physically inactive(HP) and to be heavy drinkers, smoker and physically inactive (HSP).Fourth, certain combinations of risky health behaviors are rare. Inparticular, only 1–2% of women both drink and smoke (HS), drink andare physically inactive (HP), or have all three risky behaviors (HSP).3.2. Association of risky health behaviors with labor market outcomesWe analyze the mean values of the measures of the labor marketoutcomes by different categories of risky health behaviors and genderin Figs. 1–2. The vertical lines of each bar display the 95% confidenceintervals for the means. Figs. 1–2 reveal two important patterns. First,those who are heavy drinkers, smokers and are physically inactive havemuch lower lifetime earnings and much more unemployment months inthe long run, especially when they are compared to those who have noundesirable health behavior. Second, the lifetime earnings are alsonotably low and the number of unemployment months is high whensmoking is combined with heavy alcohol use (HS), especially for men.4. Main estimation resultsThe OLS and within-sibling estimates of equation (1) are reported inTable 2 (men) and Table 3 (women). The outcome variables are long-term earnings and unemployment. All models include {H, S, P, HS, HP,SP, HSP} as regressors, implying that the baseline comparison categoryrefers to those who have no risky health behaviors. The rows in thelower part of the tables report tests for the model coefficients. The rowslabelled as T4, T7 and T10 report the relevant tests for the interactioneffects between our three risky health behavior measures.The OLS estimates tend be more often statistically significant thanthe estimates of the within DZ-MZ and within-MZ regressions. The re-sults based on twin design therefore suggest that it is important tocontrol for unobserved family and genetic factors in estimating the jointassociations of health behaviors with long-term labor market outcomes.In what follows, we focus only on those estimates that are statisticallysignificant in the within DZ-MZ and, especially, within-MZ regressions.Using these criteria, four important findings stand out.First, smoking per se is related to weaker earnings and employment(cf. Böckerman et al., 2015) when unobserved family factors are con-trolled for. The estimates become mostly statistically insignificant whenalso genetic factors are accounted for in the models. Second, earningsand employment are much lower for those men who have engaged insmoking and heavy alcohol use (HS) than for those who do not reportany risky health behaviors. Third, consistent with Figs. 1–2, those menand women who were heavy drinkers, smoked and were physicallyinactive in 1975/1981 (HSP) are more likely to have low lifetimeearnings and experience more unemployment months than those whodo not report any risky health behaviors.Fourth, and most importantly, the F-tests in the lower parts of theTable 1Description of raw data: Measures of risky health behavior by gender.Men Women Difference p-value% oftotalN % oftotalNHeavy alcohol use (H) 0.13 533 0.02 82 0.11 <0.01Smoking (S) 0.08 359 0.10 519 −0.02 <0.01Physical inactivity (P) 0.15 634 0.22 1117 −0.07 <0.01Heavy alcohol use andsmoking (HS)0.10 435 0.02 91 0.08 <0.01Heavy alcohol use andphysically inactive(HP)0.04 192 0.01 28 0.03 <0.01Smoking and physicallyinactive (SP)0.05 218 0.05 253 0.00 0.99All three (HSP) 0.06 244 0.01 47 0.05 <0.01None of the above: Norisky healthbehavior0.39 1697 0.57 2859 −0.18 <0.01Total N 1.00 4312 1.00 4996Notes: Mutually exclusive categories.

Böckerman et al. Social Science & Medicine 207 (2018) 55–6359tables reveal that there is a joint effect between smoking and heavyalcohol use for men when the reverse rank order of lifetime earningsand unemployment months are used as the outcome. In these cases, thenull hypotheses αH + αS= αHS are rejected, especially in the MZ re-gression. For women, there is no evidence for the joint effects.A problem with the above gender-specific analysis is that certaincombinations of health behaviors are rare, especially among women.This data limitation may lead to noisy estimates. To tackle the problem,we estimated model (1) in the twin-differenced form after pooling menand women together. This pooling results in larger estimating samples.The results are presented in Columns 1 and 3 (within DZ and MZ re-gression) and Columns 2 and 4 (within MZ regression) of Table 4. AsColumns 2 and 4 show, we find evidence for the joint effects of smokingand heavy drinking when both shared environment and genetic factorsare fully accounted for; for both the outcome measures the null hy-pothesis αH + αS= αHS is rejected (i.e. the tests T4 in the lower part ofTable 4).5. Robustness checks and auxiliary evidence5.1. Alternative outcome variablesWe have re-run the within DZ-MZ and within MZ estimations for acombined sample of men and women reported in Table 4 using twoalternative outcome variables. Both variables were chosen to reflect anindividual's (potentially poor) long-term labor market position. First,we used the logarithm of average social income transfers over theperiod 1990–2009 as an outcome variable. Second, we used an in-dicator of being out of the labor force as an outcome variable. It wascalculated as the average share of years that the individual was out ofthe labor force over the period 1990–2009, excluding retired persons,students and those who are in military service. The results are reportedin Table A1 of Online Supplementary Appendix. Consistent with ourearlier results in Table 4, the within MZ estimations show that there isevidence for the joint effect between smoking and heavy use of alcohol,as the null hypothesis αH + αS= αHS is rejected when social incometransfers are used as the outcome variable.Our findings suggest that those who heavily consume alcohol andare smokers and that those who are heavy drinkers, smokers and phy-sically inactive are less successful in life. To check whether this patternholds more broadly, we report further descriptive evidence in Table A2of Online Supplementary Appendix. The table displays education years,marital status, whether a person has children and whether a person is ahomeowner by risky health behavior and gender (not age-adjusted), asmeasured in 1990. We regard these variables as descriptive indicatorsof better socio-economic outcomes. The table shows that those menwho report being smokers and heavy drinkers and those men who re-port all three risk factors are typically less educated, less likely married,less likely to have children and less likely homeowners than those whoreport none. The same findings largely apply to women. This auxiliaryevidence supports the view conveyed by our baseline analysis that thesetwo bundles of risky health behaviors {HS, HSP} are associated withTable 3Regression results: OLS and within DZ-MZ estimates for women.Reverse rank order of earnings Unemployment months(1)OLS(2)DZ-MZ(3)MZ(4)OLS(5)DZ-MZ(6)MZDirect termsH 5.76*(3.02)5.84(4.26)5.05(8.07)0.58**(0.26)0.68*(0.35)−0.01(0.61)S 5.16***(1.36)3.34**(1.70)5.07*(2.74)0.41***(0.10)0.25*(0.14)0.35(0.23)P 5.37***(0.99)3.80***(1.24)4.03**(1.92)0.11(0.07)0.11(0.09)0.20(0.16)Two-way interactionsHS 7.91***(3.01)7.91**(3.81)4.37(6.64)0.95***(0.32)0.81***(0.35)0.77(0.69)HP 6.09(5.64)4.27(7.48)9.88(8.59)1.02*(0.55)0.32(0.77)0.17(0.96)SP 9.84***(1.79)7.46***(2.29)4.71(4.50)0.64***(0.15)0.39**(0.20)−0.06(0.30)Three-way interactionHSP 11.67***(3.90)22.64***(5.13)15.34**(7.72)1.17**(0.46)1.70***(0.49)1.96**(0.89)Controls YES YES YES YES YES YESR2 0.14 0.05 0.05 0.04 0.02 0.04N 4996 2498 880 4996 2498 880Tests (F-test) p-value p-value p-value p-value p-value p-valueT1: αH= αS= αP=0 <0.01 < 0.01 < 0.10 <0.01 <0.10 0.32T2: αH= αHS 0.59 0.70 0.94 0.36 0.77 0.35T3: αS= αHS 0.39 0.25 0.92 <0.10 0.13 0.57T4: αH+αS= αHS 0.47 0.82 0.55 0.91 0.81 0.63T5: αH= αHP 0.96 0.85 0.63 0.48 0.66 0.87T6: αP= αHP 0.64 0.95 0.50 0.11 0.78 0.97T7: αH+αP= αHP 0.90 0.52 0.94 0.59 0.57 0.98T8: αS= αSP <0.05 <0.10 0.94 0.18 0.53 0.21T9: αP= αSP <0.05 0.14 0.88 <0.01 0.18 0.42T10: αS+αP= αSP 0.76 0.91 0.38 0.53 0.90 < 0.10T11:αH+αS+αP= αHSP 0.38 0.16 0.92 0.90 <0.10 0.22Notes: *** (p < 0.01), ** (p < 0.05), * (p < 0.10).

Böckerman et al. Social Science & Medicine 207 (2018) 55–6360particularly poor long-term outcomes. Therefore, the clustering of riskyhealth behaviors is empirically related to a low level of human andsocial capital.5.2. Alternative measures for risky behaviorsIdentifying what amounts to risky health behavior and measuring itappropriately are notoriously difficult empirical tasks. We have there-fore evaluated the robustness of the within DZ-MZ and within MZ es-timation results of Table 4 using alternative measures for risky healthbehavior.First, we used gender-specific thresholds for heavy alcohol use in-stead of the indicator for binge drinking. This extension is important,because all self-reported measures of alcohol consumption potentiallycontain some amount of measurement error. The twin surveys reportalcohol use in grams per day, which has been converted into grams perweek. We followed Dawson (2011) and used cut-off points that are 165grams per week for men (14 units of alcohol) and 110 grams per weekfor women (9 units of alcohol). There are no official global limits forheavy alcohol use, and the thresholds used by the public health au-thorities vary considerably from one country to another and within asingle country (Dawson, 2011; Shield et al., 2017). We created an in-dicator variable that obtains the value of one if a person consumedmore than the gender-specific cut-off amount of alcohol per week bothin 1975 and 1981.Second, we used a more restrictive indicator for smoking. Thecurrent smoking status is based on the subjective view of one's smokingbehavior. Many light smokers could report themselves as smokers.Another measure for smoking captures the lifetime consumption of ci-garettes: cigarette pack years= average number of cigarettes smokedper day× years of smoking. The measure was constructed from ques-tions about the use of tobacco products and frequency and the durationof smoking. For example, a person has only a 0.05 pack year history ofsmoking if (s)he has smoked one cigarette daily for one year. We usedan indicator that is equal to one for those who were current smokersand ever smokers, defined as the persons who reported being currentsmokers in 1975 and 1981 and who had strictly positive pack-yearsboth in 1975 and 1981.Third, we used an alternative measure of leisure time physical ac-tivity. The measure was constructed from questions about the monthlyfrequency, average duration and average intensity of a person's physicalactivity sessions. Using information on person's physical activity andactivity level during the journey to and from work, leisure time physicalactivity was classified into categories: sedentary exercisers, occasionalexercisers and conditioning exercisers (Kujala et al., 1998, p. 441;Hyytinen and Lahtonen, 2013). We use an indicator that is equal to onefor those who are physically inactive, defined as those persons whoreported not taking part in physical leisure activity (sedentary ex-ercisers) in both 1975 and 1981.Tables A3-A5 of Online Supplementary Appendix report the ro-bustness checks from the within DZ-MZ and within MZ samples thatpool men and women together. Importantly, there is evidence for thejoint effects between heavy alcohol use and smoking, as the null hy-pothesis αH + αS= αHS is rejected in most specifications, especiallywhen both shared environmental and genetic factor are accounted for.Finally, compared to those who do not have any risky health behaviors,individuals who smoke, drink heavily and are sedentary are more likelyto have lower long-term earnings and experience more unemployment.6. ConclusionsHealth is a durable good that is determined by genetic predisposi-tion to have good health and by complex health behaviors. Earlier re-search has examined the (causal) effects of specific risky health beha-viors on labor market outcomes, such as earnings and (un)employment.This literature suggests that alcohol consumption, smoking and physicalinactivity all lead per se to poor labor market outcomes. Our most im-portant contribution is that we evaluated risky health behavior as abundle and examined how (longer-term) measures of risky health be-haviors are associated with long-term labor market outcomes (earningsand unemployment).The key finding is that there is a degree of adverse complementaritybetween alcohol consumption and smoking, leading to worse long-termlabor market outcomes. We also find evidence that those who smoke,drink heavily and are physically inactive experience much poorer long-term labor market outcomes than those individuals who are neithersmokers, drinkers nor physically inactive.Our findings are policy-relevant for two reasons. First, there is adebate over the extent to which health behavior is driven by rationaldecision-making (Becker and Murphy, 1988; Cawley and Ruhm, 2012).The case for rational health behaviors weakens if there are significantor complicated joint associations, because it is cognitively cumbersomefor an individual to comprehend and correctly predict the importanceof such effects, especially when young or for a long period of time. Theaddictive nature of smoking in particular and heavy and regulardrinking may shape preferences, erode willpower, and/or underminecognitive capacity needed for rational, forward-looking decision-Table 4Regression results: Within DZ-MZ and within MZ estimates for the pooledsample of men and women.Reverse rank order ofincomeUnemployment monthsColumn(1)WithinDZ-MZColumn (2)Within MZColumn(3)WithinDZ-MZColumn (4)Within MZDirect termsH 3.15*(1.61)−0.24(2.99)0.36***(0.13)−0.29(0.25)S 3.78***(1.32)4.53**(2.21)0.37***(0.11)0.26(0.19)P 2.30**(0.95)3.71**(1.47)0.07(0.07)0.21*(0.12)Two-way interactionsHS 11.97***(1.84)11.19***(3.08)0.89***(0.18)0.83***(0.30)HP 3.84(2.58)3.20(5.20)0.43*(0.24)−0.21(0.51)SP 6.64***(1.66)8.32***(2.93)0.33**(0.14)0.13(0.21)Three-way interactionHSP 11.50***(2.28)12.14***(3.81)1.22***(0.21)1.09***(0.38)Controls YES YES YES YESR2 0.05 0.05 0.03 0.03N 4654 1564 4654 1564Tests (F-test) p-value p-value p-value p-valueT1: αH= αS= αP=0 <0.01 < 0.05 < 0.01 < 0.10T2: αH= αHS <0.01 <0.01 < 0.01 < 0.01T3: αS= αHS <0.01 <0.05 < 0.05 0.11T4: αH+αS= αHS <0.05 <0.10 0.49 < 0.05T5: αH= αHP 0.81 0.55 0.76 0.89T6: αP= αHP 0.56 0.92 0.14 0.39T7: αH+αP= αHP 0.58 0.96 0.99 0.81T8: αS= αSP 0.11 0.24 0.81 0.58T9: αP= αSP <0.05 0.13 < 0.10 0.70T10: αS+αP= αSP 0.78 0.98 0.51 0.19T11:αH+αS+αP= αHSP <0.01 0.43 0.27 0.11Note: OLS estimates using twin-differenced data, using the MZ twins only. ***(p < 0.01), ** (p < 0.05) and * (p < 0.10).

Böckerman et al. Social Science & Medicine 207 (2018) 55–6361making. Second, the trends in the health behavior indicators havevaried during the past few decades and across countries. For example,countries are at different stages of the tobacco epidemic (Lopez et al.,1994; Reitsma et al., 2017). Obesity and physical inactivity at work andduring commuting have become much more common in all in-dustrialized countries. There has been a controversy over whether thelong-term trends of smoking and obesity are related (Gruber andFrakes, 2006). Better awareness of the interconnections between healthbehaviors is needed to understand what mechanisms these trends re-flect and how they affect labor markets.Our approach has important limitations. First, even though by usingthe twin design, the estimated relationships are purged from sharedfamily and environmental effects, we cannot claim that the estimatedrelationships are causal. Additionally, we cannot rule out that there aresome other unaccounted (latent) person-specific attributes that have animpact on both risky health behavior and the long-term outcomes. Forexample, there may be relevant psychological and psychopathologicaldifferences between twins that have an impact on the estimates. Weaccounted for these psychological differences by controlling for within-twin pair differences using the measures of mental well-being in theregression model. Second, we estimated the empirical specifications inthe Finnish setting. Because the prevalence and development over timeof specific risky health behavior bundles is not identical in all in-dustrialized countries, the potential joint effects on labor market out-comes may also differ across countries. However, our econometric ap-proach can easily be applied to the data available for other countries inorder to broaden the policy discussions about the consequences of riskyhealth behaviors.Declaration of interestsNone.AcknowledgmentsThis research has been supported by the Jenny and Antti WihuriFoundation.
