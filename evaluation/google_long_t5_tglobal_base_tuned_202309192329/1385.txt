ABSTRACT: 
This paper examines the changing methods, underlying motives, clienteles and controversy surrounding posthumous commemorations of Lord Lister in Britain. The importance of the commemorations for professional identity formation continues throughout the twentieth century, but World War I appears as a turning point. The constituencies commemorating Lister change from broadly international, national and civic with an emphasis on fundraising, to more narrowly professional; the use of religious imagery is notable after the war in the debates in the 1920s; and as his students, so central to the creation and preservation of his image, die, the focus begins to shift from the man and his achievements, ‘the great benefactor of mankind’, to his legacy in the current state of subjects related to his work. The changing nature of the commemorations suggests that although Lister's precise position in the history of surgery is contentious today, his importance as an iconic figure in the history of the medical profession is secure.

These studieshighlight, for example, the French tradition of celebrating scientists, such as Pasteur, after1870 as republican substitutes for royalty and saints, and point to the importance ofnationalism in the interwar years with celebrations, in 1925, of the centenary of Charcot’sbirth in attempting to revive the international standing of France after the war. Yet, apartfrom Patricia Fara’s chapter on commemorations of Newton, British commemorations inthis collection are noticeable by their absence. However, since then commemoration hasbeen the subject of three presidential addresses to the British Society for the History ofScience and a paper comparing commemorations in 1919 surrounding the centenary ofuerite.dupree@glasgow.ac.uk261 q 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.M. W. Dupree262 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from James Watt’s death and in 1931 for the centenary of Michael Faraday’s ‘discovery’ ofelectromagnetism.3The aim of this paper is to contribute to an understanding of how these events came aboutand changed their nature and purposes, by focusing on the posthumous commemorationsassociated with Joseph Lister at different times during the twentieth century. It will bothexamine public events and take advantage of unpublished sources to go behind them toexplore how the activities were organized and to understand the intentions, motivationsand relationships of the individuals, institutions, groups and networks involved, and thushow they relate to the broader social, economic, political and cultural contexts in whichthey took place.Despite controversy in the 1860s and 1870s surrounding his antiseptic system, Lister wascelebrated in his lifetime: created a baronet in 1881, in 1897 he became the first Britishsurgeon to be raised to the peerage and in 1902 one of the 12 original members of thenewly founded Order of Merit. After his death, a full page in his funeral programme wasinsufficient to list the honours and awards from Britain and abroad that had beenconferred on him.As Anne Crowther’s paper in this collection suggests,4 Lister’s reputation and public imageby the end of his life was a complex construct, involving both the scientific and moralreputations of the medical profession, the rise of surgery from a craft to a science and therise of the profession as a whole to a pinnacle of esteem. This image originated in his largeScottish classes, in his experimental approach to surgical practice, in the simplicity andapplicability of what students learned from him in lectures, in the moral example heconveyed, and above all in the immense confidence in the future of surgery that he instilled.Although they were not alone, his students, both in London and Scotland, had an importantrole as creators and guardians of his image and reputation, culminating in his survivingstudents’ contributions to the 1927 centenary celebrations of his birth.5What is less well known is the controversy alongside the commemorations organized inBritain after his death, and the ways in which the commemorations changed in the second halfof the twentieth century. What follows will explore the nature of the main commemorations inBritain. Who organized them? What were their aims? What challenges did they face? Whichmethods did they use? How successful were they in meeting their aims? In what ways did theychange over the century?The Lister Memorial Committees, established in London and Glasgow in the wake of hisdeath in February 1912, had local, national and international aspirations and facedorganizational and practical challenges.6 The London Committee, although its constituencydwindled after World War I, largely met its objectives and provided the organizationalstarting point and some of the leadership for the 1927 celebrations of Lister’s birth. Yet theconstituencies and forms of commemoration in 1927 differed significantly from thoseplanned after his death and from those that followed later in the twentieth century, in 1965(the centenary of his first successful antiseptic operation) and 1967 (the centenary of hispublications in The Lancet and British Medical Journal). The Glasgow Committee becameimmersed in the controversy that was to end in the demolition of the Lister Ward at theGlasgow Royal Infirmary in 1924, rather than in its preservation as a museum, as petitionsfrom the major scientific and medical institutions had urged, and in Henry Wellcome’ssubsequent purchase of its constituent parts. The changing constituencies and forms ofcommemoration and the controversy reflect the contemporary context and raise issuesrelevant to commemoration today.From mourning to scientific legacy 263 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from FIRST COMMEMORATIONS: 1912–24Lister Memorial CommitteesLister’s funeral, held in Westminster Abbey on 16 February 1912, was attended by the PrimeMinister, ambassadors, representatives of royalty and the scientific and medical elite fromaround the world, as well as more humble practitioners and nurses. The attendance underlinedhis international stature. A ‘beautiful wreath of orchids and lilies sent by the GermanEmperor’ was ‘carried before the coffin as the procession entered the Abbey’.7 The music, thelack of an address, and three of the pallbearers ‘stirring the procession to unwonted colour bythe brightness of the gowns they wore’ were identical to features of the funeral of Lord Kelvinin the Abbey five years previously, and The Times described the ceremony as ‘one of the mostimpressive ever held in the Abbey; one in which every one present was a sincere mourner’.8In the wake of his death, Lister Memorial Committees were established, first in Glasgowand then in London. They faced organizational and practical problems. A group in Glasgowacted quickly: within 10 days of the funeral, the Lord Provost called a meeting thatunanimously resolved that Glasgow should commemorate the achievement of the greatpioneer of modern medicine whose discoveries had done ‘so much for the alleviation ofhuman suffering’.9 Two weeks later ‘a representative meeting of the citizens of Glasgow’proposed that the memorial should be both local and international.10 Given Lister’sconnections with the Royal Infirmary, they proposed ‘a monument of artistic design in theneighbourhood’ of the Infirmary, and three more ambitious proposals with an‘international character’, including the establishment of a Lister Award for contributionsto surgery ‘in any part of the world’, a Lister Research Fund for promoting fellowshipsand studentships, and the conversion of the Lister Ward in the Royal Infirmary into amuseum.11 They faced the question of how to organize a commemoration that had localand international dimensions, involving a range of institutions.In London, Fellows of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Surgeons of Englanddiscussed the question of a memorial to Lister immediately after his death, but they wereslow off the mark in comparison with Glasgow, and it was not until May that aProvisional Committee, consisting of seven representatives of the Royal Society, theRoyal College of Surgeons of England and the Royal Society of Medicine, includingRickman Godlee, Lister’s nephew and President of the Royal College of Surgeons ofEngland, and William Watson Cheyne, met under the chairmanship of the President ofthe Royal Society, with Sir John Rose Bradford of the Royal Society acting as secretary.12The Provisional Committee realized that no single institution had the prestige andstructure for decision-making that could coordinate the wide range of individuals andinstitutions interested in Lister’s commemoration, produce agreement on a suitablememorial and organize the collection of subscriptions. So, instead, it took steps to createa new entity, the Lister Memorial Committee, made up of a large General Committee,which would appoint a smaller Executive Committee to prepare, raise funds for and carryout a scheme. To maximize support and resources it invited the widest possible range ofprominent institutions and individuals to form the General Committee, includingapproximately 80 institutions, and a vast array of individuals, ‘not only men distinguishedin science and surgery, but also men of eminence in public life and in various branchesof knowledge’, including Ambassadors and Ministers to the English Court, HighCommissioners and Crown Agents, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Prime Minister, theMaster of the Rolls, the Speaker, the Viceroy of India, the Lord Provosts of EdinburghM.

Dupree264 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from and Glasgow and the Lord Mayor, HRH Prince Arthur of Connaught and HRH Prince Louisof Battenberg.13At its initial meetings in May, the Provisional Committee in London also had to work outits relationship with the existing Lister Memorial Committee in Glasgow. This highlightsthe utility of the General Committee structure envisaged in London. The GlasgowCommittee would be well represented on the General and Executive Committees inLondon, and conceded that any international memorial would be initiated in London, andthe form of commemoration would be decided by these committees, whose first meetingwould be in July.In addition, a Glasgow delegation and the London Committee discussed the knottyquestion of raising subscriptions for local purposes in Glasgow and agreed that appealscould be made in Glasgow for subscriptions to be devoted to either a local or aninternational memorial, or both.14The large number of invitations sent out by the Provisional Committee in London resulted inthe attendance of 37 people at the initial meeting of the General Committee in July 1912 in therooms of the Royal Society in Burlington House.15 The meeting approved the appointments ofWatson Cheyne as treasurer, Sir John Rose Bradford as secretary, and 27 members of theExecutive Committee, which still included prominent figures such as the Archbishop ofCanterbury, the Lord Chancellor, Master of the Rolls, Viscount Iveagh, the Lord Provosts ofEdinburgh and Glasgow, and the Lord Mayor of London, as well as the leaders of medicalinstitutions, for example the presidents of the General Medical Council, the Royal Collegeof Surgeons of England and the Royal College of Physicians, London.Regarding the form of the memorial, the Executive Committee made four proposals,starting with a memorial in Westminster Abbey and monument in London and including amajor prize for contributions to surgery or its science, and the preservation of the ListerWard in Glasgow as a museum:(i) a memorial in Westminster Abbey to take the form of a medallion or tablet, as spacewas limited;(ii) a monument in a public place in London;(iii) an International Lister Memorial Fund for the advancement of surgery, from whicheither grants in aid of research bearing on surgery, or awards in recognition ofdistinguished contributions to surgical science, should be made irrespective ofnationality, somewhat on the lines of the Nobel Prize;(iv) that in any appeal issued attention be called to the suggestion that has been madethat one of the wards of the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, should be preserved as amuseum in which objects of interest associated with Lord Lister and hisdiscoveries might be exhibited.16Fundraising strategyAlso in July 1912, plans for fundraising began in earnest and will sound familiar tofundraisers today. The first step was a meeting at the Mansion House hosted by the LordMayor of London to launch the appeal. A date in October was arranged and a list ofspeakers was drawn up, headed by the Prime Minister. In the end he was unable toattend, but the Lord Chancellor and others spoke.17income (£)192019120200040006000800010 00012 0001913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919totalsubscriptions/donationsinterest, dividendsand otherFigure 1.

The issue of whether the Lister Ward was international or localwas again negotiated and, to the dismay of the Glasgow representatives, dropped from thebody of the main appeal. Instead, a notice was inserted as a leaflet in the appeal to preserveone of the wards of the Royal Infirmary . . . where Lord Lister’s antiseptic methods werefirst put into practice . . . as a museum in which objects of interest associated with him andhis discoveries might be exhibited. . . . the Directors of the Infirmary have given theirsanction to the scheme. Objects, personal or otherwise, associated with Lister’s life andwork, are earnestly desired, and will be gladly received by the Superintendent, RoyalInfirmary, Glasgow.18The Mansion House meeting raised donations of just over £800, providing an initial list ofdonors associated with the appeal. The appeal was widely targeted in Britain and Ireland,starting with heads of universities, presidents of the medical societies and of the branchesof the British Medical Association (BMA), the mayors of London boroughs and largeprovincial towns, City livery companies, scientific societies, the principal hospitals, and aselected list of members of the medical profession and other individuals likely to beinterested. London bankers, members of Lloyds and the Stock Exchange were included,and advertisements were inserted in newspapers.19Fundraising resultsMost donations (figure 1), more than £6000, came in the first six months between theMansion House meeting in October 1912 and the end of February 1913.A second round of newspaper advertising went out after Easter 1913. At this stage thecolonies and foreign countries were approached, via an appeal sent to 277 presidents ofthe universities and societies that had made Lord Lister a member or awarded him anhonorary degree.20 Over the next four months, a further £1500 was received, including£323 from the appeal abroad, bringing the total to about £7600 by June 1913.21 Duringthe next year donations flattened out, with £1200 being added by July 1914. By then, atotal of 17 500 appeals had been sent by post to the medical profession and the generalpublic in the UK and 300 letters to institutions in the colonies and foreign countries.Donations amounted to £8888.2287% 13%Figure 2.

Dupree266 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from In the end, the bulk of the donations (87%) came from Great Britain and Ireland, withthe rest (about £1000) from the colonies and foreign countries (figure 2). Althoughdonations by 1914 amounted to approximately £700 000 at today’s prices, the Committeewas disappointed that the contributions were not enough to endow adequately a SurgicalResearch Fund.23 Lister’s universal acclaim had practical limits.ImplementationHowever, by June 1913 the Lister Memorial Fund was large enough to begin to implementthe memorial plans. The first priority was the plaque in Westminster Abbey (figure 3a).A site in the Abbey near Darwin’s burial place was agreed, and Sir Thomas Brock, wellknown for the statue of Prince Albert in the Albert Memorial and for the statue of QueenVictoria in the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace, accepted andcompleted the commission for £700 in 1915.24No further action took place until 1920, but this also meant that there was little expenditureand the bulk of the donations were invested.25 So, despite little in the way of further donations,the Fund did well out of the war, adding £2300 from investments, or 25% to the £9332received from subscriptions. Yet with postwar inflation it lost roughly half its prewar value.After the war the Executive Committee picked up where it had left off.26 There wascontinuity in the individuals most closely involved, including Bradford, Cheyne and Godlee.It moved quickly to establish an International Lister Memorial Fund for the advancement ofsurgery, which provided a bronze medal (figure 3b), awarded every three years, irrespectiveof nationality, in recognition of distinguished contributions to surgical science, and requiredthe recipient to give an address in London under the auspices of the Royal College ofSurgeons of England. The award would be made by a committee with seven representativesof the Royal Society, the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and the universities of Edinburgh andGlasgow. Any surplus income of the Fund would be either devoted to furthering surgicalscience by means of grants or re-invested. A challenge for the existing Lister MemorialCommittee was to ensure that this part of the Memorial would be on a permanent basis,(a) (c)(b)Figure 3. Implementation of the memorial plans.

As a result, the Royal College of Surgeons ofEngland agreed to become the Trustees and administer the Fund.27The Executive Committee also moved quickly to erect a monument in a public place. Itarranged a site in Portland Place and invited Sir George Frampton (1860–1928), best knownfor his statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, to undertake the commission for 4000guineas. The Committee’s members wanted Frampton so much that when he initiallyreplied that he would not be able to begin work within the next four years, theCommittee, in its only recorded vote, decided to commission him anyway. To theirdismay, in the end, Frampton declined the invitation.28After this rebuff, the Committee turned again to Sir Thomas Brock, who accepted. ByJune 1922 Brock had completed the bust and sent it to the foundry; the large femalefigure was nearly complete, and only the figure of the boy remained. Then near disasterstruck: in August Sir Thomas Brock died. Fortunately the work was far enough along thatBrock’s assistant could complete the memorial (figure 3c), although the Committeerequired assessment by an outside expert before allowing him to proceed.29The King, the Prince of Wales and Lord Balfour turned down invitations to unveil thestatue. In the end, the President of the Royal Society performed the ceremony in 1924,before ‘a small but representative gathering’. According to The Times the ceremony ‘wasbrief and quiet but lost nothing in effectiveness for that’. Also in 1924 the unexpendedbalance of the Fund was handed to the Royal College of Surgeons as arranged, and theLister Memorial Committee ended.30M. W. Dupree268 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from The Lister Memorial Committee had succeeded in, but not exceeded, its aims. It leftthe memorial in Westminster Abbey, the statue in Portland Place in London, and theinternational Lister Medal for surgery, and the Lecture and fund administered bythe Royal College of Surgeons of England. Having started with a large constituency ofprominent men, ‘not only distinguished in science and surgery, but also . . . of eminence inpublic life and in various branches of knowledge, both at home and abroad’,31 there wasonly a handful remaining at the end.It is not clear whether sufficient contributions, donations and bequests would have beenforthcoming to establish a Surgical Research Fund as the Lister Memorial Sub-Committeehoped at its last meeting on 24 July 1914, but the outbreak of World War I days latermade failure a certainty. Mourning and memorials became a major preoccupation duringand after the war throughout the UK and combatant countries, as financial resources andemotional energy were directed to collective commemoration.32 Moreover, the sharpdownturn in the UK economy hindered fundraising drives immediately after the war, asthose attempting to commemorate the centenary of James Watt’s birth found in 1919.33LATER COMMEMORATIONS: 1927–67The Lister Centenary 1927However, less than two years after the Lister Memorial Committee transferred the finaltranche of funds to the Royal College of Surgeons, that committee became the model forthe organization to arrange the celebrations in London for the centenary of Lister’s birth,and some of the same individuals reappear. Again the Royal Society took the lead. At theend of April 1926 the Society’s President chaired a meeting of delegates unanimously infavour of a celebration to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Lord Lister.34 Themeeting appointed an Executive Committee to ‘formulate proposals, but without plenarypowers’. Again, Sir John Rose Bradford served as its secretary.This meeting of delegates, however, differed from the large General Committee with plenarypowers of 1912. Gone were the Archbishop of Canterbury and Master of the Rolls, theAmbassadors, the Speaker and the Prime Minister; gone was the combination of institutionsand individuals. Instead there were delegates from 51 leading medical institutions in thecountry: the Royal Colleges, the Royal Society, the Society of Apothecaries, medicalsocieties, 11 major London hospitals and the Lister Institute, the Glasgow Royal andWestern Infirmaries, the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and 18 universities and colleges withmedical schools. Watson Cheyne was the only individual invited in his own capacity. Thiswas to be a celebration by the medical profession.As can be seen from the programme (table 1), the centenary celebrations in London in1927 spread over three days centred on 5 April, Lister’s birthday. There are several pointsto note about the programme. First, it included national recognition of the importance ofsurgery, surgeons and the medical profession more generally in the form of the receptionby the King at Buckingham Palace to open the celebrations, and the next day a receptionby the Prime Minister at BMA House. The latter included appreciations by a Frenchdelegate and a German delegate, emphasizing the international dimension of thecelebration. Second, the afternoon and evening of the first day were entirely taken up withreminiscences of Lister by his surviving students, dressers and assistants. They stressedhis achievements and his exemplary personal characteristics. Third, on the afternoon ofTable 1.

Finally, the exhibition of the Lister Collection at the WellcomeHistorical Medical Museum was on the programme, although the reception that themuseum held for 500 delegates on 6 April was not allowed to be listed.35The London celebration was not the only Lister Centenary celebration in 1927.36 Amongothers were one in Glasgow on 1 April, one in Carlisle on 5 April to mark the town’sconnection with Lister’s use of carbolic, and the BMA’s annual meeting in Edinburgh inJuly, which was a celebration of the centenary, including an exhibition of 298 ‘ListerRelics’ and a volume containing reminiscences of his students and assessments ofdevelopments in fields related to his work.37The Lister Centenary celebrations in London in 1927 were a celebration of hisachievements and personal attributes. Yet there was also a changing constituency for thecommemorative activity from that immediately after Lister’s death, a new attempt toassess his legacy for surgery and related fields, and in 1927 no attempt to raise money.Lister centenaries: Glasgow 1965 and London 1967Since 1927, despite the deaths of his remaining former students, the medical profession inparticular continued to recognize and celebrate Lister centenaries and use them to assessdevelopments in areas of medicine and science related to Lister’s work.38 Centenarycommemorations in Glasgow in 1965 marked his development and application in 1865 ofantiseptic surgical techniques, and celebrations in London in 1967 commemorated thecentenary of their first publication in The Lancet in 1867. Both events were detachedfrom consideration of Lister as a person, although not for the reasons of personal scandalthat lay behind the celebration of the 40th anniversary of Koch’s ‘discovery’ of thetubercle bacillus in 1922.39 The commemorations no longer emphasized Lister as a ‘moralCentenary of Lister’s introduction of the antiseptic treatment of wounds – Honorary Graduation Ceremony – Memorial Lecture – Scientific Meeting Scientific Meeting, Lister Lecture Theatre, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, 27–28 September 1965 1.

The 31 participants came from medical schools and institutes around theworld, and the papers were published together in a single edited volume (figure 4b). Thesymposium associated Glasgow and the university with innovation and progress, and wasseen as a ‘fitting part of the commemoration of the work which [Lister] began a hundredyears ago and which remains relevant, viable and productive to-day . . . the contributions. . . [being] exciting and stimulating, forward-looking rather than retrospective’.41In 1967 the Royal College of Surgeons of England took the initiative and organized amajor conference in London to commemorate the centenary of the publication of Lister’sfirst papers on antiseptic surgery.42 Close to the dates of their publication in March andApril, the conference coincided with Lister’s birthday, 5 April. The Queen agreed to bethe patron of the conference and sent a message. The conference theme was ‘SafeFigure 5.

Because Lister was a pioneer of implants in surgery, Michael Debakey gave atalk to an overflow audience about his work on materials for heart valve replacements,including a film of them in operation.43 Similarly, Edinburgh held a ‘scientific symposiumon antibiotics’.44Thus, since his death, commemorations of Lister have taken a wide variety of forms.According to the Glasgow Herald, the variety of commemorative options was one of theattractions of the proposals put forward by the Glasgow Lister Memorial Committee in1912. Yet one of the Glasgow Committee’s proposals, namely to preserve a Lister Wardin the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and create a museum, caused a major public controversy.CONTROVERSY: THE LISTER WARDAs mentioned above, in October 1912 the establishment of a Lister Museum in the ListerWard of the Royal Infirmary failed to retain its designation as an ‘international’ memorialthat would benefit from the ‘international funds’ raised by the Lister Memorial Committeein London. Nevertheless, by the time it launched its separate appeal at the end ofDecember 1912, the Glasgow Committee was proud of having been first in the field andof the ‘hearty co-operation’ with the London Memorial Committee.45 When a delegationfrom Edinburgh suggested to the Glasgow Committee that it join in promoting an appealfor a Scottish national memorial to Lister in the form of research laboratories, theGlasgow Committee persuaded them that this was already met by the aims of the LondonCommittee, the strong Scottish representation on it, and the arrangements for sharedfundraising, for both international and local forms of memorial.46With the proposal to preserve a Lister Ward (figure 6) and create a museum in it providingthe main local focus for the appeal, one of the Glasgow Committee’s first steps in March1912 was to obtain the approval of the Managers of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Theapproval did not bind future Managers, and there was some opposition: the motion passedFrom mourning to scientific legacy 273 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from by 12 votes to 8. The supporters, however, took the view that, as time passed, interest andsupport would increase, making any reversal unlikely.47In 1912 the Royal Infirmary was coming to the end of a controversial, costly completerebuilding on the same site, rather than move to a more spacious suburban location.Beginning in 1905, the project involved the demolition of the original eighteenth-centurybuilding designed by Robert Adam and the surgical block, opened in 1864, where Listerhad worked. In 1912 the surgical block was still in use and not due for demolition until1914.48 Plans proceeded smoothly. The Glasgow Lister Memorial Committee raised about£2600 from its local appeal and acquired relics for the museum, after the Mansion Housemeeting and the leaflet inserted in the London Committee’s appeal in 1912.49Suddenly in April 1914 the Managers voted to revoke the 1912 approval for the retentionof the Lister Ward by 13 votes to 8. The grounds for removal included several concerns: (i) itwas a septic menace to the neighbouring wards in the new building; (ii) it was an‘obstruction to light and air’; (iii) it occupied space needed for other purposes; and (iv) itwas out of keeping with the new building, and interfered with a proper view of thesebuildings from the public thoroughfares.50 Correspondence appeared in local and nationalperiodicals, overwhelmingly against the action of the Managers, and supporters refutedthe reasons given, point by point.51The University of Glasgow offered to rebuild, on its campus, the ward and operatingtheatre from the original materials, complicating the issue for supporters of retention. TheManagers voted again to demolish the ward, but to offer the materials to the University.Acrimony crept in when one of the Managers referred to the structure as ‘merely so muchstone and lime both worthless and injurious as an adjunct to the Infirmary’; the statementangered those ‘who regarded this workshop of Lister’s with a feeling of respect whichamounted almost to reverence’.52With the outbreak of war, discussion ended, and the ward was used for injured soldiers. Atthe end of the war the Managers faced a severe financial crisis and decided against immediatedemolition of the ward, because the cost had trebled since 1914 as a result of postwar inflation.53In 1921 Glasgow University withdrew its ‘offer to accept the materials of the Lister Ward forre-erection at Gilmorehill . . . because the site was to be put to another use’.54 In view of thiswithdrawal and pressure from the Glasgow Lister Memorial Committee, the Managers helda special meeting in October 1921, and again considered whether it was in the interests ofthe Infirmary to retain the ward.55 The ensuing discussion highlighted the opposing views:two Managers advocated the retention of the ward as the birthplace of antiseptic surgery, butthe new chairman advocated removal, saying ‘the want of free space applied as much, if notmore, to the Infirmary as to the University’; and another Manager further articulated the casefor demolition, arguing ‘that the whole of the reconstructed Infirmary was the best Memorialto Lord Lister’, as its design was largely the outcome of his discovery. The Managers werecharged with the preservation of the best interests of the Infirmary, and the permanentretention of the ward as a Lister Museum, however admirable in sentiment, was inconsonantwith the true purposes of the institution.56The Managers again voted to remove the ward. The Glasgow Lister Committee turned itsefforts to commissioning the statue of Lister as a memorial, unveiled in Kelvingrove Park(rather than the original site adjacent to the Infirmary) in September 1924 (see thefrontispiece to this issue of Notes & Records), but did not end its efforts to save the ward. Atthe start of 1922 it launched a new campaign. In July 1922 the BMA held its annual meetingin Glasgow. There were tours of the Lister Ward, vigorous support for its retention, andM. W. Dupree274 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from dismay at the situation in which ‘a shrine so unique in itself and which by virtue of its associationbelongs not to Glasgow only but to the civilized world should be wantonly destroyed’.57The supporters had to make the case for the value of the retention of the ward as amuseum on its original site, as opposed to other means of commemoration, such as amonument or a reconstruction. To do this the supporters drew heavily on religiousimagery and analogy. The Glasgow architect James Morris, for example, argued that theward was more than its building materials: ‘the disintegration of the material body carrieswith it severance from the soul, in the building, just as in the spiritual world’.58Support from the employee contributors whose funds were important to the Infirmaryreinforced the Managers’ position. So, with time running out, in September 1923 theMemorial Committee launched an even wider appeal to increase the pressure on theManagers to reverse their decision. They sent letters and printed circulars to prominentindividuals and medical institutions at home and abroad. An editorial in The Timesheaded ‘Vandalism in Glasgow’ attacked the attitude of the Infirmary’s Managers.59The response to these appeals exceeded the Committee’s expectations. Petitions to theManagers to retain the ward started rolling in from the French Academy of Medicine, theInternational Society of Surgeons of Belgium and other continental medical and surgicalbodies. More than 100 ‘of the most distinguished citizens of Glasgow’ signed a petition insupport of retention of the ward, including the Moderator of the General Assembly of theChurch of Scotland, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow, the President of the RoyalSociety of Edinburgh, two former Lord Provosts of Glasgow, and Members of Parliament.Funds were offered to the Managers, so cost was not a decisive factor. Most support camefrom the medical profession and especially from surgeons at home and abroad.60In December 1923, despite the petitions and the offers of funding, the Managers votedagain decisively to demolish the Lister Ward.61 Yet even this vote and the start ofdemolition on 21 January 1924 did not end the campaign to preserve the ward. A newappeal suggested that ‘if intervention is quick, the evil may even yet be averted’.62 In theHouse of Commons, MPs argued that the ward ‘should be regarded as a nationalmonument to a great benefactor of mankind’ and asked the Secretary of State forScotland to intervene to prevent demolition; the Secretary of State replied he did not havethe authority.63 The protests were to no avail. By the end of May ‘the last stone of thefamous Lister Ward was cast down’.64Thus, the Glasgow Lister Memorial Committee succeeded in its aim of raising funds for alocal monument to Lister to commemorate his link with the city and carried it out in the formof the statue in Kelvingrove Park, although not in its expected location opposite the RoyalInfirmary. It also succeeded in collecting Lister ‘relics’ for a museum. However, it failedspectacularly to commemorate Lister through the preservation of the Lister Ward at theRoyal Infirmary to house a museum. Why, despite worldwide appeals presented to theManagers, was it removed?The final decision in December 1923 was in the hands of the 36 Managers of the RoyalInfirmary, under the chairmanship of a businessman who had been a Manager for nearly25 years. The controversial rebuilding of the hospital, the resulting financial crisis,exacerbated by the war and postwar inflation, the role of the University of Glasgow’soffer to rebuild the ward on its campus, and the composition of the Board of Managersare important in understanding the decisions.65But the fundamental divide was between irreconcilable views of the relative value ofdifferent forms of commemoration. To the preservationists, the ward was not just ‘rocks(a) (b)Figure 7. Lister Ward compared with its re-creation in the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum.

It was the building as part of the Royal Infirmary and the space within it whereLister had worked that were crucial (figure 7), both for understanding and forcommemorating him and his achievement. Hence there were references to ‘reverence’,‘sentiment’, a ‘shrine’, a ‘place of inspiration and learning’. Like a chapel, they argued, itwas an appropriate part of a modern hospital, and it offered a unique opportunity for theInfirmary and the city.For those who favoured demolition, preservation of the ward as a museum was outsidetheir concept of the purpose of the hospital, namely the healing of the sick. Because itwas old, it was also not an appropriate part of a new, modern hospital. There wereaesthetic grounds, too, for opposition: it was not part of the architect’s plan for the newhospital. And on practical grounds of efficiency, with ground space in short supply, theopportunity cost was too high.If the assessment of the value of the ward as a building integral to the Royal Infirmary,namely as a ‘shrine’, was not sufficient for its preservation in situ, the value of its componentparts as ‘relics’ was soon clear.COLLECTIONIn January 1924, three days before the demolition started, C. J. S. Thompson, the curator ofthe Wellcome Historical Medical Museum (WHMM) began negotiations with the demolitioncompany that now owned the surviving furniture, fittings and eventually stones andtimbers.66Sir Henry Wellcome had established the WHMM in London before the war.67 Heamassed a vast collection of objects intending to illustrate the development of the manybranches of medicine and the healing arts from their beginnings to the present, and toconserve the relics of key discoverers in those lines of development as a permanenttribute. For this project he considered ‘the work of Lord Lister and the surroundings inwhich he worked to be of first importance’.68 The collection of Lister relics had a keyearly role in the creation of the museum as a ‘well-oiled collection machine’ to fulfilWellcome’s aim of creating a collection encompassing the complete history of medicine.69M. W. Dupree276 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from Seeing the Glasgow material in January, Wellcome’s curator decided not only to preserveobjects, but also to reconstruct a corner of the ward in the museum ‘to form a permanentrecord’ of Lister’s work (figure 7). He arranged for photographs, and by April 1924 hehad both purchased the bath, ventilator, round table, door, mantelpiece and window sashfrom the demolition firm, and had persuaded the Infirmary’s Managers to give themuseum a few articles of the period, including two beds, a fracture board, a wardarmchair, two ward night stools, two small bedside stools, a rough old dresser and a gasbracket, although he admitted that ‘none of these articles can be connected with the Wardin Lister’s time’.70The clear importance of Lister to the museum stimulated further collection, and thestaff adopted a policy of following up ‘all important relics’ by returning to Glasgowwhere material was still available from the contractors. This time the new curator, LouisMalcolm, and his colleague Johnston Saint proudly reported to Wellcome that they hadacquired ‘window sashes with original glass, 160 thirteen-foot-long joists, mahogany railsand irons, a 30-foot long main beam, a round table, three basins, three ventilators, the twoleaf-doors of the ward, etc.—all at house-breakers’ prices, £74.15.5d’.71 This success ledthe curators to formulate a general ‘system of following up all material which may beavailable, belonging to eminent men’.72In the case of Lister, the follow-up also included much contact with the Lister family andled to the acquisition of material from the Lister Institute. In addition, the museum compileda list of Lister’s former dressers, clerks and house surgeons and wrote to each asking forletters and items related to Lister. By early June 1926 the curator told Henry Wellcome‘we have practically the whole of Lister’s material in our possession, either on permanentloan or by presentation’.73The timing could not have been better. Henry Dale, from the newly formed committee tocelebrate the Lister Centenary in London in April 1927, visited the museum. He wasimpressed. He told the curator that ‘there was a proposal that a temporary building shouldbe put up in the court at Burlington House as a Lister Museum for the centenary, but hesaid that the RCS [Royal College of Surgeons of England] was not going to allow theirmaterial out of their building.’ The Wellcome Curator replied immediately he was certainthat Henry Wellcome would not allow his Lister material to be moved.74In the end, as we have seen, the WHMM did house the official Exhibition of the LondonLister Centenary listed on the programme, and held a reception in the museum for delegateson the final day. The museum used the exhibition to extend its collection, in competitionwith other collectors. Having acquired objects on loan for the exhibition, the museumoffered at its conclusion to provide a permanent home.75 In addition, Wellcome held tohis policy of not lending objects from his collection. Instead, he had duplicates made forthe Lister Centenary exhibitions in Edinburgh in July and in the USA, thus not missingthe opportunity to raise the profile of the collection and enhance its status, particularlyamong his intended audience: the medical profession.CONCLUSIONWhat can we learn from this brief survey of Lister commemorations in Britain since hisdeath?From mourning to scientific legacy 277 on April 28, 2014rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from First, Lister’s universal acclaim had its limits. The London Lister Memorial Committeedeveloped an effective representative organization based in the Royal Society, and itraised enough funds for its specific aims but not enough for the large surgical researchfund that had been envisaged. At the same time, the Glasgow Lister Memorial Committeerepresented Glasgow nationally and was successful in fundraising locally, yet it failed inits aim to preserve the Lister Ward.Second, although professional identity formation for surgeons is a continuing themethroughout the twentieth century, World War I marked a change in the constituencies forcommemorating Lister from broadly international, national and local, to more narrowlyprofessional. In addition, in the 1920s religious imagery characterized the memorialists inthe postwar debate about commemoration, emerging strongly in the words used, forexample ‘relics’, ‘body’ and ‘soul’, and especially ‘shrine’.Third, controversy over the Lister Ward emphasizes that Lister’s is a living heritage that isinherently controversial. It raises issues of what is the best form of surgical commemoration.Is it the continuing work of the hospital itself, as the Managers argued? Or is it a museum?However, even if it is a museum, the vision of the supporters of the retention of the ListerWard, although similar in many ways, was not what ended up as the Lister Wardreconstructed in the WHMM, and it raises wider issues surrounding the preservation ofhistoric buildings.Finally, while the medals and orations continue,76 the forms of commemoration sinceLister’s death have tended to shift from plaques and sculptures in public places togatherings to celebrate achievements and discuss the current state of subjects related toLister’s work. In 1927, 1965 and 1967 and in the Lister Conference in Edinburgh inFebruary 2012, participants on the programmes were primarily from the medicalprofession, particularly surgeons. The Lister commemorative conference in London overthree days in March 2012 followed in the same tradition of using Lister to assess currentissues, but it was unusual in the breadth of issues and range of backgrounds ofparticipants. It demonstrated that Lister’s precise position in the history of surgery is stillcontentious, but his importance as an iconic figure in the history of the medicalprofession is secure. It is only 14 years until the bicentenary of his birth on 5 April 2027,and it would be a good bet that there will be a commemoration—keep the date free.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSI would like to thank Professor Jinty Nelson, Professor Brian Hurwitz, Professor RickTrainor and Professor Anne Crowther for their comments and suggestions; and RichardTrainor and Bruce Goatly for expert assistance with figures and illustrations.
