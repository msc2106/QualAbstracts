ABSTRACT: 
Previous studies have reported reliable associations between personality and music preferences, but have tended to rely on cross-genre preferences at the expense of preferences within a single subgenre. We sought to overcome this limitation by examining associations between individual differences and preferences for a specific subgenre of music, namely, contemporary heavy metal. A total of 414 individuals from Britain were presented with clips of 10 tracks of contemporary heavy metal and asked to rate each for liking. Participants also completed measures of the Big Five personality traits, attitudes toward authority, self-esteem, need for uniqueness, and religiosity. A multiple regression showed that stronger composite preference for the heavy metal tracks was associated with higher Openness to Experience, more negative attitudes toward authority, lower self-esteem, greater need for uniqueness, and lower religiosity. In addition, men showed a significantly stronger preference for the tracks than women (d = 0.54). These results are discussed in terms of the psychological needs that contemporary heavy metal fills for some individuals.

 Metalheads: The Influence of Personality and Individual Differences onPreference for Heavy MetalViren SwamiUniversity of Westminster and HELP University CollegeFiona Malpass, David Havard, Karis Benford,Ana Costescu, Angeliki Sofitiki, and Donna TaylorUniversity of WestminsterPrevious studies have reported reliable associations between personality and music preferences, but havetended to rely on cross-genre preferences at the expense of preferences within a single subgenre. Wesought to overcome this limitation by examining associations between individual differences andpreferences for a specific subgenre of music, namely, contemporary heavy metal. A total of 414individuals from Britain were presented with clips of 10 tracks of contemporary heavy metal and askedto rate each for liking.

By contrast, scholars have paid other aesthetic domains—such as literature, film, and fashion—much less attention, which isnotable because domain type may be an important moderator ofpreferences. For example, it is thought that music is one domain inwhich preferences are idiosyncratic, irrespective of one’s appreci-ation of other artistic domains (North & Hargreaves, 1999; terBogt, Raaijmakers, Vollebergh, van Well, & Sikkema, 2003), andthat music preferences form an important part of one’s identity,especially in adolescence and young adulthood (Rentfrow & Gos-ling, 2006, 2007; Selfhout, Branje, ter Bogt, & Meeus, 2009).Although the importance of music in everyday life is widelyacknowledged (North, Hargreaves, & O’Neill, 2000; Schwartz &Fouts, 2003), the factors that shape music preferences could bebetter understood. In the 1980s, media psychologists began toemphasize the importance of considering motives for culturalconsumption (Rosengren, Wenner, & Palmgreen, 1985). From thisperspective, it was suggested that individuals prefer and selectcertain types of music because they have personality traits that themusic satisfies (Arnett, 1995; Arnett, Larson, & Offer, 1995;Larson, 1995). For example, individuals who have a desire forintellectual stimulation and novel aesthetic experiences are ex-pected to show a preference for complex forms of music. Inaddition, music selections may also fulfill physiologically basedneeds (Eysenck, 1990; Zuckerman, 1979), such as when extravertsselect music that raises their low cortical arousal (Berlyne, 1960).This work led to a revival of interest in the aesthetics of musicfrom a differential perspective (e.g., Dollinger, 1993; McCown,Keiser, Mulhearn, & Williamson, 1997). It is now widely ac-knowledged that there are reliable associations between musicpreferences and personality (Pearson & Dollinger, 2002; Rentfrow& McDonald, 2009; Schwartz & Fouts, 2003), with the lattercommonly being operationalized using the Big Five traits. Schol-ars working from this perspective hypothesize that personalitytraits influence preferences for music, both in terms of establishedpreferences for particular genres and pieces of music (Rentfrow &Gosling, 2006; Rentfrow & McDonald, 2009), as well as in theshort term (e.g., in response to hearing novel or unfamiliar musicin laboratory settings; Hunter & Schellenberg, 2011; Ladinig &Schellenberg, 2012).In summarizing established relationships between musical di-mensions and personality traits, Rentfrow and Gosling (2003)reported that a preference for reflective and complex music (de-fined by the blues, jazz, classical, and folk music) and intense andrebellious music (rock, alternative, and heavy metal) was posi-This article was published Online First October 14, 2013.Viren Swami, Department of Psychology, University of Westminster,London, United Kingdom, and Department of Psychology, HELP Univer-sity College, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Fiona Malpass, David Havard,Karis Benford, Ana Costescu, Angeliki Sofitiki, and Donna Taylor, De-partment of Psychology, University of Westminster, London, United King-dom.Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to VirenSwami, Department of Psychology, University of Westminster, 309 RegentStreet, London W1B 2UW, United Kingdom.

Finally, a preference for energetic andrhythmic music (rap, hip-hop, soul and funk, and electronica anddance music) was positively correlated with Extraversion andAgreeableness. These associations were generally supported in amore recent, longitudinal study with Dutch adolescents (Delsing,ter Bogt, Engels, & Meeus, 2008).Although this research is important, one drawback of thesestudies is that they have examined cross-genre preferences at theexpense of preferences within a single genre of music. That is,although it is important to examine the way individual differencesaffect preferences for musical genres that differ across multipledimensions, this method possibly obscures unique associationswhen the focus is on musical pieces that are defined by the sameartistic style (cf. Swami, Pietschnig, Stieger, Nader, & Voracek,2012; Swami, Stieger, Pietschnig, & Voracek, 2010). To overcomethis dearth in the literature, the present study examined associa-tions between individual differences and preference for contem-porary heavy metal, a subgenre of rock music with historical rootsin blues and psychedelic rock (Weinstein, 2000).Relative to early heavy metal, contemporary metal (e.g., metal-core, extreme metal, thrash metal)—also sometimes called theNew Wave of Heavy Metal (Sharpe-Young, 2005)—is specificallycharacterized by heavy guitar riffs, double-bass drumming, break-downs (slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing, i.e.,a style of dance in which participants push or slam into each other),and overall loudness (Dee, 2009; Sharpe-Young, 2005; Wagner,2010). In addition, the vocalizing technique in contemporary metalis generally unpitched vocals (e.g., shouting, shrieking, and growl-ing), although some bands combine this with clean, melodic vocals(Wallach, Berger, & Greene, 2011). Rhythmically, contemporaryheavy metal songs are emphatic, with highly complex rhythmicphrases (Waksman, 2009) and a wide range of tempos tendingtoward the extremes (e.g., slow-ballad tempos have quarter notesof 60 beats per min, whereas blast-beat tempos have quarter notesof about 350 beats per min; Sharpe-Young, 2005, 2007). It is thesequalities of contemporary heavy metal that distinguish it fromearlier incarnations and make it interesting from a scholarly pointof view.To be sure, a small body of work has investigated the aestheticsof heavy metal music or its fans (Baugh, 1993). For example, inearly sociological work, Arnett (1993, 1996) highlighted a “sub-culture of alienation” among heavy metal fans, which, in turn, wasthought to translate into an opposition to authority and a construc-tion of the self as an outsider in relation to mainstream society(Brown, 1995; Weinstein, 2000). It has also been suggested thatheavy metal may serve a “purgative function, dissipating accumu-lated anger and frustration” with established authority or main-stream society (Arnett, 1991, p. 76) and that its cathartic potentialmay help promote more positive self-evaluations among fans(Henry & Caldwell, 2007). Moreover, through the consumption ofheavy metal music and related products, fans may form andmaintain a sense of individual and collective uniqueness (Snell &Hodgetts, 2007).Some studies have also examined associations between individ-ual difference traits and a preference for rock or metal music (e.g.,Shafron & Karno, 2013). One study presented undergraduates withvideo recordings of hard-rock music and reported that viewingenjoyment was positively associated with psychoticism and rebel-liousness (Robinson, Weaver, & Zillman, 1996). The same studyalso indicated that men were more likely than women to enjoy therecordings, which is consistent with suggestions that rock andmetal can be instrumental in the construction of masculinity (Fast,2005; Weinstein, 2009). Fans of heavy metal also appear to be lessreligious than nongenre fans (Arnett, 1991), and it has also beensuggested that heavy metal fans are anticulture in the sense thatthey oppose hegemonic mainstream music and culture (Rana,2008). Finally, stereotypic depictions of metal fans suggest thatthey are violent and antisocial (Wright, 2000), but empirical evi-dence is mixed: One study reported no significant associationbetween a preference for heavy metal and behavioral problems(Epstein, Pratto, & Skipper, 1990), whereas others have reportedthat heavy metal listeners are more violent (Hansen & Hansen,1991) and are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such asusing drugs and stealing (Klein et al., 1993; Weisskirch & Murphy,2004).The present study sought to build on this work by examining theinfluence of individual difference traits on preference for contem-porary heavy metal, operationalized by computing a compositeindex of liking for 10 heavy metal tracks by contemporary bandsthat fit the New Wave tag (Sharpe-Young, 2005). In this way, wewere able to measure preference for songs that conform to genre-specific characteristics, as described earlier. In addition, we mea-sured participants’ Big Five personality traits, with the expectationthat preference for heavy metal would be positively associatedwith Openness to Experience. This is based on the previous findingthat a preference for heavy metal was significantly associated withOpenness (Delsing et al., 2008; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003). Bycontrast, we did not expect significant associations with other BigFive traits, although we did include these for preliminary analyses.In addition to the Big Five traits and based on the review here,we also included measures of need for uniqueness, self-esteem,attitudes toward authority, and religiosity. The former variablerefers to a desire to create and maintain a sense of uniqueness,particularly in social settings (Lynn & Snyder, 2002). Given dis-cussions of heavy metal as facilitating a subculture of alienationand a construction of the self as an outsider, we hypothesized thata preference for heavy metal would be significantly associatedwith higher need for uniqueness. Self-esteem, on the other hand,refers to an overall emotional evaluation of one’s worth (Mruk,2006), and we expected a negative association between self-esteemand a preference for heavy metal. This was based on the possibilitythat the cathartic potential of heavy metal is sought by individualswho have low self-esteem. Finally, we hypothesized that a pref-erence for heavy metal would be associated with more negativeattitudes toward authority and lower religiosity, which is consistentwith Arnett’s (1991) work.MethodParticipantsThe participants of this study were 219 women and 195 menranging in age from 18 to 57 years (M  25.30, SD  9.31). Themajority of participants were of British White descent (88.4%),ThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly.378 SWAMI ET AL.and the remainder were Asian (7.2%), African Caribbean (1.4%),or other ancestry (2.9%). In terms of educational qualifications,43.4% had completed secondary education, 43.5% were still infull-time (university) education, 10.1% had an undergraduate de-gree, and 3.0% had a postgraduate degree.MaterialsHeavy metal tracks. We initially selected 10 tracks by 10heavy metal bands that fit the New Wave tag (see Sharpe-Young,2005). The final list consisted of three heavy metal bands, twometalcore bands, two progressive metal bands, one power metal band,one thrash metal band, and one extreme metal band (see Appendix forband names, tracks, albums the tracks were taken from, and year thetracks were released in the United Kingdom). All bands that wereincluded in the present study had a minimum of four members (adrummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, and a vocalist), and four of thetracked included the use of musical keyboards or synthesizers, as inthe norm for the band in question. For each band, we selected oneexemplar track, from which we then extracted a 60-s clip, alwaysfrom the middle of the track. Participants were presented with theseclips and asked to rate each for personal preference on a 7-point scale(1  extreme dislike, 7  extreme like). Treatment of these data isdiscussed in the Results section.Big Five personality traits. We measured the Big Five per-sonality traits using the Mini International Personality Item Pool(Mini-IPIP; Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006), a 20-itemshort form of the full IPIP measure (Goldberg, 1999). Participantswere asked to rate the extent to which a series of statementsaccurately described themselves on a 5-point Likert-type scale(1 very inaccurate, 5 very accurate). Subscale scores for eachof the Big Five traits were computed as the mean of four itemsassociated with each factor, respectively, following reverse codingof some items. The Mini-IPIP has been shown to have goodinternal consistency, good patterns of convergent and discriminantvalidity, similar coverage of facets as other broad Big Five mea-sures, and good test–retest reliability up to several months (Don-nellan et al., 2006). In the present study, internal consistencycoefficients (Cronbach’s alpha) for all subscales were  .63,which is consistent with previous work (Donnellan et al., 2006).Specific coefficients were as follows: Extraversion, .68; Ideas/Openness to Experience, .70; Agreeableness, .65; Conscientious-ness, .65; and Neuroticism, .64.Need for uniqueness. Need for uniqueness was measuredusing the 32-item Uniqueness Scale (Snyder & Fromkin, 1977),which assessed an individual’s desire to create and maintain asense of uniqueness, especially in public and social settings. Par-ticipants were asked to rate each item on the scale on a 5-pointLikert-type scale (1  strongly disagree, 5  strongly agree), andan overall score was computed as the mean of all items, followingreverse coding of some items. Higher scores on this scale reflectgreater need for uniqueness. Snyder and Fromkin (1977) reportedthat the scale has good patterns of validity and good test–retestreliability up to 4 months. In the present study, Cronbach’s alphafor this scale was .82.Self-esteem. To measure self-esteem, we used Rosenberg’s(1965) Self-Esteem Scale, one of the most widely used measuresof an individual’s feelings of self-worth. The scale consists of 10items that are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1  stronglydisagree, 4  strongly agree). Several items were reversed codedprior to analysis and an overall score was computed as the mean ofall 10 items. Higher scores on this scale reflect greater self-esteem.Scores on this measure have been shown to have good internalconsistency and good patterns of validity (Whiteside-Mansell &Corwyn, 2003). In the present study, this scale had good internalconsistency (Cronbach’s alpha  .89).Attitudes toward authority. Participants’ evaluations of au-thority were measured using Reicher and Emler’s (1985) Attitudesto Authority Scale, which was adapted to exclude adolescent-targeted items referring to the fairness of school rules (Swami,Chamorro-Premuzic, & Furnham, 2010). The adapted measureconsists of 10 items that tap attitudes about institutional authority,bias by those in authority, and the absolute priority of rules. Allitems were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1  stronglydisagree, 5  strongly agree), and some items were reverse codedprior to analyses. An overall score was computed as the mean ofall items, with higher scores indicating more negative attitudestoward institutional authority. This adapted measure has beenshown to have adequate internal consistency and patterns of va-lidity (Swami, 2012; Swami, Chamorro-Premuzic, et al., 2010). Inthe present study, Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .76.Religiosity. Participants’ religiosity was measured using asingle-item measure of intrinsic religiosity (1  not at all reli-gious, 7  very religious). The use of a single item is limiting interms of breadth; nevertheless, single-item measures of religiosityhave been shown to have good validity among community samples(e.g., Abdel-Khalek, 2007).Demographics. Participants were asked to provide their de-mographic details, including gender, age, ethnicity, and highesteducational qualifications.ProceduresEthical approval for this study was obtained from the relevantuniversity ethics committee. Data collection for this study wasconducted online using an opportunistic sampling strategy. Theresearchers invited potential participants to complete a survey onmusic preferences via their contacts on a social networking site(i.e., Facebook). A total of 664 individuals opened the first page ofthe survey and 414 provided complete responses on the wholesurvey. The first page of the online survey presented participantswith brief information about the research project and allowed themto provide informed consent. The next page informed participantsthat they would be presented with several clips of music, whichthey would be asked to rate for personal preference. Participantswere also given instructions at this stage to turn the volume ontheir computers to a comfortable level and to listen to the clips intheir entirety before making their ratings. On the next 10 pages,participants were presented with the selected tracks, which loadedautomatically once the page had been accessed, and were able toprovide their ratings. The 10 tracks were presented in a randomorder for each participant. Subsequent pages of the survey pre-sented measures of the Big Five, need for uniqueness, self-esteem,attitudes toward authority, religiosity, and demographic, in thispredefined order. The final page of the survey presented partici-pants with debriefing information, including contact details of thecorresponding author. All participants took part on a voluntarybasis and were not remunerated for participation.ThisdocumentiscopyrightedbytheAmericanPsychologicalAssociationoroneofitsalliedpublishers.Thisarticleisintendedsolelyforthepersonaluseoftheindividualuserandisnottobedisseminatedbroadly.379INFLUENCES ON PREFERENCES FOR HEAVY METALResultsFactor AnalysisWe initially subjected preference ratings of the 10 music clips toprinciple-axis exploratory factor analysis using the total sample. Bar-tlett’s test of sphericity, 2(45)  3429.43, p  .001, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy (KMO  .89)showed that the 10 items had adequate common variance for factoranalysis. We therefore computed a factor analysis using quartimaxrotation because we expected the emergence of a single, generalfactor. Examination of the results indicated that only one factor had aneigenvalue1.0 (  5.85; 54.5% of the variance explained). All 10items loaded on to this first factor with loadings .66, which farexceed Kline’s (1986) recommended cutoff of .40. These resultsindicate that it was acceptable to compute a composite index ofpreference for the music clips, which we did by taking the mean of all10 ratings. The internal consistency coefficient of this measure wasvery good (Cronbach’s alpha  .94).Further AnalysesDescriptive statistics for all variables included in the presentstudy are reported in Table 1. Preliminary examination of the dataindicated that men (M  3.65, SD  1.44) showed a strongerpreference for the clips than women (M  1.94, SD  1.24). Anindependent samples t test indicated that this difference was sig-nificant, t(413)  5.44, p  .001, d  0.54. There were nosignificant correlations between preference for the clips and par-ticipant age, r  .05, p  .360, or educational qualifications, r .05, p  .358, so these variables were not analyzed further. In asimilar vein, there were no significant differences in preference forthe clips between White and non-White participants, t(412) 1.61, p  .109, d  0.16. We next computed bivariate correlationsbetween the composite preference score and participants’ score onmeasures of the Big Five, need for uniqueness, self-esteem, atti-tudes toward authority, and religiosity. As shown in Table 1,stronger preference for the heavy metal clips was significantlycorrelated with higher Openness, more negative attitudes towardauthority, greater need for uniqueness, lower self-esteem, andlower religiosity.We next computed a multiple linear regression (enter method)with the composite preference score as the criterion variable andall remaining variables as predictors. Results showed that theregression was significant, F(9, 413)  11.59, p  .001, adjustedR2  .19. Of the variables entered into the model, Opennessemerged as the strongest predictor (  .25, t  5.48, p  .001).In addition, attitudes toward authority (  .24, t  5.06, p .001), self-esteem (  .22, t  3.83, p  .001), need foruniqueness (  .14, t  2.96, p  .003), and religiosity ( .13, t  2.56, p  .011) also emerged as significant predictors.None of the other Big Five traits emerged as significant predictorsin this analysis (  .06, t  1.21, p  .225).DiscussionIn the past decade, it has become clear that there are reliableassociations between music preferences and individual psychologicaldifferences (Delsing et al., 2008; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003; Rent-frow & McDonald, 2009). However, this research has tended to focuson broad, nonexclusive genres of music at the expense of a focus onsingular, stylized genres. The present study sought to overcome thisdearth in the literature by focusing on preferences for a specificsubgenre, namely, contemporary heavy metal. Broadly speaking, ourresults support the assumption that personality and individual differ-ences are associated with preferences for particular music genres(Rentfrow & McDonald, 2009). Our results also build on earlier worksuggesting that heavy metal fans may have profiles that distinguishthem from fans of other musical genres (Arnett, 1991, 1993, 1996;Robinson et al., 1996; Weinstein, 2000).In terms of the Big Five personality traits, our results confirmprevious reports that Openness is associated with a preference for rockand heavy metal (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), including nonmain-stream subgenres (Delsing et al., 2008). In explanation, it has beensuggested that individuals who score highly on Openness show apreference for the intensity, variety, complexity, and unconvention-ality of heavy metal (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003; Rentfrow & Mc-Donald, 2009). Delsing et al. (2008) further postulated that individualswho are open-minded and who seek novel experiences may becomedisinterested in mainstream or conventional musical forms as theygrow older. This, in turn, may lead them to seek out musical genresTable 1Interscale Correlations Between, and Descriptive Statistics For, All Variables Included in the Present Study(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10)(1) Preference for heavy metal .04 .01 .01 .37 .03 .18 .14 .27 .13(2) Extraversion .06 .13 .07 .05 .18 .35 .11 .11(3) Agreeableness .20 .14 .31 .07 .02 .08 .02(4) Conscientiousness .17 .08 .06 .34 .03 .06(5) Ideas/Openness .20 .16 .19 .05 .01(6) Neuroticism .09 .02 .19 .13(7) Need for uniqueness .07 .16 .08(8) Self-esteem .08 .16(9) Attitudes to authority .10(10) ReligiosityM 3.27 3.19 4.03 3.37 2.86 4.03 2.90 2.90 3.11 2.06SD 1.38 0.92 0.67 0.72 0.94 0.75 0.37 0.59 0.38 1.62Note.

Rather, itseems more likely that they will be drawn to forms of music thatare intense, engaging, and challenging (Rentfrow, Goldberg, &Levitin, 2011), of which heavy metal is but one example. Never-theless, in our study, we were able to show that individuals whoare high in Openness show a stronger preference for tracks ofcontemporary heavy metal. One element of contemporary heavymetal that may make it more appealing to relatively open individ-uals is the use of screamed and unpitched vocals. This form ofvocalization likely transfers the burden of understanding amonglisteners onto intrinsic qualities associated with the music, whichrelatively open individuals may find more challenging and, there-fore, more engaging.Our results also showed that individuals with more negativeattitudes toward institutional authority were more likely to show apreference for the heavy metal tracks. In general, this is consistentwith Arnett’s (1993, 1996) description of heavy metal fans asinhabiting a subculture of alienation, which translates into anopposition to authority and mainstream society. The present resultsbuild on Arnett’s work: It is possible, for example, that heavymetal may conjure referent images that are inherently antiauthorityor that signal a revolt against mainstream culture. In this sense,individuals who hold more negative attitudes toward authority mayshow a preference for heavy metal precisely because it expressestheir dissatisfaction with authority (see also Leung & Kier, 2008).Respondents who showed a stronger preference for the metaltracks in the present study were also more likely to have lowerself-esteem and higher need for uniqueness. In the first instance, itis possible that individuals with relatively low self-esteem aredrawn to heavy metal because the style of music allows for a purgeof negative feelings. The catharsis afforded by heavy metal may, inturn, help boost self-worth and promote positive self-evaluationsamong those with otherwise low self-esteem (Henry & Caldwell,2007). In a similar vein, the demonstration of a preference for amusical genre that is outside the mainstream may help someindividuals feel more unique, thus helping them to create andmaintain a sense of both individual and collective uniqueness.Two further findings of the present study are worthy of mention.First, we found that a preference for heavy metal was associatedwith lower religiosity. This is consistent with Arnett’s (1991)finding that fans of heavy metal are significantly less religious thannongenre fans. It is possible that this association is driven byunderlying attitudes toward authority, which may include religiousauthorities. Finally, we found that men showed a stronger prefer-ence for the tracks than women, which corroborates previous workthat used video recordings of hard rock (Robinson et al., 1996).Previously work has discussed the ways in which heavy metal andrelated genres are used constructing, maintaining, and emphasizingmasculinity and male superiority (Fast, 2005; Weinstein, 2009; seealso Shank, 1994), which may help explain why this music is moreappealing to men.There are a number of important limitations with the design andimplementation of our study, which need to be acknowledged.First, our sampling method possibly introduced inherent biases,which means that our final sample is unlikely to have been repre-sentative of the wider British population (the high proportion ofrespondents still in full-time tertiary education, e.g., speaks to thisfact). In terms of design limitations, we note that we did not collectinformation about whether participants recognized the tracks or theartists, nor did we control for familiarity with the tracks. This isimportant because familiarity with a track may affect a respon-dents’ judgment of it: Aside from the possibility of idiosyncraticpreferences for certain tracks, previous exposure to a track mayenhance liking for it, even if participants do not explicitly remem-ber it (Zajonc, 1968). Conversely, overexposure to a track maydecrease liking, although there appear to be important interactionsbetween number of exposures and Openness to Experience thatdetermine liking for musical tracks (Hunter & Schellenberg,2011). In addition, the correlational design of our study means thatwe cannot draw firm, directional conclusions. For example, it ispossible that listening to heavy metal lowers self-esteem, ratherthan individuals with low self-esteem showing a preference forheavy metal. Finally, it is also possible that participants engaged inhypothesis guessing or provided socially desirable responses.Aside from including a measure of familiarity with each track,there are a number of additional ways in which our study could beimproved. First, our method of focusing on a particular subgenreof music should be replicated with other genres, which will help toascertain the reliability of earlier findings based on cross-genrepreferences (Delsing et al., 2008; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003).Indeed, our method of presenting participants with exemplar tracksof a musical subgenre may be more reliable, because it avoidspossible confusion in self-reported preferences in the absence of aframe of reference. Second, future research would do well toinclude measures with improved validity and reliability (e.g., com-pared with our single-item measure of religiosity) and a widerrange of individual difference traits. For example, previous studieshave reported both positive (Litle & Zuckerman, 1986; Rawlings,Vidal, & Furnham, 2000) and null (Glasgow, Cartier, & Wilson,1985) associations between a preference for rock music and sen-sation seeking. This issue could perhaps be clarified using themethodology we have described here. In a similar vein, it may beimportant in future research to include measures of preference fordifferent genres of music, listening habits, and uses of music.These limitations notwithstanding, our study contributes to theextant literature by showing that some individuals may be drawn toheavy metal because of their personalities. That is, individuals whoshow a particular constellation of individual difference traits (inparticular, high Openness, antiauthority attitudes, need for unique-ness, and low self-esteem) appear to show a stronger preference forcontemporary heavy metal. More broadly, our results may helpscholars to more fully understand why some individuals are at-tracted to nonmainstream music. Rather than stereotyping fans asdeviant, antisocial, or violent (Wright, 2000), it may be morefruitful to understand the psychological needs that contemporaryheavy metal fill for some individuals. Doing so may allow prac-titioners to better engage with fans of different forms of music.ReferencesAbdel-Khalek, A. M. (2007).
