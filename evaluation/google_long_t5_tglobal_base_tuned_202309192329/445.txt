ABSTRACT: 
What happens when standardised literacy assessments travel globally? The paper presents an ethnographic account of adult literacy assessment events in rural Mongolia. It examines the dynamics of literacy assessment in terms of the movement and re-contextualisation of test items as they travel globally and are received locally by Mongolian respondents. The analysis of literacy assessment events is informed by Goodwin’s ‘participation framework’ on language as embodied and situated interactive phenomena and by Actor Network Theory. Actor Network Theory (ANT) is applied to examine literacy assessment events as processes of translation shaped by an ‘assemblage’ of human and non-human actors (including the assessment texts).

This paperexamines what the ethnography of literacy assessment events can tell us about theprocess. As the work of Steiner-Khamsi (2012) suggests, ethnographic research atthe local–global interface provides insights into the character and dynamics of globa-lised literacy assessment. This case study of literacy assessment in Mongolia is pre-sented against a backdrop of increasingly ambitious, globalised projects ofeducational assessment. National assessments are integrated into larger internationalprogrammes, locating them within a ‘global ﬁeld of comparison’ (Rizvi and Lingard2010). That process involves distinct challenges of cross-cultural comparison and val-idity (Hambleton 2005).Our setting off point is Hamilton’s (2001) critique of psychometric literacy assess-ment. Hamilton applied Actor Network Theory (ANT) to describe how literacy assess-ment regimes privilege and frame knowledge about literacy (also Hamilton 2011,2012). She proposed a new direction of research, studying literacy assessmentregimes from the inside, including ethnographic investigation into the institutional pro-cesses of knowledge production, ‘procedures of evidence gathering’ and how assess-ment is ‘enacted at the local level’ (2001, 193). As Hamilton argued, the complexityof psychometric literacy data can easily become obscured and ‘technical decisionsand controversies’ rendered invisible in statistical results (192).This paper builds on those insights with a detailed ethnographic account of anational level adult literacy assessment that took place in Mongolia in 2010 as part© 2014 The Author.

The paperis in two parts. It begins with a detailed ethnographic description of unruly behaviourduring a literacy assessment event in the Mongolian Gobi. Ethnographic transcripts areused to explore what people’s behaviour during assessment can tell us about its cross-cultural demands. The second part describes the tensions that can exist between textualand contextual resources as they are employed by respondents in literacy assessmenttasks. This is particularly important for the analysis of the cross-cultural validity of ‘rea-listic’ test item content. The paper explores questions such as what familiarity with theMongolian camel can tell us about test item relevance, and what not being able to ﬁll ina simple form for employment in a fast food restaurant can reveal about the cultural,contextual and ideological agendas of standardised assessments. The ethnographicanalysis of assessment events provides an opportunity to examine people’s behaviourand their emotional and verbal interactions – the questions people ask and the responsesthey receive. This can inform understanding of how cognitive, affective, moral, contex-tual and cultural dimensions of assessment inform statistical outcomes. It goes withoutsaying that these kinds of data are rarely included in large-scale statistical analysis.This paper is informed theoretically by Goodwin’s ‘participation framework’, andby Actor Network Theory (ANT). Charles Goodwin’s work views the production ofcontext as an interactive social phenomenon. This includes the role of materialobjects such as assessment texts in communicative acts (see Duranti and Goodwin1992; Goodwin 2000, 2007). Goodwin’s work emphasises the situated and embodiedcharacter of human interaction and its spatial, affective and temporal dimensions. Theethnographic transcripts below provide a rich source of qualitative data about howpeople respond to test items and assessment tasks.The inclusion of Actor Network Theory (ANT) provides a complementary perspec-tive, explaining social action in terms of an ‘assemblage’ of human and non-human actors(Callon 1986; Latour 2005; Waltz 2006). The study of literacy assessment events illus-trates what ANT describes as the unpredictable and unstable processes of ‘translation’ asvarious actors and objects come together to form a network that constitutes particular set-tings and events (see Callon 1986; Fenwick and Edwards 2010; Hamilton 2011). In thecase of literacy assessment, qualitative insights into the dynamics of the assemblage areilluminating. They illustrate, among other things, the negotiation of power and authority,sources of motivation, the implications of cultural norms and expectations, and theresources that test respondents bring to the assessment event.The arrival in the Mongolian Gobi of distinctly foreign and unusual assessmenttexts, supported and accompanied by teams of staff and associated technicalmanuals, presents a novel context for ethnographic enquiry. While psychometric lit-eracy assessment strives methodologically for standardisation as good practice, the con-textualised process of assemblage in assessment involves features of social interactionthat are unplanned, chaotic and particular. This phenomena is described in ActorNetwork Theory with the concept of ‘irreducibility’ (Fenwick and Edwards 2010;Latour 2005), and similarly in the work of Bloome’s (1995) micro-ethnographicapproach as ‘indeterminacy’.We can apply the principle of irreducibility to analyse literacy assessment eventswhere globally mobile assessment texts are received in local contexts. Rizvi andLingard (2010) argue that while globalised educational policy and practice reveals fea-tures of ideological and methodological alignment, there is ‘nothing inevitable’ aboutoutcomes of globalisation that are ‘mediated at the national and local levels by particu-lar historical, political and cultural dynamics’ (3). As Rizvi and Lingard argue, we2 B. MaddoxDownloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 should consider how texts are received in sites that are far from those of their originalproduction, into what Bourdieu describes as new ﬁelds of reception (Bourdieu 1999).The analysis of assessment events draws our attention to their spatial, temporal andtranscontextual character. These aspects of assessment involve processes of movementand re-contextualisation (see Bernstein 1996; Blommaert, 2008, 2010; Brandt andClinton 2002; Kell 2000, 2006, 2011; Reder and Davila 2005). Three aspects of re-con-textualisation are considered: (i) in test item production, content from ‘everyday’ life isre-contextualised in Bernstein’s (1996) sense, as carefully crafted educational artefactsto be used in highly regulated domains of educational assessment; (ii) the ‘trafﬁc oftexts’ (Kell 2011, 613) along globalised networks of educational assessment. The cir-culation of assessment texts as valued exchange commodities or cultural goods; and(iii) questions of ‘semiotic mobility’ (Blommaert 2010, 3), or what Kell (2011)describes as ‘recontextualisations of meaning’ (609) as testees and other actorsattempt to make sense of texts and images during assessment events by drawing ontheir local knowledge and cultural resources (see Bourdieu 1999).As Steiner-Khamsi (2012) argues, ‘the focus on reception and translation lendsexplanatory power to local policy contexts’ (2012, 3). The local ethnographic analysisinvites us to question assumptions about the hegemony of national and global insti-tutions, and to explore new sources of institutional obligation, authority and afﬁnity.As Blommaert argues:The ‘margin’, so to speak, is not necessarily a space in which people fail to meet norms,but it can as well be seen as a space in which different but related norms are produced,responding – ‘ecologically’, so to speak – to local possibilities and limitations. (Blom-maert, 2010, 80–81)An anthropologist among the psychometriciansIn 2010 the author was invited to ethnographically observe the national adult literacyassessment conducted in Mongolia as part of the UNESCO Literacy Assessment andMonitoring Programme (LAMP). The aim of LAMP is to support national governmentsto produce robust statistics on adult literacy to inform educational policy and planning(Guadalupe and Cardoso 2011; UIS 2009).LAMP is an example of the ambitious, technically demanding and increasingly glo-balised projects of large-scale literacy assessment (i.e. literacy as numbers), that arepromoted as good practice by statistical organisations and trans-national institutionssuch as the OECD, UNESCO and theWorld Bank. LAMP shares many methodologicalfeatures and some content with other assessment projects (e.g. IALS, PIAAC, ALL)including the use of Item Response Theory (IRT), test design frameworks and sometest items.LAMP adopts a psychometrically derived notion of a continuum of literacy andnumeracy abilities presented as three ‘levels’ of performance across ‘domains’ ofprose, document and numeracy (i.e. three common scales). The Mongolian assessmentinvolved a randomised sample of 4000 respondents. The ﬁrst full round of assessmenttook place in Mongolia, Jordan, Palestine and Paraguay. These countries are linkedmethodologically through processes of test item development, statistical proceduressuch as calibration and weighting, and ultimately through common reporting and com-parison. They are also linked in networks and alliances, involving ﬂows of materials(including test items), expertise and resources. These networked actors and institutionsComparative Education 3Downloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 can be viewed not only as technical experts, but also what Ball (2010) calls ‘policyentrepreneurs’. Such networked expertise is vital in processes of methodological inno-vation, learning and problem solving – to deal with the challenges associated with themovement, translation and comparison of assessment items across culturally and lin-guistically diverse contexts.I observed the national literacy assessment in Mongolia, and conducted informalinterviews with respondents and testers, and detailed ethnographic observations ofassessment events. I travelled and lived with assessment teams – as an anthropologistamong the psychometricians. The assessment events described in the paper took placein the Gobi desert in the province of Dornogovi. The desert is sparsely populated andhome to nomadic pastoralists who herd camels, horses, goats, sheep and cows. Thenomads are resilient and capable, making their living in a harsh desert environment.There are few roads outside the provincial centre, only tracks in the sand, and the land-scape is marked with rolling dunes and the occasional mining complex.The assessments took place in people’s homes (whether conventional houses inurban centres or in gers – the traditional, round, felt covered nomadic homes). Urbanand nomadic homes are often one room constructions. That imposes certain dynamicson the testing situation. The Gobi desert is bitterly cold in November, so the testingteam, the respondent and their family, including babies and young children, the localguide and driver, interpreter and the author were frequently present during assessmentevents. The adults would usually be offered tea and milk-based snacks while the assess-ment took place. It proved to be a very useful context to study standardised literacyassessment.Mongolian people normally welcomed the LAMP assessment team, and were inter-ested in the assessment tasks. The respondents were generally conﬁdent to ask ques-tions and to make evaluative comments about the assessment. They sometimesprovided running commentaries as uninvited ‘think aloud’ protocols. It was instructiveto observe how respondents attempted to involve other people – the tester and familymembers to help them to complete the assessment task – asking for guidance, checkingout the ground rules of the assessment. That interactive aspect was to some extent afeature of all the assessment events. However, in some cases attempts to involveothers breached the norms of ‘good practice’ that are intended to isolate the respondentfrom others who might provide assistance (i.e. it is supposed to be an individual assess-ment). The following example of ‘unruly’ behaviour is an extreme case of a widerphenomenon – the signiﬁcance of social interaction in assessment events.The ethnography of assessment eventsThis ethnographic account of an assessment event with a middle aged, educated manwas conducted in his home. A background questionnaire was completed, and thechoice of respondent took place by randomised selection. The assessment took placein an open plan room consisting of a sitting area at one end (with settee, chairs and tele-vision) and an attached kitchen.There were four of the testing team present – the tester (T), myself, interpreter and avisitor from UNESCO. Of the respondent’s (R) family, his wife (W) and teenagedaughter (D) were present, and later in the assessment his son (S) arrived. The testersat on a stool opposite the respondent at a low table. R’s wife and daughter movedduring the interview between the kitchen area and the sitting area. I sat on the setteeobserving the event with the interpreter and the visitor from UNESCO.4 B. MaddoxDownloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 This ‘assemblage’ of actors contrasts with the individualistic, cognitive construct ofliteracy that informs psychometric assessment design. The assessment events did notinvolve isolated, disembodied individuals. They were embodied social actors withstatus, emotional lives and agency. For ease of analysis the transcript is presented insections. The transcript was produced through simultaneous translation and notetaking. In that sense the transcript is incomplete as it does not capture details familiarto sociolinguistic transcription – such as tone, the nuances of the Mongolian languageor overlapping speech. We join the event where the respondent is presented with theﬁrst of the testing booklets:R: Whoah! They’re asking me to do this stuff!W: Don’t make the booklet dirty.R: Well then, ask my daughter to do it.T: She can’t do it, she wasn’t selected.At this point R’s wife (W) and daughter (D) come from the kitchen area to help and tolend moral support. The interviewer says that they can’t help.R: They can’t help? Oh damn it!The respondent’s wife and daughter nevertheless read the document instructions withthe respondent, and begin to read the questions out loud for the ﬁrst assessment item.T: The important thing is that you can’t help him. Don’t be stressed, it’s for the Mongoliangovernment, for the national literacy assessment, it will be conﬁdential. Nobody willhave access to the information.R: What is this? How am I supposed to do this kind of stuff?This opening section of the assessment event contains many of the characteristics ofother assessments observed – involving the interactive co-construction of the eventand negotiation of the ‘rules of engagement’. In this case there is a rapid emotionalresponse to the assessment tasks and a process of negotiation where the tester estab-lishes the individual orientation of the assessment tasks. The respondent is clearlynot keen to undertake the assessment. The tester asserts the rationale of randomisedselection: ‘She can’t do it, she was not selected’. Then, as the respondent’s wife anddaughter come to offer help and emotional support, the tester again attempts to establishand enforce the rules of the assessment by use of a ‘scale jump’ (Blommaert 2008) thatlocates the event within a wider national context and, by association, obligations of citi-zenship: ‘Don’t be stressed, it’s for the Mongolian government, for the national literacyassessment, it will be conﬁdential’.This is an ideal moment to reﬂect on the way that social context shapes the assess-ment event. The history of state power in Mongolia, particularly in the former commu-nist period, and the uncertainties of life in the contemporary ‘market’ era mean that therespondents have reasons to be cautious in their interactions with the State. The longand often repressive regimes of the communist era (1921–1990) imposed powerfulobligations of nationality and citizenship where non-compliance with requests fromgovernment had severe implications. Now, in what is referred to as the ‘age of themarket’ (Sneath 2002), people have less reason to be wary of state power, butremain reliant on the good will of social networks including those of the district(‘sum’) administration for access to goods and services (Empson 2011; SneathComparative Education 5Downloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 2002). As Empson (2011) argues ‘The Mongolian government still retains enormousdecision-making powers over the district, its people and resources’ (24). Furthermore,in the Mongolian Gobi, there are strong obligations toward hospitality, and any overtexpressions of displeasure in encounters with visitors are thought to be inappropriateand risky (Humphrey 2012). The obligations to others (in this case to representativesof the State conducting a literacy assessment), may be viewed within the culturalnotion of ‘harnessing fortune’ (‘hishig, hurtech’), which Empson (2011) describes tomean ‘grace, favour, beneﬁt, fortune’ (14). This helps to explain the outcome of theinitial period of negotiation of the respondent’s participation, why he is formally ‘reas-sured’ by the tester’s comments. Returning to the assessment event, the interviewer hasjust explained about the procedures for answering the questions, and about the relation-ship between the comprehension texts and the associated questions. The respondent (R)looks through the booklet, and smiles nervously. Then he calls his wife:R: Hey! I don’t understand this question. What is this word – ‘foundation’?T: You can’t help [speaking to his wife]. You [the respondent] have to look for the infor-mation in the text.R: How am I supposed to know?T: All the information related to the question is in the text. It is not testing your knowl-edge, just trying to look at your literacy.The interaction between the respondent, his family and the tester is illuminating. Here,he raises one of the fundamentally important questions about the assessment process –that is, the relationship between textual and contextual knowledge. The tester attemptsto establish the principle that the text is the primary source of information. As we willsee later, the assessment process expects the respondent to privilege textual contentover contextual knowledge. Secondly, the tester is establishing a position about theconstruct in the assessment: that ‘literacy’ can be reduced to an isolated (and individua-lised) text-based act, disentangled from wider processes of knowledge production andinterpretation.T: Nobody other than you can help to answer the question. If you feel that you can’t do it,you can skip it. The information is on the left and the question on the right. You shouldlook carefully and ﬁnd the answer in the text.R: Can I put any number?W: Just put 40! [she calls from the kitchen area]The respondent’s daughter comes in from the kitchen area and explains the task to herfather. The respondent asks:R: Is it real? Is the foundation really in Mongolia?T: No – it’s not real. It’s just for the assessment. You have to look to ﬁnd the answer.What we see in the section above is a clear process of negotiation about rules and pro-cedures. But there is something else. The respondent is exploring an ontological ques-tion about the status of the text – i.e. ‘is it real?’. In this case, the tester responds that it is‘not real’ (implying that the text is a genre of realistic ﬁction). However, the content ofthe text is serious and realistic in nature. The ability to distinguish between ‘real life’information and inferences drawn from real life about hypothetical content is one ofthe more nuanced aspects of the assessment tasks. We will return to the question ofwhat’s real later in the paper.6 B. MaddoxDownloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 ‘Sister, you can’t help him’The ‘unruly’ behaviour of the respondent and his family are a challenge to the integrityof the assessment event and the procedural requirements of good practice. The respon-dent’s family want to help and indeed, the respondent expects them to help. So ratherthan a ‘focal event’ (Goodwin and Duranti 1992, 11) involving the respondent and theassessment text, what we have is a collective event, in which the respondent and theassessment text is the focus of attention. The tester has been co-opted as a resourcefor the respondent – where questions can be asked about rules and boundaries, ques-tions of clariﬁcation and strategy.The respondent’s daughter is now leaning over her father’s shoulder, reading thetasks with him. The respondent’s daughter asks the tester for clariﬁcation:D: Does he count the number or the percentage?R: It’s talking about honey or something.T: Well, the information is in the text. It’s easy to ﬁnd the answer.D: I don’t think it is honey, I think it is oil. [she whispers help]The assessment continues in that style with the daughter providing help and asking thetester questions about the test items.D: Can he write it down here? [she asks the tester]T: Sister – you can’t help him! Why not go and watch TV.R: Daughter! Come here.R: What is this?As the assessment continues the respondent’s daughter and wife are increasinglyinvolved.D: You should calculate 10%, and half of that, then add to get 15%. You should get 10%,and then 5%, and then deduct it from the price.T: Hey! You should not help him.R: This is my ﬁrst day of leave, and I have to do this difﬁcult task!R: Is this correct?D: No!R: Why?D: Because you are using the wrong numbers.R: What the hell is this? Daughter – come here!T: You can’t call her – she is not supposed to help.The daughter does come to help – and the man’s wife also joins them. It is a touchingexample of support for a family member. The daughter is openly going against the gui-dance provided by the tester.R: This is such a stupid question.T: Sister, I told you. You can’t help.R: Why is this survey coming to my house?T: It’s randomly selected.As this conversation takes place, the respondent’s wife joins them and leans over tosupport him, whispering the answer to a question. The man is clearly stressed by thetask. He uses phrases including: ‘These questions are really confusing’; ‘boy, this issuch a pain!’; and ‘I’m being killed, and I have no help’. But he does have help.Comparative Education 7Downloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 The man’s wife and daughter stay with him (either leaning on him or standing close by),and provide help and emotional support. In many of the assessment events familymembers took up the same physical stance, leaning over the respondent to read theassessment booklet to provide moral support. They did not always provide theanswers. In this case, despite the tester’s best efforts, there does not seem to be away to exclude the family members from the process.The man’s son returns home and asks what’s going on.R: Your sister is not helping me. [to his son, who joins him and leans over to read thequestion]S: The answer is right there. [he points to the text]Then later in the assessment:D: You see, I am helping you. You said that I was not helping!The social in contextWhat can be learned from this episode? It’s clear from the transcript that the tester triedbut failed to prevent the family members from collaborating in the assessment event.Should that simply be attributed to ‘bad practice’ in testing, or the behaviour ofunruly people? To answer that question the following exchange after the assessmentbetween the respondent and tester is quite revealing:R: That was a heavy exam!R: Couldn’t I get help? Sometimes I do.T: No, you’re not supposed to.This provides an insight into how the respondent and tester viewed the assessmentevent and the collective nature of everyday literacy practices. That is (a) the respondentacknowledges that he gets help with literacy, i.e. ‘sometimes I do’, and (b) that the testerrefers to an external source of authority or standards in the assessment ‘you’re not sup-posed to’. The ﬁrst statement relates to the realm of everyday life, while the secondrefers to the attempt by the assessment regime to construct a competing context forthe assessment.The transcript illustrates the dissonance produced as the participants contest com-peting constructs of literacy. The testing situation is based on a construct of literacyabilities that are cognitive attributes of an isolated individual. Therefore, the respon-dent’s acknowledgement that he sometimes receives help with literacy appears toshow that his functional literacy abilities are lacking.Another way to look at the event is that the respondent has been able to complete theassessment tasks with the help of others. That explanation seems entirely inappropriatefrom the perspective of an assessment regime and the educational construct of individ-ual competence. However, it is one way to understand the behaviour of the respondentand his family. Anthropological studies of literacy describe its inherently social char-acter. They suggest an alternative construct based on a situated model of literacy andcognition. That perspective is supported by Goodwin’s ‘participation framework’:A primordial site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists of asituation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry out courses of action inconcert with each other through talk while attending to both the larger activities inwhich their current actions are embedded and relevant phenomena in the world aroundthem. (Goodwin 2002, 22)8 B. MaddoxDownloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 Goodwin’s framework seems apt. The literacy assessment event is fundamentally inter-active and the participants are attentive to multiple sources of information that arepresent in the event and outside the event, some of which are textually based, andothers that relate to the ‘wider world around them’.Context and affectThe ethnography of literacy assessment events reveals content about social interactionsand emotional affect that may inﬂuence the outcomes of assessment, and that are notusually captured in statistical assessment data. That includes levels of stress, pleasure,fatigue and motivation. Some respondents were distracted by other things going on intheir lives such as prior appointments or the arrival of visitors. In those cases they some-times skipped questions and rushed the assessment tasks. The verbal responses ofrespondents capture this kind of detail. For example, the respondent below was dueto take her baby for a health appointment later that day:I want to do this fast. I’m busy in the afternoon. I have to fetch water. I don’t have muchtime.Most of the respondents showed a high level of concentration and commitment to theassessment. They put other activities on hold and asked others to prepare food, to lookafter babies and children, and said that other demands such as looking after animalswould have to wait. The following excerpt from an assessment with a nomadicherder illustrates this point:R: These graphics are confusing.Outside some visitors are arriving to look at horses that the respondent intended to sell.Visitor: It’s getting dark.T: number the answers to make them clear.[The respondent smiles, and concentrates on the task. There is movement ofanimals outside. A visitor comes in, pours himself some tea and lights a pipe.]T: If you think it is difﬁcult you can skip the question.[He does not skip the question and is really concentrating on the task. Threeherders are now sitting watching the assessment event. A fourth herder enters]Visitor: The horses are coming in.R: Okay. You go for the cows.In that example the respondent is attentive to the assessment task while life goes onaround him.These examples provide insights into how the assessment event is co-constructed byhuman and non-human actors, and how the respondent deals with their competingdemands and expectations. The second part of the paper develops this further toexamine how the respondents tackle test items.This is not a camelThe international character of large-scale assessment programmes highlights the chal-lenge of maintaining cross-cultural validity, and associated questions of test item adap-tation, relevance and comparability. In the second part of this paper two contrasting testitems are examined to see how they were received by respondents in the MongolianComparative Education 9Downloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 Gobi. The test item content was informed by a methodological framework that pro-moted the use of ‘realistic’ materials, while maintaining cross-cultural validity(Kirsch 2001).The Mongolian camel test item was initially developed by the Mongolian LAMPteam. The test item provides an image of a Bactrian camel followed by some descriptivetext about camels in Mongolia. It has three questions and the answers can ideally all beobtained from the descriptive text without the need for local knowledge. The Gobi is thehome of the Mongolian camel, and the people there are experts on camels, so it wasinstructive to see how they responded to ‘realistic’ test item content.The test item proved to be very popular with the Mongolian respondents. They fre-quently identiﬁed the test item as one of the most enjoyable of the assessment. Thesequestions clearly produced a positive emotional affect.One might anticipate that local knowledge would enable people who own Mongo-lian camels to perform well on this test item (perhaps better than others taking theassessment outside Mongolia). However, this was not always the case. Indeed, in stat-istical terms, Mongolia’s respondents were no more likely to obtain the correct answerthan respondents from other countries. To explain this, we need to consider Bernstein’s(1996) concepts of educational framing and re-contextualisation. We can safely assumethat nomads in the Mongolian Gobi are experts on Mongolian camels. However, toparaphrase the artist Magritte, ‘this is not a camel’, rather it is a representation of acamel, positioned within the particular requirements of a performance-oriented testitem. As non-experts in Mongolian camels we have limited knowledge resources tohelp us to answer the question. In contrast, the Mongolian herders have extensiveand nuanced knowledge and experience of camels. Within the assessment there is aclearly demarcated sense of legitimate knowledge and correct answers. Implicit inthe design of the test item is that the respondent should privilege the knowledge thatis available in the text and, by implication, to relegate their intimate knowledge ofcamels to secondary importance. The question clearly points the reader in that direction:Use the article about Mongolia’s Bactrian Camel on the opposite page to answer ques-tions 3 through to 5. (Emphasis mine)The refrain of testers that ‘the answer is in the text’ alerts us to the dominant construct ofliteracy that informs the assessment design. The manual for testers emphasises theimportance of precision to ensure that the wording of the answer matches the contentof the assessment text. The respondent is presented with a dilemma. They are‘invited’ by the familiar topic to use local knowledge to help them to complete thetask. However, what seems local is actually only ‘rendered local’ (Latour 1996). Asan assessment item it is a global camel – one that has travelled fromMongolia, attendedglobal meetings on literacy assessment, and then, having been framed within the assess-ment text, is re-introduced into a Mongolian setting. The analogy with Mongolia’s pol-itical history is not without a sense of irony. Knowledge of camels arguably operates asa ‘nuisance dimension’. This can be illustrated with a second transcript below.The following account of assessment was conducted with a woman nomadic herder(R) in the Gobi. She had been reluctant to take the assessment and openly questioned itsvalue. She had previously been visited by a team conducting a survey about childlabour and asked if this assessment was part of that project. The tester (T) had per-suaded her to take part, saying that we had travelled a long way across the desert tobe there. It was cold, late in the day, and the sun was going down. Unlike most of10 B. MaddoxDownloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 the respondents, the women complained about the assessment and some of the ques-tions in the background questionnaire. When asked about her household possessionsshe replied:R: What are you talking about? Are you crazy? Do you see any stuff like that here? I doeverything with my bare hands!The conditions for the assessment were not good. There was no table, and there was noﬁre. The assessment was completed by the respondent while she stood under a weaklamp. The respondent complained about her eyesight, and held the assessmentbooklet close to her face:R: I can’t read, I’m blind.The respondent complained that the assessment contained ‘a load of shit questions’. Itappeared that she did not appreciate the value of the national literacy assessment.However, she continued (skipping the questions that she could not answer), andwhen she got to the question about the camel she clearly showed an increased interestand motivation.The respondent read the questions slowly and out loud and joked with the tester.Does a camel drink that much? I’m kidding!The respondent answered two of the questions correctly, but provided the answersbefore she had read the descriptive text by using her local knowledge. In the ﬁrsttwo cases her answers corresponded with the information provided in the text.However, for the third question she provided a very detailed answer based on herexpert knowledge of camels. She described in some detail about how camels arepatient about the cold and the heat, how they don’t have to drink every day and howthey can cope with hunger. Her answer did not match the text and was marked asincorrect.Expertise about camels helped the respondent to complete the task (and increasedher enjoyment and motivation), but that did not help her to answer questions basedon obtaining information from the assessment text. Local knowledge about camels inthe Gobi seems to have undermined the rigour of the assessment item. This may bea case of ‘too much context’.The research literature on ‘realistic’ content in assessment reveals how it can unex-pectedly become the source of test item bias. Cooper and Dunne (1998) for example,describe how girls from working class backgrounds are disadvantaged because theycan’t anticipate the educational codes and norms associated with realistic content inmathematics test items, and the ‘educational ground rules’ that enable them toproduce the ‘correct’ answer. They argue that too much realism from the respondentwill produce multiple answers, many of which might sound plausible, but will notproduce the ‘correct’ answer: ‘The child is required to introduce only a small dose ofrealism – “just about enough”’ (120).The question ‘is this real?’ asked by several of the Mongolian respondents duringthe LAMP assessment events is telling. The realistic content of the assessment cancause confusion about the level of realism involved. There were numerous occasionsin the assessment events observed where the participants appeared to struggle overComparative Education 11Downloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 realistic content in the text. In some cases respondents declined to answer questionsbecause they said that they were not familiar with the realistic content.A simple application form for employmentThis second and contrasting example involves a test item requiring applicants to com-plete a realistic application form for employment in a fast food restaurant. The ques-tions ask the respondent to complete part of a form and to indicate their availabilityfor work. The test item is used in LAMP, but was originally developed for the Inter-national Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) for use in OECD countries (OECD 2000) andsome modiﬁcations took place for use in LAMP.1 This is an example of a high stakesassessment since ‘not being able to ﬁll out a simple application form’ is frequentlycited in the media as evidence of poor levels of adult literacy. That illustrates howa sense of deﬁcit and crisis can be developed from literacy assessment data to legit-imise neoliberal policy interventions – framing respondents as potential wagelabourers in need of training.The test item application form is realistic, but the question of ‘how real’ is part of thepuzzle. The form appears to be real and has the design and hallmarks of authenticityassociated with textually mediated institutional encounters. Furthermore, the instruc-tions address the respondent directly as ‘you’. The respondent is therefore invited to‘play’ in a ﬁctional scenario. The respondent must understand that it is not reallythem, but a make believe ‘you’. The assessment text is not supposed to be abouttheir actual life – i.e. it has nothing to do with their actual availability for work. Thecontent is realistic, but deﬁnitively not real (as the tester noted in the earlier transcript).As Bernstein’s (1996) concept of a pedagogic device suggests, the real life content is re-contextualised as an assessment task.In the Mongolian context, the test item clearly illustrates processes of geographicalmovement and re-contextualisation. The test item is based on particular Western experi-ences of markets for employment and culinary traditions.How did the Mongolian respondents manage the application form? In contrast withthe camel question, many of the respondents commented that they found the employ-ment form difﬁcult, and said that they did not understand the task. However, the stat-istical DIF (Differential Item Functioning) analysis did not reveal any problems withthe performance of the item. Difﬁcult items are a necessary feature of literacy assess-ment that uses Item Response Theory (IRT) to reveal the distribution of abilitieswithin the population. However, the sources of difﬁculty matter. In this case itappears that some respondents found it difﬁcult to make sense of the test item, andin doing so they had little experience to draw from:R: What does it mean? I’m not going to answer this question.And another respondent said:R: Should I ﬁll it in with my information?The ethnographic transcripts reveal a semiotic dissonance associated with the ambigu-ously realistic content of the item. They show that respondents were unclear about thenature of the assessment task and as a result they sometimes skipped the test item(which would be marked as ‘incorrect’).12 B. MaddoxDownloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 R: How do you know what the answer should be?T: The answer is given in the information.R: What does this sentence mean?T: This is about the distance from the house to the work. Not your actual work, it’s theinformation in the text. Not real life.The fast food test item appears to promote a neoliberal social imaginary, framingnomadic herders as potential restaurant employees.2 The irony in this case is thatfor many respondents in rural areas, the ‘realistic’ content is unfamiliar. Fast food res-taurants are not a feature of the Mongolian Gobi and the depiction of the formal labourmarket was alien to many respondents. Nomads in the Gobi make a living fromherding animals in a harsh environment. Where opportunities exist some nomadicfamilies do take paid employment (Humphrey and Sneath 1999; Sneath 2002). Inthe Gobi area those opportunities include work in the rapidly expanding mining indus-try. A few of the younger respondents commented that they had recently completedapplication forms for work in the mining sector. However, others commented onthe difﬁculty of the test item, saying that they were not familiar with applicationforms and had never applied for employment. This example is a case of ‘notenough context’. For this test item the ethnographic transcripts suggest that testitem difﬁculty is associated with test item movement and re-contextualisation –how respondents received and made sense of its unfamiliar context.ConclusionThe global scale of educational assessment programmes is said to offer powerful com-parative insights into educational achievements. However, the forces that drive globa-lisation in assessment (i.e. the desire for international comparison) are not necessarilysensitive to the difﬁculties that are created when test items travel. The movement andre-contextualisation of test items across radically different cultural and linguistic con-texts presents formidable challenges to the validity of international assessments.This paper has sought to investigate those dynamics with an ethnographicaccount of standardised adult literacy assessment Mongolia. It introduced the‘assessment event’ as a focal feature of ethnographic analysis, and its scope toinform the analysis of test item performance. The paper used the concepts of ‘irre-ducibility’ and ‘assemblage’ from Actor Network Theory (ANT) to examine howapparently standardised assessment events display unruly and idiosyncratic charac-teristics. These are the result of multiple factors (often neglected in statistical analy-sis) – such as the agency and behaviour of actors, emotional affect, sources ofmotivation and obligation, and the relationship between textual and contextualknowledge. The use of ANT in this paper has illustrated how non-human actors(including technical framework documents and test item booklets) shape assessmentencounters and help to transmit global and neoliberal agendas. Nevertheless, socialreproduction cannot simply be read off from the content of test items. The transcriptsof assessment events demonstrate the ANT principle of ‘irreducibility’, as the assem-blage of human and non-human actors produces its own dynamics in local–globalencounters.The opening ethnographic account of an ‘unruly’ literacy assessment drew on thework of Goodwin to show how assessment events are co-constructed through embodiedsocial interaction, and its spatial, temporal and affective dimensions. The context of theComparative Education 13Downloaded by [University of East Anglia Library] at 07:32 03 April 2014 event is extended to include interactions between the tester, the respondent, the assess-ment text and others present – such as family members. The inclusion of small-scaleethnographic analysis provides insights into how respondents make sense of the assess-ment, and helps to identify unexpected sources of difﬁculty that were not intended inthe assessment design. In the opening example, that includes difﬁculty associatedwith the ‘realistic’ content of the test items, and the associated anxiety with the onto-logical question ‘is it real?’.The theme of realistic test item content was explored further in the second part of thepaper. ‘Mongolia’s Bactrian Camel’ and the ‘Employment Application’ highlight someof the challenges associated with ‘realistic’ test item content, cross-cultural validity andadaptation. Those test items represent contrasting aspects of contemporary Mongoliansociety: traditional herding and the rapid changes to labour markets associated withresource extraction.The test item on the Mongolian camel described the problems that nomadic herdersfaced in dealing with the dissonance between realistic textual knowledge and their ownexpertise in camel herding. It revealed how the assessment design privileges writteninformation in assessment texts over local knowledge. The local content increasedpeople’s motivation and interest in the questions. However, one could argue that thetest item was ‘too real’, since local knowledge acted as an unexpected distractor.Thus people who are less familiar with camels or the geography of Mongolia mighthave been more likely to obtain their answers from the textual information.The fast food employment application form highlights a contrasting aspect of Mon-golian society linked with globalisation. In this case, the realistic content was ‘not realenough’. Fast food restaurants are not currently a feature of life in the Mongolian Gobi.Nor are people experienced in dealing with textually mediated access to labour markets,though this may change rapidly with the expanding economy. The test item is abouthow people engage with the political economy and the changing political ecology ofliteracy.Notes1. Lennon, ETS personal communication, May 2012.2.
