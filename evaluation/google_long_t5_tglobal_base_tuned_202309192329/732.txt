ABSTRACT: 
© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. Stomatal conductance (g s) is a key land-surface attribute as it links transpiration, the dominant component of global land evapotranspiration, and photosynthesis, the driving force of the global carbon cycle. Despite the pivotal role of g s in predictions of global water and carbon cycle changes, a global-scale database and an associated globally applicable model of g s that allow predictions of stomatal behaviour are lacking. Here, we present a database of globally distributed g s obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) and biomes. We find that stomatal behaviour differs among PFTs according to their marginal carbon cost of water use, as predicted by the theory underpinning the optimal stomatal model and the leaf and wood economics spectrum. We also demonstrate a global relationship with climate. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of g s across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, continental and global-scale modelling of ecosystem productivity, energy balance and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate. 
 
PREDICTION: 
Stomatal conductance is a key land surface attribute as it links plant water-use and carbon uptake. In this study we synthesised a globally distributed database of stomatal conductance data sets obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) and biomes. We employed a model of optimal stomatal conductance to assess differences in stomatal behaviour. We estimated the model slope coefficient, g1, which is directly related to the marginal carbon cost of water-use, for each dataset. We then tested how g1 varies with climatic factors, including temperature and water availability, and across PFTs. We found that g1 varied considerably among PFTs, with evergreen savanna trees having a largest g1 (least conservative water-use), followed by C3 grasses and crops, angiosperm trees, gymnosperm trees, and C4 grasses. Amongst angiosperm trees, species with larger wood density had a larger marginal carbon cost of water-use, as predicted by the theory underpinning the optimal stomatal model. There was an interactive effect between temperature and moisture availability (on g1: for wet environments, g1 was largest in high temperature environments, indicated by high mean annual growing degree days above 0oC 90 (mGDD0), but it did not vary with mGDD0 across dry environments. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of stomatal conductance across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, continental and global-scale modelling of productivity and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate.

In this study we synthesised a globally distributed database of stomatal 78 conductance data sets obtained in the field for a wide range of plant functional types (PFTs) 79 and biomes. We employed a model of optimal stomatal conductance1 to assess differences 80 in stomatal behaviour. We estimated the model slope coefficient, g1, which is directly 81 related to the marginal carbon cost of water-use, for each dataset. We then tested how g1 82 varies with climatic factors, including temperature and water availability, and across PFTs. 83 We found that g1 varied considerably among PFTs, with evergreen savanna trees having 84 the largest g1 (least conservative water-use), followed by C3 grasses and crops, angiosperm 85 trees, gymnosperm trees, and C4 grasses. Amongst angiosperm trees, species with larger 86 wood density had a larger marginal carbon cost of water-use, as predicted by the theory 87 underpinning the optimal stomatal model. There was an interactive effect between 88 temperature and moisture availability (on g1: for wet environments, g1 was largest in high 89 temperature environments, indicated by high mean annual growing degree days above 0oC 90 (mGDD0), but it did not vary with mGDD0 across dry environments. These findings 91 provide a robust theoretical framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of 92 stomatal conductance across biomes and across PFTs that can be applied to regional, 93 continental and global-scale modelling of productivity and ecohydrological processes in a 94 future changing climate. 95 96 Earth System Models (ESMs) integrate biogeochemical and biogeophysical land surface 97 processes with physical climate models and have been widely used to demonstrate the 98 importance of land surface processes in determining climate and to highlight the issue of 99 large uncertainties in quatifying land surface processes2, 3, 4, 5. Within the biogeophysical 100 5 components of land surface processes, stomatal conductance plays a pivotal role because it 101 is a key feedback route for carbon and water exchange between the atmosphere and 102 terrestial vegetation. Stomata are small pores on leaves whose behaviour can be regulated 103 by the plant in response to multiple abiotic and biotic factors. Stomatal conductance (gs) is 104 a major determinant of both transpiration rates and rates of photosynthetic C uptake. . 105 Therefore, our ability to model the global carbon and water cycles under future changing 106 climate depends on our ability to predict stomatal behaviour globally1, an ability that to-107 date has remained particularly intractactable . Although there have been previous synthesis 108 studies on plant stomatal conductance and related traits6, 7, 8, 9, a global scale database and 109 associated mechanistic globally applicable model of gs that would allow prediction of 110 stomatal behaviour is lacking. 111 112 For this study, we compiled a unique global database of field measurements of stomatal 113 conductance and photosynthesis suitable for extracting model parameters. We employed a 114 model of optimal stomatal conductance1 to develop hypotheses for how stomatal behaviour 115 should vary with environmental factors and with plant traits associated with hydraulic 116 function. In the optimal stomatal model, the slope parameter, g1, is proportional to the 117 marginal carbon cost of water-use1, meaning that plants with smaller g1 values are more 118 conservative with their water-use and have higher water-use-efficiency (and vice versa). 119 Therefore, we hypothesised that variation in g1 values among climate zones and PFTs 120 should reflect differences in the cost of water transport. We proposed that: 121 (1) g1 values among PFTs should vary according to the cost of stemwood construction, 122 such that C3 herbaceous species should have the largest g1 (i.e. least conservative water-123 use), followed by angiosperm trees and gymnosperm trees. Since the optimal stomatal 124 6 theory predicts that, for the same marginal water cost, g1 should be lower by approximately 125 one-half 10. We therefore predicted that C4 plants would have the smallest g1. 126 (2) For trees, the cost of water transport should increase with wood density, due to the 127 higher cost of wood construction11 and the generally smaller hydraulic conductance of 128 sapwoos with large density. Therefore within both angiosperms and gymnosprems, trees 129 with highest wood density should have the smallest g1. 130 (3) Moisture stress should increase the cost of water-use to the plant, so plants in dry 131 environments should have a larger marginal cost of water-use and lower g1. 132 (4) g1 values should increase with temperature for two reasons. First, we previously 133 showed that g1 is approximately proportional to a combination term of the carbon cost of 134 water transport and (the CO2 compensation point in absence of photorespiration)1. As 135 is exponentially dependent on temperature1, 12, g1 should similarly increase with 136 temperature. Second, the viscosity of water decreases with increasing temperature, making 137 it less costly to transport water leading to a increased g113. 138 139 To test these hypotheses, we collated a globally distributed database of gs and 140 photosynthesis of 56 field studies, covering a wide range of biomes from Arctic tundra, 141 boreal and temperate forest to tropical rainforest (Table S1). We estimated the model 142 coefficient, g1, from observations of leaf-level gas exchange (gs , ratesd of transpiration 143 and net photosynthesis , see Methods) and environmental drivers. We used mean annual 144 degree days above 0◦C (mGDD0) and moisture index (MI) derived from observed long-145 term meteorological data as proxies to quantify the temperature and water availability that 146 are relevant to plant physiological functions for each site14. The growing degree days 147 above 0◦C is an index of the energy available for completion of the annual life cycle and 148 quantifies temperature limitations to carbon assimilation and growth15, 16. Our database 149 7 covered a range of mGDD0 from 2.7 to 29.7 oC and a range of MI from 0.17 to 3.26, 150 representing the majority of the climatic space for vegetation covered land surfaces (Fig. 151 1). We then tested how g1 varies with MI and mGDD0 across PFTs and biomes?. 152 153 We found a clear pattern of g1 variation among different PFTs with evergreen savanna 154 trees having largest g1, followed by C3 grasses and crops, angiosperm trees, gymnosperm 155 trees, and C4 grasses (Table S2 and Fig. 2). For angiosperm trees, g1 was negatively 156 correlated with wood density, although we did not find any correlation for gymnosperm 157 species (Fig. 3). g1 significantly increased with both increasing mGDD0 and MI across the 158 entire data set. However, when evaluated as a bivariate relationship (Fig. 2c-d, and Fig. 4a-159 b) we observed that there was an interactive effect between temperature and moisture 160 availability on g1: for wet environments, g1 was largest at sites with high mGDD0, but it 161 varied with mGDD0 to a much smaller degree across dry environments (Table 1 and Fig. 162 4). 163 Our results largely supported our hypotheses for how g1 should vary among PFTs 164 (hypothesis 1) and biomes. The variation in g1 among PFTs is a result of trade-offs among 165 plant functions such as growth, defence and reproduction, through different resource 166 allocation patterns that aim to achieve the optimal cost-to-benefit ratios8, 13 Long life-span 167 PFTs, such as evergreen gymnosperm and angiosperm trees, must invest more in building 168 supporting and defence structures relative to short life-span PFTs, such as grasses, so that 169 they can be sustained over many years of biotic and abiotic stress. Such an investment 170 preference has to come at the cost of reduced growth rates17, 18, meaning reduced the rates 171 of carbon uptake and water loss cost through opening stomata. Therefore we predicted a 172 more conservative water-use strategy in trees (lower g1) than in C3 grass (higher g1), and 173 this was observed in the database. However, evergreen savanna trees formed an exception 174 8 with a surprisingly large g1, relative to expectations based upon trees wood density and 175 biomes MI. This may result from the fact that these species have several unique hydraulic 176 functional traits that may offset the carbon cost of water-use which allow them to have a 177 less conservative water use strategy. These hydraulic functional traits include: deep roots 178 to access groundwater, large sapwood area for water transport, narrow but long conduits to 179 reduce the risk of embolism and reduce the cost of conduit wall construction19, 20 and dry 180 season declines in LAI to balance increased atmospheric aridity in the dry season . This 181 special case of evergreen savanna trees is worthy of further investigation. 182 183 We found a significant relationship between g1 and wood density among angiosperm trees 184 (Fig. 3; excluding savanna angiosperms) which supported our hypothesis that g1 is 185 negatively correlated with wood density (hypothesis 2). A larger wood density is 186 advantagous for plants that need to avoid hydraulic failure so that they can sustain more 187 negative sapwood water pressures during drought18. However, such an investment is at the 188 expense of a reduced capacity for stem water storage, reduced sapwood conductivity and 189 the carbon cost of building wood with higher density20, 21, 22, and thus leads to a more 190 conservative water-use-strategy. However, we did not find such a relationship among 191 gymnosperm trees. This lack of correlation may be due to the limited variability in wood 192 density in gymnosperms. There are significant differences in the anatomical structure of 193 sapwood between angiosperms and gymnosperms. The majority of angiosperm trees have 194 evolved to separate the water transport structure (i.e. vessels) from the mechanical support 195 structure, while gymnosperm trees do not have such a functional differentiation, as 196 tracheids are used for both water transport and mechanical support18, 23. Therefore, wood 197 density is a good proxy for quantifying the trade-offs between transport and support 198 investments for angiosperm trees but not for gymnosperm trees23. The distinct differences 199 9 in the water-use strategy between angiosperm trees and gymnosperm trees (Fig. 2) is 200 consistent with a recent observation that angiosperms maintain a much smaller hydraulic 201 safety margin than gymnosperms24, showing that angiosperms allow some loss of 202 hydraulic conductivity – a risky strategy – while gymnosperms minimise lossThis 203 evolutionary development confers an advantage to angiosperm trees by allowing them to 204 use water in a less conservative way, thereby increasing their carbon gain relative to 205 gymnosperm trees. 206 207 Our results only partially supported our hypotheses for how g1 should vary with moisture 208 stress and temperature (hypotheses 3 and 4 as there was an interactive effect between 209 temperature and moisture stress on g1. This interactive response between MI and mGDD0 210 demonstrates the complexity of how plants co-ordinate their resource allocation strategies 211 along two axes of climatic gradient (Fig. 4). Temperature affects the cost of water transport 212 in such a way that it should be more costly to transport water in a colder environment than 213 in a warmer one. However, lower temperature also comes with water savings as the 214 evaporative demand and photorespiratory cost are lower. The interactive relationship 215 between MI and mGDD0 suggest that the rate of change in g1 (i.e. the slope of each 216 exponential curve; Fig. S3) along temperature or water availibility gradient is much higher 217 in the wet and warm environments than in dry and cold environments. 218 219 Our study demonstrated the first mechanistically robust framework that can be applied to 220 various scales for understanding and predicting the behaviour of stomatal conductance 221 across biomes and across PFTs. We analysed a global stomatal behaviour data set along 222 two major climatic axes, providing an analytic framework for understanding how 223 stomatal behaviour adapts to the environment. Our findings will allow the ESM 224 10 community to move on from using empirical stomatal models (ref ref) with tuned 225 parameters to using a more robust, theory-derived optimal stomatal model with meaningful 226 parameters. In addition, we provide a valuable stomatal behaviour database that can be 227 used to parameterise gs among PFTs and which can be applied directly within ESMs for 228 modelling productivity and ecohydrological processes in a future changing climate across 229 regional, continental and global scales. 230 231 232 11 Methods 233 Source of data 234 We synthesised published and unpublished leaf gas exchange data sets for a wide range of 235 PFTs and biomes (Table S1). Our database covers 314 species from 56 experiment sites 236 around the world with 17 sites from Australasia, 15 sites from Europe, 14 sites from North 237 America, six sites from Asia, three sites from South America and one site from Africa. Site 238 latitudes range from 42.9oS to 72.3oN although the majority of the sites are within the 239 temperate zone (n=35; latitude range between 23.5o to 55o and between -23.5o and -55o), 240 followed by tropical zone (n=14; latitude range between -23.5o and 23.5o), boreal zone 241 (n=6; latitude range between 55o and 66.5o) and Arctic zone (n=1; latitude range above 242 66.5o). We used MI and mGDD0 derived from Climate Research Unit data (CRU TS3.1)25 243 from 1991 to 2010 using a modified version of the STASH model26 at a grid resolution of 244 0.5o. In this derivation, mGDD0 was calculated as the ratio of the annual sum of 245 temperatures above 0oC (growing degree days) to the length of the period with 246 temperatures above 0oC; MI was calculated as the ratio of mean annual precipitation to the 247 equilibrium evapo-transpiration (Eeq). We estimated Eeq from temperature and net radiation 248 (calculated from monthly mean percentage of cloud cover) based on the Priestley-Taylor 249 equation26. The Sea-WiFS fAPAR (fraction absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) 250 product was used to determine areas with green vegetation cover at a grid resolution of 0.5o. 251 The wood density data were obtained from the Global Wood Density Database23, 27. 252 253 Data analysis 254 We used data points measured at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) > 0 µmol 255 m-2 s-1, and only data collected from the top third of the canopy (what would happen if you 256 used data for PAR> 250 µmol m-2 s-1 rather than > 0? . Data points with negative 257 12 photosynthesis rates were excluded. In all cases, species were grown under ambient 258 environmental conditions and were not subjected to any treatments, such as elevated CO2, 259 temperature, or drought treatments. We employed an optimal stomatal model1 as: 260 √ where D is vapour pressure deficit, A is net photosynthesis rate, Ca is CO2 concentrtion at 261 leaf surface, and g0, g1 are model coefficients for intercept and slope. We used a non-linear 262 mixed-effect model to estimate the model slope coefficient, g1, for each group separately 263 for various classification schemes as shown in Fig. 2. In all g1 estimations, we assumed the 264 intercept coefficient, g0, to be zero to avoid strong correlation between g0 and g1 which 265 would mask any interesting variation in g1. In this model, individual species were assumed 266 to be the random effect to account for the differences in the g1 slope among species within 267 the same group. To test how g1 varies with climatic variables (i.e. MI and mGDD0), we 268 first estimated g1 for each species using non-linear regression. We then used a linear 269 mixed-effect model to test the relationship between g1, MI and mGDD0. We fitted the 270 model as: 271 assuming PFTs as the random effect to account for the differences in intercept among PFTs. 272 To evaluate the goodness of fit for linear mix-effect model, we calculated both the 273 marginal R2 to quantify the proportion of variance explained by the fixed factors alone and 274 the conditional R2 to quantify the proportion of variance explained by both the fixed and 275 random factors as described in Nakagawa and Holger Schielzeth (2013)28. The relationship 276 between g1 and wood density were tested with a simple linear regression model. All model 277 estimations and statistical analyses were performed within R 3.1.029. 278 13 References 279 1. Medlyn BE, et al.

Coloured 402 circles represent climatic space for the database, with different colours indicating different 403 plant functional types. Grey hexagons represent global climatic space for which vegetation is 404 present. The global climatic space data were binned by every 1 oC for mGDD0 and every 0.25 405 for MI. 406 407 Figure 2: Mean g1 values for plant functional types defined by different classification 408 schemes. Each bar represents mean ± SE. Panels (b) (c) and (d) include C3 species data only. 409 410 Figure 3: Relationship between g1 and wood density for angiosperm and gymnosperm 411 trees. Savanna tree species (all angiosperms) are indicated separately. Each data point 412 represents mean ±SE of g1 for individual species fitted with non-linear regression. A linear 413 regression line was only fitted for angiosperm trees due to limited data for gymnosperm trees. 414 The fitted linear regression relationship between g1 and wood density for angiosperm trees is: 415 g1= -4.77*WD+ 6.96 (P = 0.0008, R2 = 0.23). Wood density data were obtained from Global 416 Wood Density Database23, 27 and are avaible for 45 species in the Stomatal Behaviour Synthesis 417 Database. 418 Figure 4: Estimated and predicted g1 as a function of mGDD0 and MI. Panels (a) (b) show 419 the relationship between estimated g1 and (a) mean annual degree days above 0 oC temperature 420 (mGDD0; oC) and (b) moisture index (MI) at experimental sites among species across different 421 plant functional types (PFTs). Each data point represents mean ± SE of g1 for individual species 422 19 fitted with a non-linear regression. Classification of plant functional types are shown in Figure 423 2e. Panels (c) and (d) are the predicted g1 under different ranges of MI and mGDD0 presented 424 as a partial regression plot. Predictions in (c) and (d) are from linear mixed-effects model for 425 log(g1) assuming PFTs as a random effect to account for the differeces in intercept among PFTs. 426 Colour lines represent the predicted g1 based on fitted model coefficients (Table S3). Colour 427 dots represent the partial regression predictions at a given fixed MI or mGDD0 level. 428 20 Supplementary Materials 429 Table S1: List of data source. 430 Data contributor Location Species Reference Alexandre Bosc Le Bray, France Pinus pinaster Bosc, A.
