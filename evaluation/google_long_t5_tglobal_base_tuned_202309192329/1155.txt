ABSTRACT: 
Responding to financial market disruptions is a defining challenge for policymakers and a central topic of political research. Yet established measures of financial conditions have significant shortcomings. Annual binary crisis variables limit our ability to explore non-linear relationships and the political effects of rapidly changing conditions. Continuous indicators have their own flaws in operationalization and reproducability. We create a continuous measure of real-time perceived stress using a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) of Economist monthly country reports. We demonstrate the usefulness of our measure by showing that it more accurately captures the effect of financial market stress levels on electoral volatility. We also show how KPCA can be used to efficiently summarize large quantities of texts into cross-sectional time-series variables. 
 
PREDICTION: 
Previous research addressing these questions lacks a crucial variable: a continuous indicator of the level of financial market stress that policymakers and voters perceived in real-time. We need a measure of actors’ contemporary perceptions of financial market conditions to understand why they made a given choice and with what effects. Previous binary crisis measures are constructed post hoc, so tend to be biased towards severe crises and away from circumstances where governments effectively responded to emerging trouble. As such, they suffer from clear selection bias. Annual post hoc measures do not necessarily capture conditions as they were perceived at the time of events such as elections. As dichotomous indicators, they neither measure crisis severity nor how it varies over time. They use ad hoc methods to determine when crises have ended. Previous continuous measures of financial markets stress are less common and suffer from other problems. They capture quantities whose importance, measurement, and reporting varies significantly across countries and over time. To overcome these issues, we develop a continuous measure of real-time perceptions off financial market stress using a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) of Economist monthly country reports. We demonstrate the usefulness of our measure by showing that it more accurately captures the effect of financial market stress levels on electoral volatility. We also show how KPCA can be used to efficiently summarize large quantities of texts into cross-sectional time-series variables.

We need ameasure of actors’ contemporary perceptions of financial market conditions to understand whythey made a given choice and with what effects.Previous binary crisis measures are constructed post hoc, so tend to be biased towards severecrises and away from circumstances where governments effectively responded to emerging trouble.As such, they suffer from clear selection bias. Annual post hoc measures do not necessarilycapture conditions as they were perceived at the time of events such as elections. As dichotomousindicators, they neither measure crisis severity nor how it varies over time. They use ad hocmethods to determine when crises have ended. Previous continuous measures of financial marketstress are less common and suffer from other problems. They capture quantities whose importance,measurement, and reporting varies significantly across countries and over time.To overcome these issues, we develop a continuous measure of real-time perceptions offinancial market stress with a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) of detailed qualitativedata, namely monthly Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) reports. We call it the EIU Perceptionsof Financial Market Stress Index: FinStress for short. FinStress enables new political researchpossibilities. As a continuous measure, FinStress could be used to examine which policies areeffective at preventing or reducing extreme stress and which political conditions are conducive to∗Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University, International Politics City, University of London, andHertie School of Governance (gandrud@iq.harvard.edu); Hertie School of Governance (hallerberg@hertie-school.org).Thanks to Nicole Rae Baerg, Vincent Arel-Bundock, Ronen Palan, Stefano Pagliari, David Singer, participants at the2015 American Political Science Association Annual Conference, the 2015 International Political Economy SocietyConference, and City, University of London work in progress series, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.We also thank Sahil Deo and Christian Franz for early research assistance.

As a comparable continuous monthly indicator, FinStress could beused to test hypotheses that rely on sub-annual data and follow the intensity of stress over time.Here we provide examples for studying the impact that financial market stress has on voters’choices and on revisions to European Union government budget figures.Not only do we create and demonstrate the usefulness of this measure, we contribute to thewider methodological toolkit by showing how KPCA can be used to summarize vast quantities ofsimilarly formatted qualitative texts into continuous cross-sectional time-series indicators.Previous measures and their use in researchBinary measuresResearchers studying the politics of financial crises mostly rely on two sources of cross-countryinformation about crises. The first is from Reinhart and Rogoff.1 The second is from Laeven andValencia.2Reinhart and Rogoff classify countries in crisis when they experience at least one type ofevent: (1) one or more bank run, closure, merger, or public sector takeover and/or (2) closure,merger, takeover or large-scale public assistance of an important financial institution that marksthe start of a string of similar events.3Laeven and Valencia take a similar approach that emphasizes public interventions. A country-year is in crisis when there is both significant distress in the banking system and policymakersrespond with significant interventions.4These binary crisis indicators come from detailed comparative work that identifies key featuresof crises. Yet, they have a number of problems for studying political behavior. Crises are identifiedpost hoc by researchers who know what happened after the fact. Financial market stress thatpolicymakers successfully address, which prevents a crisis, is not included. Similarly, stress thata government temporarily dampens through unsustainable policy measures, only to flare up later,is not recorded. The measures are dichotomous. They do not indicate crisis severity nor howit changes over time. Having an annual dichotomous measure also means that measurementerrors–incorrectly timing the start or end of a crisis–can bias statistical model estimates.There are large inconsistencies between the timing of crises in the Laeven and Valencia andReinhart and Rogoff data sets.5 Moreover, there are significant differences in crisis timing betweendifferent versions of the Laeven and Valencia data.6 While the measures use precise definitions ofwhen a crisis started, reasons for dating the end of a crisis are either unstated, as in the case ofReinhart and Rogoff, or are ad hoc. Laeven and Valencia7 determine that a crisis has concludedwhen real GDP and real credit growth are positive for two years, or five years have elapsed fromthe crisis start year.Despite these shortcomings, the indicators have been widely employed in the literature.Fielding and Rewilak and Herrera, Ordoñez, and Trebesch use Laeven and Valencia’s indicatoras a dependent variable to understand how capital flow bonanzas affect the probability of crises1Reinhart and Rogoff 2009, 2010.2Laeven and Valencia 2013, along with their predecessors.3Reinhart and Rogoff 2009; 2010, 10.4Laeven and Valencia 2013, 228. Please see the Online Appendix for more details.5Chaudron and Haan 2014.6Gandrud and Hallerberg 2015.7Laeven and Valencia 2013, footnote 19.Measuring Real-Time Perceptions of Financial Stress 3occurring.8 Danielsson, Valenzuela, and Zer use Reinhart and Rogoff to understand how stockprice volatility predicts crises.9 Keefer and Rosas use earlier versions of the Laeven and Valenciadata set to identify periods of crisis and to argue that electoral competitiveness affected policyresponses.10 Reischmann employs the Laeven and Valencia measure to examine electoral effects on“creative public budget accounting” during crises.11 Ha and Kang use Laeven and Valencia to findthat developing country governments respond to crises with fiscal and monetary tightening, thoughthis is moderated by political constraints.12 Gandrud and Kleibl combine the two data sourcesto understand how financial regulatory structures are changed after crises.13 Broz integrates thedata sets to find a “partisan financial cycle”.14 Crespo-Tenorio, Jensen, and Rosas, Chwieroth andWalter, and Pepinsky use the data sets in their research on the political effects of crises.15Continuous measuresThere are alternative approaches to measuring financial stress that, while being less used in theliterature, not only aim to code extreme stress, but also continuous variation in severity over time.In particular, Romer and Romer use a 16 point scale of the cost of credit intermediation to providean indication of stress intensity. They code 24 countries using information from the OECD’ssemi-annual Economic Outlook reports from 1967 to 2007. Relying on contemporaneous reportsallows for the construction of a real-time measure of credit market distress and addresses potentialproblems with ex post coding.16While their approach is an improvement over previous work, it is limited. First, their datasource confines them to a relatively small sample of OECD countries. Second, because theirmeasure is laborious and time consuming to create and update, even if there were a moreencompassing corpus, applying the method would be costly. Third, human coders can introducewell-known problems of inter-coder reliability and unreproducibility.17Creating the FinStress IndexWe overcome many of these problems by estimating real-time perceptions of financial marketstress through machine classification of Economist Intelligence Unit reports.18 Our methoduses kernel principle component analysis19 of monthly country reports from the EIU to create amonthly index for 186 countries from 2003 through 2011.8Fielding and Rewilak 2015; Herrera, Ordoñez, and Trebesch 2014.9Danielsson, Valenzuela, and Zer 2015.10Keefer 2007; Rosas 2006, 2009.11Reischmann 2016.12Ha and Kang 2015.13Gandrud 2013, 2014; Kleibl 2013.14Broz 2013.15Crespo-Tenorio, Jensen, and Rosas 2014; Chwieroth and Walter 2015; Pepinsky 2012.

Accessed May 2015.19Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller 1998; Lodhi et al. 2002; Spirling 2012.4 gandrud and hallerbergWhy the EIU?The EIU compiles real-time, third-party qualitative assessments of financial market conditionswithin country-time contexts. Reports are released at regular monthly or, for a small subsetof countries, quarterly intervals. These reports contain perceptions of economic conditions.They are an important channel for dissemination to public and private actors. They form alarge corpus–more than 20,000 texts–of reports for more than 180 countries over the period1997-2011. From 2003, they follow a consistent style and format, thus minimizing the extent towhich text analysis picks up stylistic features, rather than information on financial market stress.The regularity and frequency of reporting for such a large group of countries in a consistentformat distinguishes the EIU from other sources of financial information that we might analyse,chiefly newspaper reports. To take full advantage of format comparability we concentrate on datafrom 2003.Summarising financial market stress in the EIUWe want an index that classifies financial conditions on a continuous more-stressed/less-stressedspectrum for as many country-months as possible. Therefore, we need an efficient way tosummarize the vast quantity of information in the EIU reports. We first collected and pre-processed the EIU texts–focusing specifically on sections regarding banking and finance. See theOnline Appendix. We then used kernel principal component analysis to place the texts onto afinancial market stress spectrum.In political science, texts are frequently summarized using unordered “bags-of-words”approaches that aim to find clusters of topics within texts or clusters of texts around topics.20We would like to preserve word order in our texts. Many financial terms such as “credit growth”and “borrowing costs” have different interpretations depending on the adjectives that modifythem; consider, for example, “slowing credit growth” vs. “expanding credit growth” or “fallingborrowing costs” vs. “increasing borrowing costs”. Likewise, adjectives can have very differentimplications for describing market conditions depending on the nouns that they modify. Forexample, “increasing” can indicate worsening conditions–e.g. “increasing non-performingloans”–or improving conditions–e.g. “increasing lending”. A bags-of-words approach treatingeach word as having meaning as an individual unit, rather than in ordered associations with otherwords, would not adequately capture commonly used and radically different meanings.Kernel principal component analysis–developed by Scholkopf, Smola, andMuller and Lodhi etal.–allows us to address these issues. KPCA can extract structure from our likely high-dimensionalEIU corpus while preserving word order.21Note that we also conducted the analysis using bag-of-words PCA. While less computationallyintensive to estimate, it resulted in a less valid measure (see the Online Appendix).Our unit of analysis is a sub-string kernel: a short sequence of letters22 that can be sharedwithin and across words. Thus we can distinguish between two simple documents with thestemmed strings “slow credit” and “expand credit”. They share the five character kernels “credi”20See Grimmer and Stewart 2013.21Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller 1998; Lodhi et al. 2002. See also Zhang, Wang, and Ma 2010, 6531–6537 andSpirling 2012, who introduced KPCA into political science with a study of Native American-US treaties.22The kernels are similar to n-grams though they do not need to be complete words. Following Spirling 2012, weused kernels with a length of five, i.e. those that are five letters long. See also Lodhi et al. 2002 who demonstrate that inEnglish string lengths between four and seven are often optimal. See the Online Appendix for a comparison of estimatesmade using other lengths. The results were very similar regardless of kernel length.Measuring Real-Time Perceptions of Financial Stress 5and “redit”, but differ on “low c” and “and c”, among others. We summarize the similarity ofthese documents with the frequency distribution of five-length strings that they have in commonstandardized by document length. We find these pairs for all of the documents in our corpus tocreate a kernel matrix. We then scale the documents using principal component analysis,23 usingthe first component as our indicator (see the Online Appendix), and made two final transformations.First, we rescaled it so that it would be between zero and one.24 This eases interpretation. Second,we smoothed the results by taking a two period–usually two months–moving average.Validation and descriptionThe solid lines in Figure 1 show FinStress for a selection of countries. What does this indicatorrepresent? Grimmer and Stewart argue that to validate the results of a text analysis we need “carefulthought and close reading . . . extensive and problem-specific validation”.25 We qualitativelyexamine a selection of the texts classified as being at various FinStress levels. We extensivelycompare FinStress to other measures of financial market stress. A portion of this exercise ispresented here. Please see the Online Appendix for more details.Qualitative examinationTable 1 shows a progression of texts in the lead up and height of the 2008 United States crisis.The first text is from the observed United States minimum FinStress month–April 2006. The textdiscusses strong business investment. A year later, the FinStress score increased significantlyto 0.41. Likewise, the language changed. The EIU notes a “slump in the housing market” andthat liquidity for lower quality mortgages is “drying up”. The following year, shortly after thefailure of Bear Sterns, the FinStress score increased to 0.5. The text notes that the bail-out of BearSterns has “increasingly swung” market participants to think that the worst is over. FinStress isclearly higher than before, but far from its peak, reflecting the cautiously positive assessmentin the EIU report. FinStress rose to 0.62 in September 2008 (a report that was released beforeLehman Brother’s failure). This report notes increasing lending risks as well as threats to the“stability of weak financial institutions”. In November 2008 FinStress rose close to the UnitedStates maximum with the EIU noting that there is a “credit crunch”. FinStress closely tracks EIUreports describing increasingly worrying financial market conditions.23We conducted KPCA with the kpca function from the R package kernlab (Karatzoglou et al. 2004).24x−min(X )max(X )−min(X ) , where X is the vector of the first principal component and x is an individual value from this vector.25Grimmer and Stewart 2013, 267.6 gandrud and hallerbergtable 1: Portions of Selected EIU Reports for the United States (2006-2008)Month-Year FinStress Text SelectionApril 2006 0.13Corporate profitability improved remarkably in 2004-05, and this isallowing firms to fund investment from current profits.April 2007 0.41A slump in the housing market is starting to have an impact on theconsumer sector . . . with liquidity in the markets for inferior qualitymortgages (sub-prime and Alt-A) drying up-through stricter lendingstandards and rising risk aversion by more mainstream lendersMay 2008 0.5Financial markets have recovered somewhat in recent weeks, as marketparticipants have increasingly swung to the belief that the worst of thefinancial crisis is over.

Crises are automatically terminated at the end of 2009 due to the series not extendingbeyond this point.Areas with medium darkness shading indicate periods where a crisis is recorded for both measures.8 gandrud and hallerbergComparison with other indicesWe now compare FinStress to the dichotomous measures of banking crisis developed by Reinhartand Rogoff26 and Laeven and Valencia,27 as well as Romer and Romer’s28 continuous measure.29We expect that our measure is capturing many of the same events, but with more nuance inmagnitude and over time.Figure 1 compares FinStress to three other measures of financial stress. In many cases–conditional on the coverage of each data series30–the indices substantively overlap. Comparisonswith Romer and Romer 2015 are limited by data availability, but clearly there are cases whereFinStress and their index are similar. For example, both indices increase in the US from early2007. A notable difference is how Romer and Romer classify Japan as being without stress frommid-2005, while FinStress decreases, but to a high level compared to many other economicallydeveloped countries at that time. Both indices classify Iceland as being under stress in the late2000s, the timing is different. Romer and Romer classify Iceland as in stress31 in 2006-2007.This is earlier than not only a marked increase in the FinStress Index, but also Reinhart and Rogoffand Laeven and Valencia’s timing.High FinStress levels should appear where there is crisis in the dichotomous codes, but thereverse may not be true–the dichotomous indices may miss a building crisis as perceived at thetime. Laeven and Valencia and Reinhart and Rogoff should have more Type II errors–there aresigns of stress but they miss them. Laeven and Valencia’s coding is stricter because countriesboth have to experience distress and have a particular policy response, so the associated FinStresslevels should be higher.We do find that the mean FinStress level during periods that Laeven and Valencia classifyas crises–i.e., financial market stress reached the point where politicians responded using apre-specified set of policies–is higher than non-crisis periods.32 Though developing countriestend to have higher FinStress scores, countries defined by Laeven and Valencia as in crisis inboth groups have FinStress scores around 0.59 on average. Those not in Laeven and Valenciacrises have lower scores.33 The fact that mean FinStress is higher during periods that Laevenand Valencia classify as crises, but not dramatically, supports the proposition that they missconsiderable periods of budding and high stress and perhaps suffer from more Type II errors.Laeven and Valencia34 comment that part of the problem with dating financial crises is thateach one develops differently:26Reinhart and Rogoff 2009.27Laeven and Valencia 2013 identify eight “borderline” crises in this period, in that the countries almost meet theirsystemic banking crisis definition because they only used two rather than three policy responses. These are: France,Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland.28Romer and Romer 2015.29We use Table 1 in Romer and Romer 2015 to recreate their data set. The Laeven and Valencia data is from:https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26015.0. Reinhart and Rogoff’s data was downloaded from:http://www.carmenreinhart.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7/. Accessed May 2015.30Romer and Romer 2015 do not include the most recent crisis in their sample as they did not collect data past 2007.We rescale their 16-point scale to be between 0 and 1. It should be noted that Romer and Romer 2015 only cover aselection of OECD countries. Reinhart and Rogoff 2009 only cover 70 countries and their data has been updated leastrecently.31They classify Iceland as having a “minor crisis” in the second half of 2006 and a “credit disruption” in the first halfof 2007.320.59 and 0.52, respectively. This is a statistically significant difference using one-sided and two-sided t-tests.33See the Online Appendix for a discussion of the distributions of FinStress scores in developed vs. developingeconomies.34Laeven and Valencia 2013, 227.Measuring Real-Time Perceptions of Financial Stress 9Some crises evolve gradually, gaining speed as the ripple effects from a seeminglysmall shock propagate forward in time . . . other episodes happen more abruptly andare often the result of sudden stops.FinStress’ real-time continuous measurement and monthly periodicity allows us to distinguishthese types. We can see in Figure 1 that financial market difficulties in the United States builtover a long period, with a few spikes during notable banking difficulties, e.g. Bear Stearns’ andLehman Brothers’ collapse. Conversely, countries such as Germany, Hungary, and Iceland havemore sudden periods of perceived financial distress. The Greek case presents an interestingtrajectory. There is a notable spike in Greek financial stress in 2008–when both Reinhart andRogoff 2009 and Laeven and Valencia 2013 determine a crisis had started. This is then followedby a stable period, followed by a sudden uptick in 2010, which was when a possible governmentdefault severely threatened the banking system.Kazakhstan is notable for another path: rapid stress onset and just as rapid dissipation. Inlate 2009 there was a prominent spike in perceptions of stress directly related to a credit crunchresulting from the Global Financial Crisis. According to an IMF assessment, a large and quickpolicy response–facilitated by the country’s sizable National Oil Fund–within a few monthsreturned stability to the country’s banking system.35 Kazakhstan’s FinStress score returns almostto its previous trend level at that time. Annual binary measures of crises do not capture thesechanges.We can use FinStress to identify periods where financial market conditions were perceivedto be worsening, though for whatever reason these perceptions changed before other measureswould record a financial crisis. Australia in late-2008/2009 is a notable example. It had a clearspike in perceptions of stress shortly after Lehman Brothers’ collapse. Fairly quickly thereafter,its FinStress score returned to its previous level. Laeven and Valencia and Reinhart and Rogoffdo not distinguish these periods.FinStress’ advantages are also apparent for timing the end of heightened distress. This is adifficult issue for the binary indicators. Crisis onset is well-defined by these measures, but theyrarely have a clear or non-ad hoc way of determining when a crisis ended. Though we are limitedby the time period coverage of the EIU texts, it is clear that some countries, notably Switzerland,the United Kingdom, and the United States, were perceived to have had improved financial marketconditions from about 2010. Other countries, particularly Eurozone countries plateaued at a highlevel through the end of 2011, a period that corresponds with the Eurozone crisis. Laeven andValencia’s measure uses an ad hoc definition of crisis termination and so classifies these entireperiods as crises with equal intensity.ApplicationWe now provide examples of how FinStress can be applied in political science research anddemonstrate that it performs as well or better than previous binary measures.35See: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/car081710a.htm. Accessed November 201510 gandrud and hallerbergFigure 2: Hypothetical Scenarios of Error in the Measurement of Financial Market Stress at Elections Usingan Annual Binary Measure vs. FinStressShaded areas indicates years classified as a crisis by a hypothetical binary crisis measure. Dashed vertical lines indicate an election.Exploring the functional form of the relationship between crisis and electoral volatilityFollowing the Global Financial Crisis there has been considerable interest in how financial stressmay hasten government failure,36 how crises increase electoral support for extremist parties,37and how negative economic events and crises increase electoral volatility, i.e., the degree to whichvoters switch support for parties from one election to another.38 Crespo-Tenorio, Jensen, andRosas and Funke, Schularick, and Trebesch both rely on Laeven and Valencia’s binary measure,39while Hernández and Kriesi use an even simpler measurement of crisis: whether or not an electionoccurred after November 2008.40Figure 2 presents hypothetical scenarios to illustrate possible measurement error whenestimating the effect of financial market stress on elections. The top-left panel illustratestime-order measurement error. Using annual indicators of crisis may ascribe a level of stressto an election that was not perceived at the time. This type of error could lead to systematicunder-estimation of the effect of financial market stress.The upper-right panel of Figure 2 illustrates incorrectly measuring the intensity of financialmarket stress for two elections held during a period of heightened stress. Using a binary crisismeasure codes the elections as occurring at equivalent stress levels. This error could lead tounderestimation of the effect of crisis on election outcomes. Additionally, a binary measurewould not allow us to examine if there was a non-linear effect of stress, e.g., perhaps very highstress has an exponentially stronger effect on outcomes than medium levels.36Crespo-Tenorio, Jensen, and Rosas 2014.37Funke, Schularick, and Trebesch 2015.38Mainwaring, Gervasoni, and Espana-Najera 2016; Hernández and Kriesi 2015.39Crespo-Tenorio, Jensen, and Rosas 2014; Funke, Schularick, and Trebesch 2015.40Hernández and Kriesi 2015.Measuring Real-Time Perceptions of Financial Stress 11Figure 3: Comparing National Election Timing, FinStress, and Laeven and Valencia’s (2013) Banking CrisisMeasure in EuropeDashed vertical lines indicate national government elections.Lightly shaded areas represent Laeven and Valencia 2013 banking crisis periods.Finally, the lower-left panel of Figure 2 provides a scenario where both a binary crisis measureand FinStress levels would not capture potentially important features of how voters perceivedstress at elections xc and yc . Even though the binary and FinStress levels are the same in theformer, stress is worsening, while in the latter conditions are improving. Voters might be morehostile to incumbents as conditions worsen and more favorable when conditions improve. Thebinary measure would not allow us to examine this possibility.These are not just hypothetical examples. Figure 3 compares national election dates in 19European countries to FinStress scores and Laeven and Valencia crisis periods. There are electionswhere notably elevated FinStress levels and Laeven and Valencia 2013 crises overlap. Theseinclude Belgium (June 2010), Germany (October 2009), and Iceland (May 2009). There are alsonotable examples of the binary crisis indicator coding an election as occurring in a crisis wellbefore voters would likely have perceived one in their country. This includes Austria (October2008), Portugal (October 2009), and Spain (March 2008). It would be inaccurate to estimate theeffect of a crisis, which had not yet occurred, in these cases on voters’ actions. There are alsoinstances where financial market stress had declined or was notably declining by the time of theelection, but the binary crisis measure still coded a full intensity crisis. This includes Sweden(October 2010) and the Netherlands (June 2010).In light of these measurement issues, and assuming that electoral volatility will be higherunder more stressful economic conditions, we anticipate that the binary crisis measure willunderestimate the effect of financial market stress on volatility compared to FinStress.To examine this we use data on electoral volatility in Western European countries fromEmanuele.41 He codes the total electoral volatility of an election by summing vote switching41Emanuele 2015.12 gandrud and hallerbergbetween existing parties, new parties, and failed parties. Because we want to compare theestimated effects of the two financial market stress measures, we separately ran simple normallinear models of volatility including the stress measures on the right-hand side.42Figure 4 shows predicted electoral volatility–which ranges from 2.5 to 29.6 in the sample–under various fitted levels and measures of stress. The first row of plots shows results from simplelinear specifications. As expected, while both the binary and continuous measures are estimatedto have a significant–at the 10 percent level–positive effect on volatility, the predicted effect ofFinStress is somewhat stronger. The bottom-left panel of Figure 4 shows predicted electoralvolatility from a model estimated by adding a quadratic term. Above FinStress scores of about 0.6we estimate a rapidly increasing effect of FinStress on volatility. At the highest levels, volatility ispredicted to be much higher than anticipated by the binary measure of crisis and linear FinStress.The average predicted volatility at the highest FinStress levels under the quadratic specification is20.9, while it is 15.3 in the linear FinStress specification and 14.4 for the binary measure.The middle-left panel of Figure 4 shows the predicted volatility for the range of observedchanges to FinStress from the previous 12-month moving average. Large increases in stresscompared to the average level over the previous 12 months is associated–at the 10 percentsignificance level–with increased electoral volatility. Stated conversely, improving financialmarket conditions are predicted to lead to less vote switching. The closest analogue to examiningthe effect of stress changes on volatility for the binary measure is to create a binary crisis-startyear variable.43 In contrast to the estimates with the FinStress change variable, we did not find astatistically significant effect at any level of Laeven and Valencia crisis onset on electoral volatility(Figure 4, middle-right panel).Comparing model fitWe further compare the usefulness of FinStress to the Laeven and Valencia binary crisis measureby comparing the adjusted R2 from models with the two indices. A higher adjusted R2 wouldindicate that a variable explains more of the variance in the dependent variable.We use regressions with electoral volatility as the dependent variable, as well as a substantivelyvery different variable: cumulative revisions to EU member state government debt statisticsmade by the European Union’s statistical agency–Eurostat. Gandrud and Hallerberg44 usedthis variable to examine the political and economic conditions associated with Eurostat–anindependent statistical agency–revising government debt statistics. One of their findings wasthat governments facing unscheduled elections, during financial crisis were more likely to havetheir debt statistics revised upwards. The authors argue that this is likely because incumbentsunder-report debts during stressful times to make themselves more attractive to voters.We ran identical linear regression models with the dependent variables, changing only whetherwe included FinStress, the FinStress polynomial discussed earlier, or the binary crisis measure.The results are shown in the Online Appendix. For electoral volatility, the model with polynomialFinStress has an adjusted R2 about 1.8 times higher than that with the binary measure (0.193 vs.0.109). For debt revisions the difference is more modest, with the FinStress model having anadjusted R2 1.08 times that of the binary model (0.405 vs. 0.375). When using debt revisions42We are solely interested in comparing estimates between the stress measures and given our small sample size, othereffects were consigned to the error term. The sample used is that shown in Figure 3.43Following McGrath 2015, we drop observations for years after the start of a crisis. Given the arbitrary five yearcrisis termination coding used by Laeven and Valencia 2013 and our limited sample, all crises were right-censored, wewere not able to examine the effect of coming out of a crisis.44Gandrud and Hallerberg, forthcoming.Measuring Real-Time Perceptions of Financial Stress 13010200.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Predicted Electoral VolatilityLinear: Finstress (level)ll01020No Crisis CrisisPredicted Electoral VolatilityLinear: Laeven & Valencia Banking Crisis01020−0.2 0.0 0.2Predicted Electoral VolatilityLinear: FinStress (change 12 mnth moving mean)ll01020Not Start Year Start YearPredicted Electoral VolatilityLinear: Laeven & Valencia Crisis Start010200.2 0.4 0.6 0.8Predicted Electoral VolatilityQuadradic: FinStress (level)Figure 4: Predicted Electoral Volatility for Representative Levels of FinStress and Laeven and Valencia(2013) Banking CrisisShaded regions/vertical lines represent 95 percent confidence intervals.14 Referencesas the dependent variable, monthly FinStress was collapsed into its annual average to put it onthe same time scale as the annual dependent variable. It is not surprising that the relative modelfit is better with monthly FinStress than when it is collapsed into an annual average, and thus ismore similar to the annual binary measure. The former operationalization leverages FinStress’continuous measurement level and high frequency, whereas the latter reduces this information.ConclusionWe introduced a novel continuous measure of real-time perceived financial stress–FinStress–andcompared it to prior measures of financial stress and crisis. We showed how this monthlycontinuous indicator–created with unsupervised text analysis–provides more accurate estimatesof the impact stress has on political events like elections than less finely, but more laboriouslyconstructed indicators.Ourmethodologicalwork has implications for thewider research community. We demonstratedhow researchers could construct continuous indicators of other political and economic phenomenausing machine learning and text analysis of large corpuses of similarly formatted texts. Oncea text gathering and analysis “pipeline”45 has been developed and validated, researchers canefficiently estimate and update new indicators.46 This approach is especially useful in comparisonto time-consuming, expensive, and irreproducible human coding techniques for collections ofsimilarly formatted texts.ReferencesBroz, J.
