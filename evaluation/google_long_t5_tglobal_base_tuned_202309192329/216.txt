ABSTRACT: 
This paper examines determinants of one aspect of sexual behaviour--coital frequency--among 2,188 married women in the Central African Republic using a secondary analysis of data from the Demographic and Health Survey of 1994-95. Female genital cutting (or circumcision) is practised in the Central African Republic and self-reported circumcision status was included in the questionnaire enabling it to be examined as a possible determinant of coital frequency. Multiple logistic regression was used to find a subset of factors independently associated with coital frequency. Decreased coital frequency was found in those who had longer duration of marriage, those who were not the most recent wife in a polygamous marriage and those who had more surviving children. Coital frequency was higher in more educated women and those not contracepting because they wanted to get pregnant. After adjusting for confounders no association between female genital cutting and coital frequency was found. The extent to which women can control coital frequency in this culture is not known and fertility desires may override any negative effects of circumcision on sexual pleasure. It was therefore not possible to draw conclusions about how female genital cutting affects a woman's desire for sexual intercourse and consequently there is a need to develop research methods further to investigate this question.

This paper examines determinants of one aspect of sexualbehaviour – coital frequency – among 2188 married women in the CentralAfrican Republic using a secondary analysis of data from the Demographicand Health Survey of 1994–95. Female genital cutting (or circumcision) ispractised in the Central African Republic and self-reported circumcisionstatus was included in the questionnaire enabling it to be examined as apossible determinant of coital frequency. Multiple logistic regression was usedto find a subset of factors independently associated with coital frequency.Decreased coital frequency was found in those who had longer duration ofmarriage, those who were not the most recent wife in a polygamous marriageand those who had more surviving children. Coital frequency was higher inmore educated women and those not contracepting because they wantedto get pregnant. After adjusting for confounders no association betweenfemale genital cutting and coital frequency was found. The extent to whichwomen can control coital frequency in this culture is not known and fertilitydesires may override any negative eﬀects of circumcision on sexual pleasure.It was therefore not possible to draw conclusions about how female genitalcutting aﬀects a woman’s desire for sexual intercourse and consequentlythere is a need to develop research methods further to investigate thisquestion.IntroductionFemale genital cutting (FGC) is a term used to describe traditional practices thatinvolve the cutting of female genitalia. Other commonly used terms for theseprocedures are female circumcision, female genital mutilation (FGM) or femalegenital surgeries. It is estimated that around 130 million women world-wide haveundergone FGC and that 2 million girls and women a year are subjected to these525operations (Toubia, 1996). Genital cutting is usually performed on children bytraditional practitioners in non-sterile conditions.The World Health Organization has classified these operations into four types(WHO, 1997). Type I involves the partial or total removal of the clitoris. Type IIinvolves partial or total removal of the clitoris together with partial or total excisionof the labia minora. Type III usually involves partial or total removal of the externalgenitalia and stitching or narrowing of the vaginal opening. Type IV is relatively rareand refers to other traditional genital surgeries such as pricking or stretching theclitoris and/or surrounding tissues. An estimated 85% of cutting operations are TypeI or II with around 15% being the more severe Type III (Toubia, 1993). Femalegenital cutting tends to be practised in North-east Africa and in sub-Saharan Africanorth of the equator. Type III circumcision (infibulation) is restricted mainly toSomalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Sudan although it has been reported in Mali andnorthern Nigeria.The World Health Organization and many groups campaigning against FGCargue that a woman’s sexuality can be irreversibly damaged by FGC. Removing theclitoris and surrounding tissue is believed to reduce a woman’s capacity for sexualenjoyment (Toubia, 1993) and may leave a woman with damaged nerve-endings andscar tissue that would make intercourse painful. The psychological trauma associatedwith the cutting operation could also lead to sexual problems (Butcher, 1999).Infibulation (Type III), which involves closure of the vaginal opening, can be aproblem for both males and females, especially for a woman’s first intercourse. If theclosure is not too severe, gradual penetration may be possible, but otherwise thewoman has to be cut open to allow intercourse. Both these scenarios obviouslyinvolve pain and possibly psychological trauma (Almroth et al., 2001; Lightfoot-Klein, 1989a). However, empirical evidence on the eﬀects of FGC on sexual health isextremely scarce. Sexuality and sexual pleasure are diﬃcult areas to research, even insettings where discussion of sex is relatively open. In settings where FGC is practisedit is likely to be more unacceptable and diﬃcult to research sexuality. Indirectindicators, such as painful sex or coital frequency, are more acceptable alternativesthat might give some indication of the eﬀects on sexuality.The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are national surveys conducted ina standardized way in countries in the developing world. The main body of data isusually collected from women aged 15–49, and includes demographic characteristicsof the woman (with some information on her husband), detailed data on fertility andreported morbidity in the woman and her children. In 1994 a DHS was conductedin the Central African Republic (CAR). An estimated 43% of married women inCAR are circumcised with the predominant type of cutting being Type II, i.e. thepartial or complete removal of the clitoris and labia minora (Ndamobissi, Mboup& Nguelebe, 1995). Questions on circumcision status and coital frequency wereincluded in the DHS questionnaire enabling a comparison of coital frequencybetween cut and uncut women. Assuming that women in CAR have some controlover when and whether they have sexual intercourse with their partners, it ishypothesized that a finding of lower coital frequency among circumcised womenwould provide evidence in support of the argument that FGM damages a woman’ssexual health.526 H. Stewart, L. Morison and R. WhiteBackground information on the Central African RepublicThe Gbaya, 30% of the population, and the Banda, 25%, are the two largest ethnicgroups in CAR. Fifty-six per cent of women are Protestant, 34% Catholic,9% Muslim and 1% subscribe to an indigenous belief system (Ndamobissi et al.,1995). Seventy per cent of all women of reproductive age in CAR are currentlymarried or in a consensual union, although 12% of the women in a union are notliving with their partners. Nineteen per cent of women have never married, 2% arewidowed, 0·6% are divorced and 8·5% are separated. Almost 52% of women have noeducation while 35% have had some primary education and 13% secondary education.Seventy per cent are illiterate. The total fertility rate in CAR is 5·1 and 46% ofthe population is under the age of 15. Forty-four per cent live in urban areas (23%in the capital city of Bangui; Ndamobissi et al., 1995). The infant mortality rateis 103·4 per 1000 live births. Life expectancy is 41 years (Norwegian Council ofAfrica, 1997).An estimated 43% of married women in CAR are circumcised, predominantlywith Type II cutting. Eighty-eight per cent of circumcised women were cutbetween the ages of 5 and 14 years giving a median age at cutting of 10·8years (Carr, 1997; Ndamobissi et al., 1995). Figure 1 shows that the prevalence ofFGC varies greatly between ethnic groups, being highest in the Banda andMandija ethnic groups. Female genital cutting has been illegal in CAR since 1966(Ordinance No. 66/16 of February 22nd 1966) and the government is active inanti-FGC campaigns to educate the public against it. However, it is not clear whatimpact these activities have had. Figure 2 shows FGC prevalence by age andsuggests that there might be a slight trend for decreased prevalences over time(Carr, 1997).Fig. 1. Prevalence of female genital cutting for the eight largest ethnic groups in theCentral African Republic.Coital frequency in Central African Republic 527MethodsThe determinants of coital frequency, including FGC, were studied using a subset ofdata from the 1994–1995 DHS. The population was stratified into five healthauthority regions plus the capital city, Bangui, and by place of residence (urban, rural,Bangui and other towns). The selection procedure for the sample was by two-stagerandom sampling. The sample was not self-weighting, necessitating the use ofweighted analysis to give nationally representative statistics in the DHS report. Of6159 households selected, 5583 were visited from which 5551 (99·4%) were included inthe survey. Of the 5551 surveyed households, 6005 women were identified as eligiblefor the survey sample, of which 5884 (98%) were successfully surveyed.To study the determinants of coital frequency a subset of women was chosen. Thesample was restricted to those currently married or in a union where both partnerswere residing together. It was felt that it would be culturally more acceptable forwomen in this group to report on coital frequency and therefore that this selectionwould optimize the validity of the responses. Women who reported abstaining fromsex either postpartum (as is the tradition) or for other reasons were excluded from thestudy. Because of small numbers, women who reported an extramarital relationshipwere also excluded (n=47). Finally, to study the association between FGC and coitalfrequency adjusting for ethnic group the sample was restricted to those womenbelonging to ethnic groups where the prevalence of self-reported FGC was between15% and 85% (Fig. 1). Obviously, women who gave no answer to the question oncoital frequency (n=4) could not be included in the analysis.Figure 3 describes assumed links between the diﬀerent variables included in theanalysis. The more immediate determinants of coital frequency are hypothesized to bethree-fold: the quality of a woman’s relationship with her partner (which includes herautonomy within that relationship), her fertility desires and her circumcision status.The more distal determinants are the sociodemographic risk factors that may aﬀectFig. 2. Prevalence of female genital cutting in the Central African Republic by currentage of respondent.528 H. Stewart, L. Morison and R. Whitethe more immediate determinants but may also aﬀect coital frequency independently.Data were collected on each of these potential determinants in the DHS.Statistical analysisTwo variables were used to indicate the main outcome, i.e. coital frequency. Thefirst was the reported number of times sexual intercourse took place within thepreceding 4 weeks. The second variable was binary, categorized as ‘high’ coitalfrequency (sexual intercourse five or more times in the preceding 4 weeks) and ‘low’coital frequency (fewer than five times). This variable can also be thought of ascategorizing coital frequency into approximately ‘more than once a week’ versus ‘oncea week or less’.The distribution of coital frequency in the last 4 weeks was examined using ahistogram. The association between each possible determinant and coital frequencywas then described by creating tables comparing average coital frequency andproportion with ‘high’ coital frequency across levels of each determinant. Ninety-fiveper cent confidence intervals were calculated for the crude odds ratios using logisticregression models which adjusted for the two-stage sampling scheme.Multiple logistic regression models were then fitted to examine how the proportionof women reporting ‘high’ coital frequency varied across each possible determinant,adjusted for the others. The binary variable, ‘high’ frequency versus ‘low’, was chosenfor the multivariate analysis because the distribution of the data on actual frequencyof intercourse was highly skewed, violating the assumptions for ordinary multipleFig. 3. Conceptual framework representing hypothesized links between diﬀerentdeterminants and coital frequency.Coital frequency in Central African Republic 529regression. Variances were calculated in accordance with the two-stage samplingmethod used. Because of the large number of variables considered as possibledeterminants of coital frequency, the model-fitting procedure was complex. As a firststage, separate logistic regression models were derived for each set of determinants inthe conceptual framework (Fig. 1). For each of these models all variables that weresignificantly associated with coital frequency in the univariate analysis (describedabove) were entered into the model. Variables were then eliminated from the modelif they did not contribute significantly to the model (p<0·05) and did not substantiallyalter the odds ratio (OR) for the association between FGC and coital frequency. Thesecond stage involved making a combined model for all the determinants. First allvariables included in any of the logistic models using the more immediate determi-nants were entered into this model. Backward elimination was then used as before toexclude variables not contributing significantly to the model and not altering the ORfor the association of FGC with coital frequency. For the final model the more distaldeterminants were added to the model with backward elimination being used toobtain the most parsimonious model, as before.Stata 6 (StataCorp, 1999) was used to conduct the descriptive analysis and to fitthe logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 2188 women met the criteria for entry into the analysis for this paper.Figure 4 shows that over half the women reported a coital frequency of 4 times orless in the last 4 weeks, with only approximately 7% reporting a coital frequency ofFig. 4. Distribution of coital frequency in the last 4 weeks.530 H. Stewart, L. Morison and R. White13 or more. One woman who reported a coital frequency of 60 in the last 4 weekswas not included in the histogram but was included in the analysis.Sociodemographic determinants of coital frequencyThe univariate analysis showed reported coital frequency decreasing with age (testfor trend p<0·001) and increasing with level of education (Table 1). Religiousdenomination was also associated with coital frequency with Muslim womenreporting lower frequencies than Catholic women (OR=0·73, p=0·030). Coitalfrequency varied significantly between regions, being highest in RS I and lowest in RSIII and the capital. There was also a significant diﬀerence between ethnic groups withcoital frequency being highest in the Banda ethnic group and lowest in the Sara.Rural women reported higher coital frequency than urban women did (OR=1·45,p=0·006). After adjusting for other determinants of coital frequency only level ofeducation and region of residence remained as independent determinants. Ethnicgroup was included in the model with residence to examine whether diﬀerences inprevalence between ethnic groups explained the diﬀerences seen between regions. Theydid not.Determinants of coital frequency relating to marriage characteristicsCoital frequency decreased significantly (test for trend p<0·001) with duration ofmarital union (Table 2). Women in polygamous unions reported lower coitalfrequency than women in monogamous unions (OR=0·73, p=0·006) and coitalfrequency decreased significantly as the number of co-wives increased (test for trendp<0·001). Within polygamous marriages the most recent wives reported higher coitalfrequency than co-wives who were not the most recent wives (OR=0·69, p=0·010).There was no diﬀerence in coital frequency associated with age diﬀerence betweenpartners. There was little diﬀerence in coital frequency between women who hadan income and those who did not (p>0·05). However, coital frequency washigher where decisions were made jointly about how the woman’s money wasspent than when the woman decided alone (OR=1·48, p=0·001). After adjusting forother determinants, length of union and wife order remained as significant determi-nants of coital frequency, as did the variable characterizing decisions on the wife’sincome.Fertility desires as determinants of coital frequencyThere was an inverse relationship (test for trend p<0·001) between the totalnumber of surviving children a woman had and coital frequency (Table 3). Womennot contracepting because they wanted to get pregnant had a higher coital frequencythan other groups of women. Both of these determinants remained significantin the adjusted analysis. Women who reported that the number of children theyhad met or exceeded their ideal had a lower coital frequency than other groups ofwomen.Coital frequency in Central African Republic 531Circumcision status as a determinant of coital frequencyThe cut women in the study had a higher coital frequency than uncut women(Table 4, p<0·001). However, this eﬀect disappeared in the multivariate analysis.When models were fitted with cutting status and each other determinant separatelythey revealed that region was the main confounder of the relationship between cuttingTable 1.

Stewart, L. Morison and R. Whiteand coital frequency. Adjustment for ethnic group, religion, education and rural–urban residence had very little eﬀect on the association between cutting status andcoital frequency. The confounding eﬀect of region occurred because the three regionswith the highest coital frequencies (RS I, RS IV and RS V) had the highestproportions of circumcised women (73%, 96% and 93% respectively) compared withRS II, RS III and the capital (16%, 42% and 57% respectively). Within each regionthere was no significant association between cutting status and coital frequency,except for Region I in which coital frequency was higher in cut women. WithinRegion I adjustment for other variables, such as ethnic group, rural–urban residenceand level of education, did not aﬀect the association between cutting status and coitalfrequency.Table 2.

Questions on coital frequency may causeembarrassment (possibly leading to non-participation and consequent selection bias)and may be subject to recall bias (Westoﬀ, 1974; Trussell & Westoﬀ, 1980). A 1992evaluation of surveys of sexual behaviour in rural Senegal showed that retrospectiverecall of coital frequency over a 4-week period yielded much higher estimates thanthose obtained with a 7-day recall, although this was more serious for men (Enel,Lagarde & Pison, 1994; Lagarde, Enel & Pison, 1995). Rounding may result from thetime reference of 4 weeks. The figure a respondent gives may reflect a partiallystereotyped response of once a week multiplied by four, with account not being takenTable 3.

Stewart, L. Morison and R. Whitefor menstruation (Westoﬀ, 1974). Finally, diﬀerent expressions for sexual activity mayrender the respondent’s answers ambiguous, i.e. whether what they understand to besexual activity is actually coital intercourse. In the CAR DHS the term ‘rapportsexuel’ was used to define sexual intercourse, but this term connotes a range ofdiﬀerent understandings. This analysis has been conducted assuming that any biasesin answers on coital frequency would not be diﬀerent for cut and uncut women. Ithas also been assumed that possible reporting diﬀerences by other determinants, suchas ethnic group, will be accounted for by the logistic regression model used.There may be misclassification in cutting status of women. Studies in Egypt andthe Gambia showed high levels of agreement between reported status and what wasfound on clinical examination (Egyptian Fertility Care Society, 1996; Morison et al.,2001) while studies in Nigeria found poor agreement (Adinma, 1997). The homogen-eity of cutting type and the older age at cutting in CAR are similar to the Gambiaand unlike Nigeria where there is great heterogeneity in type and age of cutting.Fairly low levels of misclassification might therefore be expected. In any case, it seemsunlikely that rates of misclassification would vary across the diﬀerent determinants ofcoital frequency and thus bias the results.Limitations of the analysisUnmarried women were excluded from the analysis and it is possible that sexualproblems due to circumcision might aﬀect marital status. Similarly, whether cutwomen might extend the period of postpartum abstinence to avoid intercourse wasnot looked at. Women who reported extramarital aﬀairs were also excluded, as theirnumber was too low to include them in the analysis. Future research examining theseissues using DHS data may provide useful information on the eﬀects of FGC onsexuality. This analysis focused on married women who were residing with theirpartner. No data were available on short-term travel away from home, either by theman or the woman, and this would obviously aﬀect coital frequency.Table 4.

A number ofvariables thought to aﬀect coital frequency were incorporated into the regressionmodel.Coital frequency decreased with increasing age and increasing length of union, andwas lower for wives in polygamous unions who were not the most recent wife. Thesefindings are consistent with those of Carael (1995), who also found that age,polygamous union and duration of union were associated with decreased coitalfrequency in non-industrialized settings. Coital frequency decreased as the number ofsurviving children increased and was highest among women not contracepting becausethey wanted more children. This indicates that in this setting, desire for children is astrong motivation for having intercourse. Coital frequency increased with higher levelsof education and was highest in relationships where decisions were made jointly abouthow any income from the woman was spent. This may indicate that coital frequencyis higher in relationships with a greater level of communication.Type II genital cutting as a determinant of coital frequency was examined andhigher coital frequency was found among circumcised women. However, this wasfound to be the result of confounding by region and the eﬀect disappeared afteradjustment using multivariate regression. Ethnic group and the prevalence of cuttingstatus were both strongly associated with region. However, the significant diﬀerencesbetween the regions and the strong confounding eﬀect remained even after adjustingfor diﬀerences in ethnic group distribution.It is hypothesized that if married women in CAR have some degree of controlover coital frequency then it might be lower in cut women through two mechanisms.The first possible mechanism is that cutting makes sex more painful or uncomfortable.In the Type II cutting which is practised in CAR, the clitoris and labia minora arepartially or completely removed. If the introitus is scarred or Bartholins glandsmarred by cutting away the labia minora, the vaginal walls may become narrowed,inflexible and dry, and might therefore tear more easily. This might lead to recurrentpain and possibly increased risk of infection. However, in the Gambia, where TypeII cutting is also predominant, a survey of reproductive morbidity in around 1500rural women found that cut women were not significantly more likely than uncutwomen to have vulval tumours (such as Bartholin’s cysts and excessive keloidformation) on clinical examination or to report painful sex (Morison et al., 2001). Thesecond mechanism by which Type II cutting might reduce coital frequency is if itreduces the desire for sex. The clitoris and other tissues in the genital area that areremoved by Type II cutting are thought to be crucial for women to enjoy sex andexperience orgasm. As mentioned previously, sexual enjoyment and desire are diﬃcultand controversial to research. Several case studies have described deleterious eﬀects ofFGC on ability to enjoy sex, but most of these are for women who have beeninfibulated (Lightfoot-Klein, 1989a; Knight et al., 1999). For the reduction operationsfew data are available, and the only quantitative data found by the authors was froma survey in Egypt where 94% of women reported that they enjoyed sex. Obermeyer(1999) reviewed the somewhat scant data available on the eﬀects of reductionoperations (Types I and II) and infibulation on sexual health. This study concluded536 H. Stewart, L. Morison and R. Whitethat there was suﬃcient evidence of cut women enjoying sex to cast doubt on theassertion that FGC unequivocally functions to destroy sexual pleasure. It alsosuggested that there may be fundamental diﬀerences between cultures regarding thelink between genital organs and sexual enjoyment and that the emphasis on theclitoris as the centre of sexual enjoyment in the ‘West’ may be a social constructionrather than an indisputable physiological reality.One interpretation of the current study’s results is, therefore, that within thecultural context of CAR, the removal of the clitoris and other genital organs duringtraditional surgeries does not in fact function to increase painful sex and/or lessensexual desire compared with uncut women. However, another possible explanation isthat the strong drive to produce children overrides other considerations, such assexual pain or pleasure, in the desire to have intercourse. This would be consistentwith the very strong associations seen between coital frequency and fertilitycharacteristics in this study. A third explanation is that women in CAR have littlechoice in frequency of coitus. Polygamy is common in the study setting and withinthat system the husband is expected to ‘take turns’ with each of his wives. However,the higher coital frequency among new wives, and decreases in coital frequency withlength of union, suggest that this system is not strictly adhered to and that there issome choice in frequency of intercourse, but it is not clear to what extent any choicewould be the woman’s. Wolﬀe, Blanc & Gage (2001) studied the negotiation of sexin two rural districts in Uganda using large surveys in each district and qualitativemethods. The survey data showed that 60% of both men and women thought thatmen had more influence over whether to have sex. Around a third (32% of womenand 38% of men) thought the man and woman had equal influence while 8% ofwomen and 3% of men thought the woman had more influence. Urban residence andeducation both enhanced a woman’s ability to negotiate sex. In trying to ascertainnorms for sexual negotiation 61% of women and 71% of men said that a marriedwoman can refuse sex with her husband if she is ‘tired or not in the mood’ althoughcontinued refusal would be considered a serious problem to the marriage. In general,verbal communication to initiate sex was not acceptable for women but qualitativedata gave examples of the ways in which women non-verbally signal their wish forsex. Another example of non-verbal ways of communicating desire for sex is describedby Lightfoot-Klein (1989b) for Sudan. There women squat naked over embers,wrapped in a tent-like robe so that their skin absorbs volatile oils of burning spices,sandalwood, frankincense and myrrh (called a ‘smoke ceremony’). This signals to thepartner the woman’s desire and receptivity for sexual intercourse. These studies showthat while men generally have more influence over sex in African settings, women canand do initiate and refuse sex under a variety of circumstances. Still, it is not possibleto gauge the extent to which women determine coital frequency in CAR, andtherefore the extent to which coital frequency might decrease if cutting made sex morepainful or less pleasurable. It is therefore impossible within the limitations of thisstudy to know to what extent each of the above factors contributes to the lack ofassociation between FGC and coital frequency.While an association between the Type II FGC practised in CAR and decreasedcoital frequency would have provided quite strong evidence for a negative impact ofthis type of FGC on women’s desire for sexual intercourse, the lack of association isCoital frequency in Central African Republic 537more diﬃcult to interpret. The possible explanations for the lack of association foundin this study show that coital frequency may not be an indicator of a woman’s desirefor sexual intercourse in order to attain sexual pleasure. This problem will complicateall research on this topic as aspects of the culture, such as the extent to which awoman has control of coital frequency and whether pleasure or fertility desires are themain motivation for intercourse, are likely to be common in all settings where FGCis practised. Qualitative research is likely to be the most useful tool for investigatingthese aspects further. Well-designed studies on the eﬀects of FGC on reproductivemorbidity are also needed as these will provide indirect evidence on possible eﬀectson sexuality. The damage to health and sexuality will depend greatly on the type ofcutting performed. The lack of association found in this study was for Type IIcutting. Consequences to health and sexuality of Type III cutting are likely to be moresevere.ConclusionThis analysis has contributed detailed, empirical knowledge on determinants ofreported coital frequency, among married women in the Central African Republic.Decreased coital frequency was found in those who were older, had longer durationof marriage, were not the most recent wife in a polygamous marriage and had moresurviving children. It was higher in more educated women and in non-contraceptorswho reported wanting more children. After adjusting for confounders no associationbetween female genital cutting and coital frequency was found. This might be becausewomen do not control coital frequency, fertility desires override any pain or lack ofpleasure from intercourse, or because FGC does not greatly aﬀect desire forintercourse in women. It was therefore not possible to draw conclusions about therole of FGC and how it aﬀects a woman’s sexuality, and consequently there is a needto develop research methods to investigate this question.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Basia Zaba for the idea of using DHS data to examineFGC as a determinant of coital frequency, and also for her comments on the draft.They also thank the reviewers for their comments, which have much improved thispaper.ReferencesA, J.
