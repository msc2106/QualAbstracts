ABSTRACT: 
Various studies indicate that at the same noise level and during the daytime, annoyance increases in the order of rail, road, and aircraft noise. The present study investigates if the same ranking can be found for annoyance to nocturnal exposure and next day cognitive performance. Annoyance ratings and performance change during combined noise exposure were also tested. In the laboratory 72 participants were exposed to air, road, or rail traffic noise and all combinations. The number of noise events and LAS,eq were kept constant. Each morning noise annoyance questionnaires and performance tasks were administered. Aircraft noise annoyance ranked first followed by railway and road noise. A possible explanation is the longer duration of aircraft noise events used in this study compared to road and railway noise events. In contrast to road and rail traffic, aircraft noise annoyance was higher after nights with combined exposure. Pooled noise exposure data showed small but significant impairments in reaction times (6 ms) compared to nights without noise. The noise sources did not have a differential impact on performance. Combined exposure to multiple traffic noise sources did not induce stronger impairments than a single noise source. This was reflected also in low workload ratings.

The present study investigates if the same ranking can befound for annoyance to nocturnal exposure and next day cognitive performance.

A possible explanation is the longer duration of aircraft noise events used in this study com-pared to road and railway noise events. In contrast to road and rail traffic, aircraft noise annoyancewas higher after nights with combined exposure. Pooled noise exposure data showed small but sig-nificant impairments in reaction times (6ms) compared to nights without noise. The noise sourcesdid not have a differential impact on performance.

INTRODUCTIONActivities such as communication, relaxation, and recu-peration are considered to be especially sensitive to distur-bances by noise. The disturbance of sleep is one of the mostcommon reasons for noise complaints (Guski, 1991).Nocturnal traffic noise interrupts the physiological sleepstructure. Even though the sleeper is unconscious, noiseevents may cause accelerations of heart rate and EEG fre-quency, and may induce sleep stage changes to light sleepand awakenings. As a secondary effect performance can beimpaired, and chronic noise exposure may even promotenegative long-term effects like cardiovascular diseases(Babisch, 2011; Jarup et al., 2008).A glossary of acoustical parameters is given in Table I.Data from regularly conducted surveys by the GermanFederal Environmental Agency indicate that about half ofthe population in Germany is exposed to road traffic noise atlevels (LAeq,d above 55 dBA) at which impairments of physi-cal and social well-being are to be expected (Ortscheid andWende, 2002a,b). Regarding rail traffic the percentage isapproximately 20%. The acoustic exposure of the population(western areas of Germany) to road and rail traffic at manysites is high even during the night (German FederalEnvironmental Agency 2009 citing Ortscheid and Wende,2002a,b). For instance, during the night about half of thepopulation is exposed to road traffic noise levels(LAeq,n> 45 dBA) at which sleep disturbance must beexpected with opened windows (Berglund et al., 2000).Concerning rail traffic the proportion is about 37%. Likemost noise surveys the cited noise exposure levels refer tooutdoor measurements. However, a recent field comparisonof indoor and outdoor road traffic noise exposure showedthat sounds of domestic activity also play an important rolefor indoor noise exposure (Fidell et al., 2013).Often, noise annoyance studies focus on subjects whoare distributed in the upper 25% to 30% of the answeringscale (on a five-point scale the categories 4 and 5), theso-called “highly annoyed” (HA). The lower limit of this do-main is internationally used as a minimum value for individ-ual high annoyance (e.g., Fidell et al., 1991; Miedema andVos, 1998; Schultz, 1978). Recommended dose-responsecurves for transportation noises—road, rail, and air traffic—for annoyed individuals (50%) are described in the recentEuropean Environment Agency report 11/2010 (2010).Miedema and Vos (1998) compared the relationship betweenthe percentage of HA persons and aircraft, rail, and road traf-fic noise exposure (see also Fields and Walker, 1982; Fidellet al., 1991; Miedema and Oudshoorn, 2001). In general,annoyance shows a statistically monotonic relationship withLeq. However, with an equal level increase in LDN more per-sons feel highly annoyed by aircraft noise than by road andrail traffic noise. Regarding the latter two exposures, theroad traffic noise curve ranks above the curve for rail trafficnoise (see also Guski et al., 2004). Hence, aircraft noise hasthe highest annoyance potential compared to other traffica)Parts of the cognitive performance data were published in Basner, M.,Mueller, U., and Elmenhorst, E. M.

(2006) compared the effects of road, rail,and aircraft noise and tested the suitability of the equivalentsound level for the evaluation of sleep disturbances.Subjectively rated sleep quality decreased with the equiva-lent sound level, whereas most physiological variablesrevealed the same reactions to both the lower and consider-ably stronger reactions to the highest acoustic exposure.Aircraft, rail, and road traffic noise induced similar after-effects but physiological sleep parameters were mostseverely influenced by rail noise. The authors concluded thatthe equivalent sound level seems to be a suitable predictorfor subjectively assessed sleep quality but not for physiologi-cal sleep disturbances. Basner et al. (2011) have reportedthat road traffic noise had the highest impact on sleep struc-ture and continuity, whereas the subjective evaluation ofsleep was worse after nights with air and rail traffic noise ex-posure. In a field study on nocturnal rail and aircraft noise,awakening probability increased with increasing LAS,max,and rail traffic led to a higher awakening probability than air-craft noise exposure (Elmenhorst et al., 2012). Comparingdaytime, nighttime, and around the clock noise exposure,around the clock noise shows the strongest impact on per-formance followed by night-time noise (Hoeger, 2004). Todate, effects of night-time traffic noise on cognitive perform-ance the following day have been inconsistent. The numberof noise events during the night, LAS,max of noise events, aswell as LAS,eq have been proposed as important acousticalfactors (Bonnefond et al., 2008; €Ohrstrom, 1995; Wilkinsonand Campbell, 1984). Reaction time impairments have beenfound in a study on pooled data of road, rail, and aircraftnoise (Marks and Griefahn, 2007). Elmenhorst et al. (2010)have reported significant exposure-response relationships ofperformance decrements depending on number of nocturnalnoise events as well as LAS,eq. Several studies, however, didnot observe performance declines caused by road, rail, or air-craft noise (Griefahn et al., 2000; Marks and Griefahn, 2005;Schapkin et al., 2006). Breimhorst et al. (2009) hypothesizedthat the small or even not at all detectable performanceimpairments after nocturnal traffic noise exposure was aresult of increased effort during the execution of the tasks.However, blink rate as a measure of effort did not decreasewhile conducting the performance tests in relation to thenocturnal noise exposure. Recently, Matheson et al. (2010)stated that nighttime noise does not seem to add toperformance impairments caused by daytime noise exposurein schoolchildren.Exposure to multiple traffic noise sources is a majorproblem. Especially residents living along railway lines andnear airports are affected by exposure to two or even threetraffic noise sources simultaneously. According to theGerman Federal Environmental Agency (2009) (Ortscheidand Wende, 2002a,b), about 47 106 residents in Germanyare annoyed by road traffic noise, about 13 106 are addi-tionally annoyed by aircraft noise, and about 11 106 byrailway noise (Ortscheid and Wende, 2001). So far, there areno binding regulations concerning the assessment of noisesituations in which more than one noise source exists(Tegeder, 2001). However, there is a guideline of VDI(Association of German engineers) which handles the pa-rameters characterizing annoyance from multiple soundsources (VDI 3722, 2013). It is assumed that a noise situa-tion with multiple traffic noises is more annoying than a sit-uation with only one noise source. However, the evaluationof the whole situation is not simply additive, since the sourcespecific dose-response curves indicate different reactions toindividual traffic noise sources at the same acoustic energy.Accordingly, Oliva (1998) pointed out that the single noisesources cannot be integrated into a “holistic noise scenery,”since annoyance is reflected in the individual sound evalua-tions which are influenced by acoustic characteristics as wellas non-acoustic factors being at least as important as thenoise exposure itself (Evans and Lepore, 1997; Fields, 1993;Stallen, 1999).Studies on combined effects of different traffic noisesources are still rare. Objectives of the present study were tocompare the effects of aircraft, road, and rail noise, sepa-rately and in combination, on daytime cognitive perfor-mance and annoyance. The aims of the study were (1) toinvestigate if the same differences in annoyance betweentraffic noise sources can be found for nocturnal noise expo-sure as for daytime exposure, (2) to analyze if annoyanceratings regarding road, rail, and aircraft noise can change(i.e., be amplified or reduced) due to the existence of a sec-ond or third traffic noise, and (3) to study if the combinationof more than one traffic noise source during the night leadsto stronger impairments in daytime cognitive performancethan the exposure to only a single traffic noise. In compari-son to the exposure to only one traffic noise source, weinvestigated whether combined effects were more or lessthan additive.TABLE I.

Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 135, No. 1, January 2014 Elmenhorst et al.: Traffic noise, performance, and annoyanceII. METHODSA. Design and acoustical measuresThe study was designed to investigate and compare thethree different traffic noise sources—air (AI), road (RO), and rail(RA) traffic—under equal exposure conditions regarding numberof traffic noise events, maximum sound pressure level [soundpressure level (SPL): LAS,max] or average equivalent sound level(LAS,eq). All sounds and SPLs (sampling rate 0.125 s) wererecorded with a class-1 sound level meter NC10 (CortexInstruments, DIN IEC 651) inside residents’ buildings with openor closed windows. SPL measurements were A-weighted withthe time constant set to “slow.” The distances to the noise sourcewere selected in a way that the maximum level of the recordedsounds differed not more than 2dB(A) from the intended noisecategories of the study design. Details regarding acoustic charac-teristics of the noises are given in Table II. Nine different expo-sure patterns were applied during the nine nights of each of thenine study periods leading to a complete crossover design.(1) Three single exposure nights with 40 noise events of ei-ther aircraft, road or rail traffic noise (5 8 noise eventswith a maximum SPL of 45, 50, 55, 60, or 65 dBA pertraffic noise source): AI, RO, RA.(2) A single exposure night with 80 road traffic noise eventsat an LAS,eq equivalent to the single exposures to aircraftand rail traffic noise: RORO.(3) Three double exposure nights (aircraft and road trafficnoise, aircraft and rail traffic noise, road and rail trafficnoise) with 80 noise events each (40 per traffic noisesource): AIRO, AIRA, RORA.(4) One triple exposure night with all three traffic noisesources with a total of 120 traffic noise events (40 pertraffic noise source): AIRORA.(5) A noise-free baseline condition had a background LAS,eqof 30 dB caused by the A/C system of the sleep labora-tory: NO.Each rail noise dB-category consisted of four noiseevents from freight trains and four from passenger trains.Each road noise dB-category included five noise events frompassenger cars with dry roads, one event from passenger carswith wet roads, one event from motorcycles, and one eventfrom trucks. Each aircraft noise dB-category consisted ofeight noise events from jet aircraft that were recorded in thevicinity of the Cologne/Bonn airport. They were not furtherdivided with respect to take-off or landing. The single expo-sure nights of rail and air traffic were identical concerningLAS,eq. Because of the shorter duration of road traffic noiseevents, LAS,eq of the road traffic single exposure night waslower. In order to gain the identical LAS,eq for the road trafficsingle exposure night as well, the number of road noiseevents was doubled in the exposure night RORO. In thatway, it was possible to compare single exposure nightsaccording to the LAS,eq (Table III). In order to be able to bal-ance the study design, i.e., that each exposure was applied ineach study night position once, there were nine study periodswith eight different subjects in each study period. Each pe-riod contained all exposure conditions.The length of the time interval between two noise eventsdiffered depending on the number of noise events per nightand was otherwise randomly chosen using block randomiza-tion techniques. In nights with 40 noise events the time inter-val ranged between 3 to 21min, in nights with 80 noise eventsbetween 3 to 9min, and in the night with 120 noise eventsbetween 3 to 5min. Furthermore, the length of time intervalsbetween two noise events was evenly distributed over thenight to avoid clusters of short or long time intervals at the be-ginning or the end of the night. Therefore, the night was di-vided into four blocks with equal number of noise events.Time intervals of similar length were then assigned to the fourblocks and randomly distributed within each block. A similarprocedure was applied for maximum SPL of noise events.The noise playback started at a predefined point of time afterthe beginning of the time in bed period, which was aftertwelve minutes for the single exposure nights, after sixminutes for the double exposure nights and after four minutesfor the triple exposure night. The study was conducteddouble-blind; i.e., neither the investigators nor the subjectswere aware of the exposure pattern of the night.B.

Participants passed through a multi-stage selec-tion procedure including questionnaires, medical examination,and training of computer-assisted performance tests. Onlyhealthy volunteers participated who did not suffer from intrin-sic sleep disorders and had a normal hearing threshold accord-ing to their age. Subjects received reimbursement forparticipation. All subjects signed an informed consent accord-ing to the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee ofthe North Rhine Medical Board approved the study.C. ProcedureThe study took place in the occupational medical simu-lation facility (AMSAN) of the German Aerospace Centre(DLR); i.e., a sleep laboratory consisting of eight sleep cab-ins. Subjects were investigated for eleven consecutive nights.Night one was noise-free and served as adaptation to theunfamiliar environment and the measuring devices (sleep-EEG). In nights 2–10, subjects were exposed to differentnoise exposure patterns including a silent baseline condition.Night 11 served as recovery and back-up night and wasexcluded from data analysis. During the study period, sub-jects stayed in the laboratory from 7 pm until 8 am, duringthe day they were free to go on with their usual daily activ-ities. The beginning of the sleep period was scheduled for11 pm; a nightly time in bed of exactly 8 h was kept. Napsduring the day were prohibited and compliance was con-trolled with actigraphic monitoring.Traffic noise of air, road, and rail traffic was presentedvia loudspeakers in each private sleeping room. Acousticallycalibrated sleep cabins guaranteed a correct playback of theoriginal traffic noise events.D. Survey1. Cognitive performance measuresParticipants performed computer-assisted cognitive per-formance tests in the morning. The tasks were implementedon the test-software ERTS (experimental run time system) ofthe Berisoft Company. Participants trained the tests 24 timesin the run-up of the study to reduce training effects and guar-antee stable performance levels. To minimize effects due tomotivation, they were asked to perform the tests as quicklyand accurately as possible with constant effort.a. Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Participants per-formed a PVT with 10min duration (inter-stimulus interval:1.5–10 s). A white digital stopwatch (that showed the time inms) lighting up on the dark computer screen served as stimu-lus. Participants had to respond by pressing a key as fast aspossible. The number of presented signals depended on thereaction times of the participant. Reaction times  500mswere regarded as lapses (Dinges and Powell, 1985). The testtimed out after 1 s. Reaction times 130ms were most prob-ably reactions without stimulus (false starts) and thereforeexcluded from the analysis. Mean reaction time was calcu-lated excluding reaction times from lapses.b. Memory search task (MST). Four letters had to bememorized without time pressure at the beginning of thetask. In a 3min recall phase letters of the whole alphabetwere presented. The participant had to decide whether thecurrent letter belonged to the learning set or not by usingtwo predefined keys. Reaction times were recorded.Reaction times that were faster than 130ms were regardedas false responses and excluded from analysis. The taskbelongs to the AGARD STRES battery (AGARD, 1989).c. NASA task load index (TLX). NASA TLX is a ques-tionnaire asking for the subjective and retrospective evalua-tion of workload (Hart and Staveland, 1988). The scaleranges from 0 points (very low workload) to 20 points (veryhigh workload). Furthermore, each participant provides apersonal ranking of the importance of the questions rangingfrom 5 (very important) to 0 (not important). Scale value andrank importance were multiplied and summed up to get asingle value. Workload was then grouped into five categories(covering 60 points each) from 0 points (very low workload) to 300 points (very high workload).2. Annoyance measuresAfter having performed the cognitive test battery ques-tionnaire surveys were conducted. Subjects were askedwhich traffic noises they had perceived during the night. Thefirst question was: “Did you hear aircraft noise last night?”(answer alternatives: 1¼ no, 2¼ yes). Only when subjectsanswered this question with “yes” were more questions con-cerning the impact of aircraft noise asked (e.g., concerningthe aircraft noise annoyance). The perception and evaluationof rail and road traffic noise followed similarly. If subjectsperceived the noise of two or three traffic noise sources theywere asked by which of these sources they were moreannoyed (two traffic noises) or most annoyed (three trafficnoises).Annoyance due to nocturnal road, railway and aircraftnoise was rated using a five-point scale (from “1¼ not” to“5¼ very” annoyed) according recommendations of Team 6of the International Commission on Biological Effects ofNoise (ICBEN) (Felscher-Suhr et al., 2000; Fields et al.,2001).TABLE III.

Direct comparison of nocturnal aircraft, road, andrail traffic noise and annoyanceFigure 1 depicts the perception of the three traffic noisesources depending on the nocturnal exposure. It is apparentthat the perception of a specific traffic noise occurred moreoften after night with the corresponding exposure (aircraftnoise: AI, AIRA, AIRO, AIRORA, road traffic noise: RO,RORO, RORA, AIRO, AIRORA, rail traffic noise: RA,AIRA, RORA, AIRORA). Obviously, AI was recognizedvery well (94% correct answers), whereas RA was more of-ten confused with other traffic noise sources (78% correctanswers). However, sometimes participants perceived a spe-cific traffic noise that had in fact not been presented the nightbefore. For instance, 39% heard aircraft noise in the condi-tion RA. The following statistical analyses are based on thenights in which the presented traffic noises were perceivedcorrectly by the participants. (Analyses of the complete data-set revealed the same ranking except for the comparisonroad vs rail traffic.)Each morning subjects were asked which traffic noisesthey had perceived during the night. If it was the noise oftwo or three traffic noise sources they were asked by whichof these sources they were more annoyed (two traffic noises)or most annoyed (three traffic noises) (Fig. 2). In a directcomparison of double and triple exposure nights, aircraftnoise annoyed more than railway noise (68% vs 32%) andmore than road traffic noise (73% vs 27%). Even in nightswith all three traffic noises, aircraft noise was most annoying(70% vs 13%, respectively, 17%). In a direct comparisonbetween rail and road traffic noise, subjects felt moreannoyed by railway noise (64% vs 36%).B. Combined effects of nocturnal aircraft, road, andrail traffic noise and annoyanceThe nine exposure patterns were analyzed withFriedman tests. Significant effects on the annoyance ratingswere found due to aircraft noise (v2(3, 0.003)¼ 14.057) androad traffic noise (v2(4, 0.003)¼ 16.172), but not for railwaynoise annoyance (v2(3, 0.069)¼ 7.100).According to the Schultz criterion (Schultz, 1978), inFigs. 3 and 4, the original five-point answering scales werecombined in terms of gray shades. Categories 4 and 5 (highto very high annoyance: dark grays) as well as categories 1to 3 (none to moderate noise annoyance: white and lightgrays) were pooled. The frequency distribution of annoyancedue to aircraft and road traffic noise depending on the noc-turnal exposure is illustrated. Figure 3 shows that aircraftnoise annoyance was highest in the conditions AIRA (46%)and AIRORA (43%). These were followed by patternsAIRO and AI with a percentage of 40% and 28% highlyannoyed. In the paired comparisons (using the answers ofFIG. 1. Percentage of participants who perceived night time noise sourcesdepending on the exposure pattern.

AI¼ 40 aircraft noise events, RA¼ 40 rail traffic noise events,RO¼ 40 road traffic noise events, and combinations (e.g., AIRA: 40 aircraftnoise events plus 40 rail traffic noise events).J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 135, No. 1, January 2014 Elmenhorst et al.: Traffic noise, performance, and annoyance 217the original five-point annoyance scale), AIRA andAIRORA differed significantly from AI. In both cases, thecombination induced a significantly higher annoyance due toaircraft noise. This means that a situation with multiple traf-fic noise sources was significantly more annoying than a sit-uation with only aircraft noise. Therefore, an amplificationof aircraft noise annoyance due to the existence of a secondor third traffic noise has been affirmed.In Fig. 4 the percentage of HA due to road traffic noisewas highest in the conditions RORO (38%), AIRORA(28%), and AIRO (27%). These were followed by patternsRORA (24%), and RO (21%). The paired comparisonsdemonstrate significant differences between RO vs ROROas well as between AIRO vs RORO. In both cases, the con-dition RORO (80 road traffic noises with a LAS,eq equal toAI and RA) induced a significantly higher percentage ofHA. In other words, RORO with a LAS,eq equal to AI andRA caused a significantly higher annoyance than RO orAIRO. Thereby the relevance of the frequency of nocturnaltraffic movements for road traffic annoyance is stressedsince the number of road noise events in the RORO patternwas twice as high as the number of noise events in the ROand AIRO conditions.C. General effects of nocturnal aircraft, road, and railtraffic noise and cognitive performanceMixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SAS(version 9.2) was used for statistical analyses of performancedata. Post hoc tests were adjusted for a-inflation accordingto Dunnett or Tukey respectively. For the MST, hit rate (cor-rect yes response on a signal trial), false alarm rate (incorrectyes response on a noise trial), sensitivity [measure of detec-tion accuracy varying between 0.5 (signals are not differenti-ated from noise trials) and 1.0 (correct separation of signaland noise trials)] and bias [ranging between 1 (yesresponse to all trials) and þ1 (no response to all trials), with0 representing the absence of response bias] were calculatedaccording to the non-parametric signal detection theory.Table IV presents an overview on daytime performance afterthe adaptation night, the baseline night, and the noise pat-terns (pooled data of days after noise exposure nights).Reaction time in PVT was significantly impaired after noiseexposure. This effect was more pronounced comparing noiseto adaptation, than comparing noise conditions to the in thecross over design included baseline condition suggesting cu-mulative carry-over effects from preceding noise exposurenights that are still present after one night without noise.Reaction time increased significantly both with an increasingnumber of noise events (40 noise events 4.5ms, 80 noiseevents 4.8ms, and 120 noise events 4.9ms) and with equiva-lent noise level LAS,eq [between 4.8ms (LAS,eq 36.9) and5.0ms (LAS,eq 43.3)]. MST did not show any significantdifferences. Subjects rated the subjective workload as beinglow under adaptation, baseline, and noise exposures.D. Combined effects of nocturnal aircraft, road, andrail traffic noise and cognitive performanceData were analyzed with mixed ANOVA in SAS (version9.2) comparing the eight noise exposure conditions, baseline,and adaptation. Post hoc tests were adjusted for a-inflationaccording to Dunnett or Tukey respectively. Figure 5 showsthat performance was not especially influenced by one spe-cific traffic noise source, or by single compared to combinedtraffic noise exposure, when LAS,eq, or number of noise eventsare kept constant. Significant effects between the noise expo-sure conditions were not found. In comparison to the adapta-tion, mean reaction time in PVT was significantly impairedafter nights with the patterns AI [8.9ms (6 1.9 SE),FIG. 4.

Performance decrementsin PVT due to single, double, and triple exposure patternswere less than additive; i.e., it was expected that doubling ortripling the number of noise events led to higher reactiontimes but this was not confirmed by the data. Subjective rat-ing of workload (NASA TLX) was more than additive afterdouble exposure nights, but less than additive after the tripleexposure pattern.IV. DISCUSSIONA. Nocturnal traffic noise and annoyance1. A direct comparison of nocturnal aircraft, road, andrail traffic noise and annoyanceWhen asked by which traffic noise of the previous nightsubjects felt MORE annoyed (two traffic noise sourcesheard) or MOST annoyed (three traffic noise sources heard),aircraft noise annoyance ranked first followed by the annoy-ance due to railway and road traffic noise. This is only par-tially consistent with previous dose-response curvesaccording to which the road traffic noise annoyance curvelies above the railway noise annoyance curve. However,these curves apply to a 24 h Leq and not exclusively to noc-turnal traffic noise exposure. Regarding the grand averagecommunity tolerance level (CTL), however, our results con-firm the ranking of traffic noise annoyance. Schomer et al.(2012) found that annoyance is highest due to aircraft noisefollowed by conventional trains with vibration, road traffic,and finally trains without vibration. In direct comparison, theannoyance due to the single exposure pattern at a compara-ble equivalent sound level LAS,eq, RORO induced 38.1% ofHA followed by the conditions AI (27.8%) and RA (22.5%).This ranking of noise sources causing annoyance has beenreported previously for the German population (Ortscheidand Wende, 2004). The frequency of nocturnal traffic move-ments plays an important role since the number of noiseevents in RORO was twice as high as the number of noiseevents in the single patterns AI and RA. This is underlinedby the fact that the exposure condition RO, however, at anLAS,eq, lower than AI and RO induced only a percentage of21% HA. With numerous traffic noise events, it is morelikely that an individual consciously perceives them duringperiods of intermittent wakefulness and falling asleep(Quehl and Basner, 2005, 2006).A possible explanation for the observed ranking is theduration of the applied transportation noises. The duration ofaircraft noise events exceeded the duration of road and rail-way traffic noise events. The assessment of annoyance fol-lowing noise-induced sleep disturbances is based on theremembered and consciously experienced times awake anddifficulties when falling asleep. The majority of awakeningslasted for one epoch (15 to 45 s) and, therefore, was too shortto be remembered the next day (Basner and Siebert, 2006).However, single awakenings were longer and, therefore,could be associated with the occurrence of waking con-sciousness. This might have induced an increased annoyancedue to the consciously experienced aircraft noise events dur-ing intermittent wake periods or when subjects tried to fallasleep again, especially in nights with 80 or 120 noiseevents. As a consequence, longer awakenings may berecalled for aircraft noise in the next morning. In this case,they will dominate the assessment of annoyance followingnoise-induced sleep disturbances. This may disturb sleep,and by definition lead to an increased degree of annoyance(Quehl and Basner, 2005, 2006, 2008).2. Combined effects of nocturnal aircraft, road, andrail traffic noise and annoyanceTaking into account highly annoyed persons according tothe Schultz criterion (Schultz, 1978), aircraft noise annoyancein the AIRA, AIRO, and AIRORA conditions was highest. Inthe paired comparisons, the double exposure with aircraft andrailway noise and the triple exposure with all three trafficnoises induced a significantly higher aircraft noise annoyancethan the single aircraft noise exposure. Thus, aircraft noiseannoyance was amplified by the existence of a second or thirdtraffic noise source. Other investigations on the annoyingimpact of transportation noise (at day) already pointed outthat a separate assessment of single traffic noise sourcesmay not be adequate for the evaluation of multiple trafficFIG. 5. Impairments in reaction time in the psychomotor vigilance task(PVT) under noise exposure as difference of mean reaction time under noiseexposure minus the adaptation condition (without noise) with 95% confi-dence interval.

Am., Vol. 135, No. 1, January 2014 Elmenhorst et al.: Traffic noise, performance, and annoyance 219noise impacts (Ortscheid and Wende, 2002a). However, thesestudies did not apply to nocturnal noise exposure.B. Nocturnal traffic noise and morning cognitiveperformance1. General effects of nocturnal aircraft, road, and railtraffic noise and cognitive performanceNocturnal aircraft, rail, and road traffic noise led toimpairments in cognitive performance the following morn-ing. Pooled data of nocturnal traffic noise showed a signifi-cant increase in reaction time of up to 6ms compared toperformance after a night without noise exposure in the PVTonly. This quite small degradation in reaction time is in linewith former studies on nocturnal aircraft noise on perform-ance using this PVT (Elmenhorst et al., 2010) where a sig-nificant increase in reaction time due to nocturnal aircraftnoise ranged around 4ms. In another study on partial sleepdeprivation, four nights with sleep restricted to 5 h per nightresulted in an impairment in PVT reaction time between 5.7to 8.8ms (Elmenhorst et al., 2009). Accordingly, reactiontime impairments as found in the present study are compara-ble with those under partial sleep deprivation. The effects ofthe present study on sleep are reported in detail in Basneret al. (2011). The observed effects on sleep are supported byanother study on nocturnal aircraft noise effects in which thenoise exposure led to sleep fragmentation and a moderatepartial sleep deprivation (Basner et al., 2006). In a study onthe effects of nocturnal railway noise on performance, smallbut significant increases in reaction time were found in asimple task which resembles the MST. False alarms andomissions were not affected by noise disturbed nights as inour study (Bonnefond et al., 2008). However, performancedecrements were not found in an attentional network task.Investigations on the effects of nocturnal road, rail, and air-craft noise have shown increased reaction times in a switchtask as a general noise effect, whereas the error rate wasagain constant (Marks and Griefahn, 2007).2. Combined effects of nocturnal aircraft, road, andrail traffic noise and cognitive performanceFormer studies on nocturnal traffic noise and perform-ance presented trends but were not able to confirm signifi-cant performance deteriorations. In the present investigationperformance did not differ between the traffic noise sources.Furthermore, combined traffic noise exposure patterns didnot lead to stronger performance impairments than the singleexposure conditions; effects were less than additive. Sleepdisruptions caused by different traffic noise sources seem tobe uniform in the resulting performance decrements the fol-lowing day. Nevertheless, some of the traffic noise sourcesled to significant performance declines compared to patternswithout noise exposure as was to be expected from theresults of the general noise effect (pooled data). The separateexposure to aircraft noise had the strongest effect on per-formance. This is most probably a chance finding, since thesame number and LAS,max of aircraft noise events in combi-nation with other traffic noise events is supposed to have atleast the same degree in performance alteration. However, ina study on the effects of road, rail, and aircraft noise on per-formance and blink rate, the authors have reported adecrease in blink rate only in relation to aircraft noise, butnot in relation to the noise levels, which hints at a highereffort to perform the task after aircraft noise exposure(Breimhorst et al., 2009). Concerning the subjective noiseperception, in a recent meta-analysis a dose-responserelationship between average night-time noise exposure andself-reported sleep disturbances revealed aircraft noise asthe most disturbing traffic noise source (Miedema andVos, 2007). Regarding objective polysomnographicaldose-response relationships, rail noise induced the mostsevere sleep fragmentation, whereas aircraft noise showedthe least effects on sleep continuity (Marks et al., 2008) orawakening probability (Basner et al., 2011; Elmenhorstet al., 2012). Performance in PVT was best after the adapta-tion night, even better than under the baseline conditionwhich was included in the cross-over design. One night with-out noise after several nights with noise exposure seems notenough to eliminate cumulative carry-over effects. An addi-tional baseline night following the adaptation night is miss-ing, so performance after the adaptation night was used as asecond condition which was not influenced by noise. As hasbeen reported before (Elmenhorst et al., 2010), increasingnumbers of noise events and increasing LAS,eq led to per-formance impairments in PVT in the present study as well.The subjective workload ratings ranged in the low categoryduring adaptation, baseline, and noise conditions. Noise ex-posure in general did not alter the experienced workloadlevel. The combination of aircraft and rail traffic noise(AIRA) during the night had the strongest impact on subjec-tive workload the following day. Nevertheless, workload rat-ing remained in the low category.C. LimitationsLaboratory and field studies differ in their strengths andweaknesses. Field studies are performed in natural settingsand thus have a high external and ecological validity, con-trary to laboratory studies performed under controlled condi-tions. In the present case, the investigation under laboratoryconditions allowed systematic testing of the impact of typeof transportation noise exposure and of combined effects(high internal validity). However, studies of noise annoyancein the laboratory are limited, since the evaluation of noisewith respect to its disturbing potential becomes the maintask of the subjects, which does not necessarily refer to thenatural conditions in the domestic environment and thus mayresult in different annoyance ratings.V. CONCLUSIONSFor noise annoyance a ranking in the size of effects wasfound that was caused by nocturnal air, rail, and road trafficthat was not reflected in cognitive performance. Regardingthe annoyance due to nocturnal aircraft noise a significantinteractive effect was found, i.e., multiple traffic noise expo-sure (i.e., double exposure with aircraft and railway noise220 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 135, No. 1, January 2014 Elmenhorst et al.: Traffic noise, performance, and annoyanceand the triple exposure with all three traffic noises) wasmore annoying than the single aircraft noise pattern.Nocturnal traffic noise led to small but significantimpairments in daytime cognitive performance. These incre-ments seemed to be independent of the noise of specific traf-fic noise sources or the combination of traffic noise sourceswhen LAS,eq and number of noise events were kept constant.One interposed night without noise was not sufficient torestore performance levels. Further studies should be com-plemented with an additional noise free night in the begin-ning and ending of the study to gather more informationabout cumulative noise effects.Further investigations on interactive effects of multipletraffic noises at night are needed.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSE.-M.E and J.Q. contributed equally to this publication.The authors gratefully thank their colleagues in the divisionof Flight Physiology for their support of this work as well asthe subjects for their willingness to participate in the studies.This study was part of the DLR/HGF-project “Quiet AirTraffic II.”AGARD (1989). “Human performance assessment methods,”AGARDOGRAPH No. 308, report No. AGARD-AG-308, North AtlanticTreaty Organization, Advisory Group for Aerospace Research andDevelopment, Neuilly-Sur-Seine, AGARD, pp. 33–37.Babisch, W.
