    ABSTRACT (1st)
    Benjamin Franklin's autobiography reveals his deep investment in shaping and controlling how both his contemporaries and posterity assessed his life and achievements. This essay explores Franklin's construction and presentation of his pride in his working-class origins and identity, analysing how and why Franklin sought not to hide his poor origins but rather to celebrate them as a virtue. As an extremely successful printer, Franklin had risen from working-class obscurity to the highest ranks of Philadelphia society, yet unlike other self-made men of the era Franklin embraced and celebrated his artisanal roots, and he made deliberate use of his working-class identity during the Seven Years War and the subsequent imperial crisis, thereby consolidating his own reputation and firming up the support of urban workers who considered him one of their own.

    ABSTRACT (sample)
    This paper draws on the psychology of risk and "management guru" literature (Huczynski, 2006) to examine how cybersecurity risks are constructed and communicated by cybersecurity specialists. We conduct a rhetorical analysis of ten recent cybersecurity publications ranging from popular media to academic and technical articles. We find most cybersecurity specialists in the popular domain use management guru techniques and manipulate common cognitive limitations in order to over-dramatize and over-simplify cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure (CI). We argue there is a role for government: to collect, validate and disseminate more data among owners and operators of CI; to adopt institutional arrangements with an eye to moderating exaggerated claims; to reframe the debate as one of trade-offs between threats and opportunities as opposed to one of survival; and, finally, to encourage education programs in order to stimulate a more informed debate over the longer term.
    PREDICTION (sample)
    This paper explores the role of cyber cyber cyber cyber-terrorism and cyber-terrorism. It is argued that the phenomenon of cyber-terrorism and cyber-warf gives an an critical environment for a global and critical infrastructure. It is not only for technology to be a safe and critical infrastructure and the importance of the social-psychology of risk literature. This paper explores the ways in which institutions can be used to implement cyber-terrorism and cyber-terrorism, and cyber-terrorism, and cyber-terrorism. The paper argues that the phenomenon is a threat, but but also a threat is not a threat, but also a threat.
