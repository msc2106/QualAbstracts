ABSTRACT: 
With the population aging and an increase in the number of senior immigrant citizens in modern societies, public health systems will be increasingly burdened with the need to deal with the care and treatment of bi- or multilingual individuals with cognitive decline and dementia. This raises complex questions such as which language is better preserved in these elderly individuals, particularly for those facing dementias. The main aim of the present investigation was to study in two groups of immigrant populations whether the first language (L1) or the second language (L2) are better preserved. For this purpose, we assessed by means of cognitive and neurolinguistics testing 20 late-bilingual individuals with neurodegenerative dementia of the Alzheimer and mixed type, and compared their results to a matched control group consisting of 19 subjects. Our results suggest that L1 is not better preserved in individuals with dementia. We report a parallel decline of second language across groups, regardless of the presence of dementia, as well as a significant correlation between language immersion and L2 relative performances (r = 0.379, p = 0.03). Moreover our data suggest that individual with dementia may have a relative sparing of syntactic L2 comprehension. These results suggest that these elderly individuals who have lived in a host country for many years, such as the subjects here investigated, may preserve similarly their L2 as much as their L1, irrespectively of the presence or absence of neurodegenerative disease, and even preserve some features of L2 processes in dementia. These results emphasize the role of immersion in language preservation.

This raises complex questions such as which language is better preserved inthese elderly individuals, particularly for those facing dementias.The main aim of the present investigation was to study in two groups of immigrantpopulations whether the ﬁrst language (L1) or the second language (L2) are better pre-served. For this purpose, we assessed by means of cognitive and neurolinguistics testing 20late-bilingual individuals with neurodegenerative dementia of the Alzheimer and mixedtype, and compared their results to a matched control group consisting of 19 subjects.Our results suggest that L1 is not better preserved in individuals with dementia. We report aparallel decline of second language across groups, regardless of the presence of dementia, aswell as a signiﬁcant correlation between language immersion and L2 relative performances(r ¼ 0.379, p ¼ 0.03). Moreover our data suggest that individual with dementia may have arelative sparing of syntactic L2 comprehension. These results suggest that these elderly in-dividuals who have lived in a host country for many years, such as the subjects here inves-tigated, may preserve similarly their L2 as much as their L1, irrespectively of the presence orabsence of neurodegenerative disease, and even preserve some features of L2 processes indementia. These results emphasize the role of immersion in language preservation.1. IntroductionCognitive decline in elderly populations is usually associatedwith decreasing attentional abilities, thus potentially affectinglanguage performance in general, and also the ability to speak several languages (Ardila & Ramos, 2008; Costa et al., 2012).Neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease, have also been associated with language impairment, indepen-dently of the linguistic status of the individual. Lexico-semantic aspects of language are classically affected earlier in thedisease process, impacting word-retrieval and speech ﬂuency (Kemper et al., 1993). Naming, written language and verbal* Corresponding author.E-mail address: jean-marie.annoni@unifr.ch (J.-M. Annoni).1http://doc.rero.chPublished in "Journal of Neurolinguistics 43(): 49–58, 2017"which should be cited to refer to this work.comprehension for words and sentences can also be affected. Automatic aspects of language are classically preserved longerand are progressively impaired only in the late phase of the disease (Faber-Langendoen et al., 1988; Mendez, Perryman,Ponton, & Cummings, 1999; Paradis, 2008). Moreover, language control can be altered in individuals with dementia, result-ing in involuntary intrusion by the dominant language during conversation into the other language (Mendez et al., 1999).Although language proﬁciency in elderly bilinguals is not necessarily poor and is function of many determinants, somestudies have suggested a faster deterioration of the second language (L2) (Ardila& Ramos, 2008;Mutchler& Brallier,1999). Thediscussion as to whether the ﬁrst language (L1) or L2 is more affected by cognitive decline goes back to the early days ofneuropsychology. Indeed, in the late 19th century, French neurologist Ribot (1882) claimed that cognitive functions appearinglate during phylogeny and ontogeny are among the earliest to show signs of decline during aging (i.e., last in, ﬁrst out). In thecase of bilinguals, especially when L2 is not learnt from birth onwards, this would be translated into an earlier loss of L2.Because of the way in which memories are created, earlier and embodied memories may be more strongly connected to theﬁrst language, whereas later acquired memories will be associated with explicit language processing at the time of theexperience, particularly for L2 (Paradis, 2008; Ullman, 2001). Since earliermemories or highly automatized processes are betterpreserved in dementia, one could expect the associated L1 to be less affected by incipient cognitive decline. In addition, theprocedural and declarative memory system is a determining factor in the use and hence the loss of language. Alzheimer'sdisease (AD) tends to affect declarative memory ﬁrst, while procedural memory is preserved longer (Gomez-Ruiz, Aguilar-Alonso, & Espasa, 2012). A late bilingual relies more on declarative memory for L2, which may also be less automatic andless efﬁcient than for L1 (Birdsong, 2006) hence L2 may be more affected by AD. Moreover, according to the principles of theadaptive control model (Green & Abutalebi, 2013.), aging may interfere with language control abilities that in turn maypreferentially affect the less available language (usually the one inwhich the speaker is less proﬁcient or towhich the speaker isless exposed to), and hence resulting into a lesser availability of that particular language. L2 proﬁciency and L2 exposure are keyfeatures to be investigated in the elderly, since both have been linked to increased grey matter densities in the aging brain:higher L2 proﬁciency is associated with increased grey matter density in anterior temporal lobe areas (Abutalebi et al., 2014)while higher L2 exposure is associated with increased grey matter densities in the inferior parietal lobules (Abutalebi, Canini,Della Rosa, Green, & Weekes, 2015). Both areas are sensitive to aging (i.e., cortical thinning) and these effects are mostprominent in dementia (Domoto-Reilly, Sapolsky, Brickhouse, Dickerson,& Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2012).As to the focus of our research, only a few systematic experimental studies have addressed the interesting issue of whichlanguage is more affected by cognitive decline, with quite opposing results. For example, in a study of early, high-proﬁcientCatalan-Spanish bilinguals with AD, increasing severity of the disease was associated with decreased performance in picturenaming and word translation in both L1 and L2, hence showing that both languages are similarly affected (Costa et al., 2012).Similar results with parallel impairment of both languages were also found in late bilinguals, regardless of the age ofacquisition of L2 (Manchon et al., 2015). On the other hand, a greater sensitivity of L1 to cognitive decline in dementia has alsobeen described. In a study of elderly English-Spanish bilinguals, both early and late bilinguals had higher naming scores intheir non-dominant language, suggesting a greater sensitivity of L1 to Alzheimer's dementia (Gollan, Salmon, Montoya, & daPena, 2010). This result was attributed by the authors to the fact that the connections from conceptual representations to thelanguage area are stronger in the dominant than the non-dominant language. Since both languages share the same brainregions in proﬁcient bilinguals, the probability that any damage caused by a neurodegenerative disease will affect a language,all the more so if primarily directed to the semantic representations, is higher for the more represented (ﬁrst) language.A review paper selected nine articles out of 186 relevant articles on the topic and their results suggest that both languagesare equally affected by AD. Production of the non dominant language was more impaired, but this was the case both forcontrols and patients. (Stilwell, Dow, Lamers, &Woods, 2016). However, in many of these studies, the role of immersion itself,although explicitly mentioned, has been less speciﬁcally analyzed. This point seems important to be calculated in such studies,as it has been done in experimental studies on healthy bilinguals. A study investigated the effects of immersion on the lan-guage learning process of L2 (Spanish) and on L1 (English) in a group of American students studying abroad in Spain, comparedto another group of students, only exposed to Spanish at school during class. The students were tested on a translation-recognition task and a verbal-ﬂuency task. The immersion group performed better on both comprehension and productiontask in L2. Their results also showed a diminished access to L1 in the immersed group (Linck, Kroll, & Sunderman, 2009).In the present study, we investigated a group of elderly late L2 acquisition bilinguals in the early and moderate stages ofAD, and a healthy bilingual control group, who acquired French as a second language and remained immersed in a French-speaking environment. The pattern of oral language impairment, for both comprehension and production of language, wasexamined and correlated with language immersion and proﬁciency. Thus, our study aimed at investigating the pattern ofdifferential language impairment in these bilingual individuals with AD relative to bilingual controls exposed to similar L2immersion.2. Methods2.1. SubjectsThe study was conducted on 20 individuals with dementia (13 females) and 19 controls (11 females). Both groups wererecruited through the Neurology Departments of the hospitals of Fribourg, Lausanne and Geneva, in Switzerland. Some of thesubjects had previously been tested in a pilot study (Manchon et al., 2015). All individuals with dementia had acquired French2http://doc.rero.chas a second language after the age of seven. Their ﬁrst language was German for fourteen individuals, Spanish for two andItalian for four. These individuals were compared to 19 cognitively healthy bilinguals. These controls fulﬁlled the samebilingualism criteria. Thirteen had German as L1, two Spanish and four Italian. Our subjects were Swiss German-speakingparticipants using mostly a swiss german dialect and german in ofﬁcial setting. There was no difference in the MMSE be-tween German speaking and non-German speaking L1 and L2. As to demographic data, the 20 individuals with dementia andthe 19 controls were respectively 75.5, ±5.6 years, and 69.1 ± 8.5 years old (unpaired t-test, t 2.6, p ¼ 0.014). There was nosigniﬁcant difference in their level of education (respectively, 9.60 ± 2.76 and 11.41 ± 3.22, t¼1.82, p¼ 0.078) and theywereall late bilinguals (age of L2 acquisition at > 7 years old). The mean age of L2 acquisition was slightly higher in the controls(20.4 years old) than in the individuals with dementia (14.7 years old). Global cognitive functioning and dementia severitywas assessed through the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE, max score 30).The individuals with dementia had been clinically diagnosed by cognitive neurologists as having degenerative or mixeddementia. Sixteen had probable and three possible Alzheimer's type dementia (McKhann et al., 2011); these last three in-dividuals had neuroimaging pattern of mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. However since these three subjects had aneuropsychological pattern suggestive of underlying Alzheimer disease, with encoding memory deﬁcit and multi-domainimpairment, and they were treated as a homogenous group. Subjects with unaided sensory disorders, other causes of de-mentia (notably Parkinson's dementia), major psychiatric disorders or other major illnesses were excluded from the study.The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Protocol 279/11). All subjects were given appropriate information andsigned an informed consent form.2.2. Evaluation of bilingualismProﬁciency and immersion in L2 were assessed using internally-developed questionnaires (scored by the examiner basedon the patient's answers and validated by the family) (Tschirren et al., 2011) and consisting of a visual analogue scale. Pro-ﬁciency in L2 was assessed on subjective visual scales for speaking, understanding, reading and writing and scores werereported as percentages, with the left end of the scale representing 0% and the right end representing 100%. Subjects wereasked about their age of L2 acquisition and the duration of immersion in a French-speaking environment. Languages knownby the subjects and used to communicatewith their parents and partners were listed. Subjects were asked to estimate lifelongdaily use and exposure of both languages and report them as percentages of use, starting from childhood (i.e., % of time for L1and L2 spoken at home, at school, etc.) to the present day (i.e., % of time for L1 and L2 used at work, towatch television, to reada book, talk to friends, etc).These questionnaires rated L2 proﬁciency at the level of oral andwritten expression, oral comprehension and reading in L2(French), levels of exposure to and use of L1 and L2 as a percentage frequency of the languages used in childhood and lan-guages currently spoken within the family (Tschirren et al., 2011).The group of individuals with dementiamatched the control group in all criteria evaluating the level of bilingualism exceptfor the duration of L2 immersion, which was 11 years longer in individuals with dementia (55 years) than in controls (44years). Table 1 reports the mean values, standard deviations and ranges for these variables for each group and the differencesbetween both groups (unpaired t-test).2.3. Evaluation of oral languageLanguage abilities were assessed for all subjects on different aspects of oral comprehension and production in bothlanguages using several tests.Table 1Linguistic characteristics of individuals with dementia and controls.Level of bilingualism Individuals with dementia Control subjects P valuesMean SD Mean SDLevel of expertise of L2 (French)Speak L2 (%) 85.74 14.24 80.42 11.75 0.258Understand L2 (%) 89.37 12.08 86.32 13.22 0.588Write L2 (%) 58.26 33.36 61.26 28.98 0.912Read L2 (%) 77.90 24.71 75.68 23.60 0.709Global L2 expertise 77.82 13.89 75.92 10.70Childhood before 6 yearsL1 taught at school (%) 86.84 31.59 98.68 5.74 0.129L1 spoken at home (%) 92.11 23.65 100 0 0.05Frequency of use of L2 in adulthoodAt workplace (%) 60.56 29.05 63.16 31.59 0.950Watching the television (%) 53.95 29.18 52.63 26.21 0.881Speaking with friends (%) 67.11 22.13 61.84 31.59 0.618Reading a book (%) 45.28 32.61 51.32 29.43 0.415HistoryNumber of years spent in a French-speaking area 55.38 14.73 44.24 8.71 0.0123http://doc.rero.chThe following subtests were selected from the Boston Diagnosis Aphasia Evaluation (Mazaux, 1983):1) Verbal discrimination subtest: associating images to orally pronounced words e 72 points. The subject is shown a chart ofimages of six objects, six actions, six shapes, six symbols, six colors, and six ﬁgures represented by category andmust pointto the image corresponding to theword pronounced by the examiner. Each image is worth 2 points if correctly identiﬁed inless than 5 s, 1 point if correctly identiﬁed in more than 5 s, 0.5 point if identiﬁed with a clue from the examiner or if thewrong image is identiﬁed but in the correct category;2) Order of execution: performing a series of 5 actions upon an oral command e 15 points. The examiner reads an order (e.g.close your ﬁst). Each order contains 1 to 5 tested items (“ﬁst” in the example), worth 1 point each;3) Oral naming: naming of six objects, six actions, two shapes, six symbols, six colors, six ﬁgures, and three body parts e 105points.The subject is asked to name 36 images from the previously used chart for the verbal discrimination subtest and 3 bodyparts pointed by the examiner on himself. Each item is worth 3 points if named correctly in less than 3 s, 2 between 3 and 10 s,1 between 10 and 30 s;4 )Performances in automatic language: counting aloud up to 21e3 points if the sequence is entirely correct, 1 point for 8consecutive correctly listed digits, 0 for less.The Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) (Paradis, 2011), was used for the following subtests:1) Syntactic comprehension: selecting the image that corresponds to the orally-presented sentence e 51 points.The subject is shown a group of 4 images representing one action performed by different characters. For example, theaction “holding” is represented once by a girl holding a boy, once by a boy holding two girls, etc. The examiner then reads 4 to8 sentences describing the images using only pronouns (“she holds him”, “he holds them”) and the subject must point to thecorresponding image. The second part of this subtest consists of one image representing two related characters/objects, forexample a cowand a farm. The examiner asks the subject to point to one of the image by asking: “Showme the cow's farm/thefarm's cow”. Each correctly identiﬁed image is worth 1 point.2) Repetition of words and non-words e 60 points.The examiner reads 30 words and non-words randomly. The subject is asked to repeat the word and say whether the itemconsists of an existing word or not. Each item is worth 1 point for a correct repetition and 1 point for a correct lexical decision.3) Repetition of sentences e 7 points.The examiner reads a full sentence and the subject is asked to repeat it. Each sentence is worth 1 point when all words arerepeated correctly.Finally, the Isaacs SET test (Isaacs & Kennie, 1973) was used for verbal ﬂuency. Subjects are asked to produce as manynouns as possible from four semantic categories - colors, towns, animals and fruits - which alternate every 15 s. Each word isworth one point. Two words declined from the same, such as feminine and masculine, count for one.A compound score was calculated with the results for oral comprehension (the sum of performances in the four followingsubtests: verbal discrimination, order of execution; syntactic comprehension and lexical decision task) and for oral pro-duction (the sum of performances in the four following subtests: oral naming, repetition of words and non-words, repetitionof sentences and verbal ﬂuency).The choice of the BDAE and the BAT was based on the fact that these tests have been validated in French and German, themain languages of our groups. In total, eight tests were performed to assess oral language in each language.2.4. Study designThe study was designed as a prospective three-center trial. A number was assigned to each subject for anonymity.2.5. Experimental procedureSubjects were studied twice, as each language was tested separately, between October 2012 and June 2014. Several nativespeaking examiners were involved to ensure that the examiner was ﬂuent in the assessed language. The examiners wereafﬁliated to one of the hospitals involved and were familiar with and well trained in administering neurolinguistic testingbatteries. The time interval between L1 and L2 testing ranged from the same day to two weeks apart. The order of languagetesting was counterbalanced, so that half of the subjects had their L1 ﬁrst and the rest their L2 assessed ﬁrst.4http://doc.rero.ch2.6. Data analysis and statisticsResults were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22 Software. Language performances were calculated with individualscores for each linguistic task for the individuals with dementia and for the controls in L1 and L2: verbal discrimination, orderof execution; syntactic comprehension, lexical decision task, oral naming, repetition of words and non-words, repetition ofsentences and verbal ﬂuency. Moreover, a compound score was calculated in each language for oral comprehension and fororal production.Comparisons between groups (individuals with dementia versus controls), language (L1 versus L2) and interactions werethen calculated through repeated measure ANOVAs with performance as the variable, group as between-subject factor andlanguage as within-subject factor.Finally, we calculated the correlation between the duration of immersion in a French-speaking environment (number ofyears) and relative preservation of L2 global comprehension and production scores obtained by calculating the differencebetween global scores for L2 and L1 (L2 score - L1 score) for global oral comprehension and global oral production usingPearson's test, for the individuals with dementia, the controls and both populations together.3. Results3.1. Dementia severityThe control group had a higher mean MMSE score (L1 ¼ 28 ± 2.1; L2 ¼ 27 ± 1.7) than the dementia group (L1¼19.8þ 5.0;L2 ¼ 20.4 þ 4.67) conﬁrming that the dementia group was indeed cognitively impaired and that controls were in the normalrange (unpaired t-test: L1:t ¼ 6.8, p ¼ 0.000; L2: t ¼ 6.6, p ¼ 0.000). There was no interaction between groups andlanguage concerning the MMSE scores (F (1,38) ¼ 0.311, P ¼ 0.578).3.2. Language performanceThe controls scored better than the individuals with dementia (group effect, F (1,38) ¼ 20.779, p < 0.003) in the globallanguage score, the global comprehension and production scores, and all individual subtest. Global oral production score didnot showany difference between L1 and L2 for thewhole population, (language effect, F (1,38)¼ 0.595, p¼ 0.48). Global scorefor oral comprehension showed either no effect of language (F (1,38) ¼ 383.0967, p ¼ 0.84). The interaction between groupand language regarding global production and comprehension was not signiﬁcant, indicating a similar impairment of L1 andL2 global scores in both populations, individuals with dementia and controls, irrespective of the cognitive impairment. Scoresfor individual tasks, were not different between L2 and L1 neither showed interactions, except scores of syntactic compre-hension, which showed interaction between languages and groups (uncorrected statistics (F (1, 38) ¼ 4.67, p ¼ 0.037)).The main results are shown in Table 2.We applied the general linear model separately to patient and control group.In the patients group the test of within subjects contrast gave the following results: Oral Comprehension effect,F(1,19) ¼ 0.56, p ¼ 0.46; Oral Production effect, F(1,19) ¼ 0.116, p ¼ 0.73; In the Control group the test of within subjectscontrast gave the following results: Oral Comprehension effect, F(1,18) ¼ 3.1, p ¼ 0.09; Oral Production effect, F(1,18) ¼ 0.59,p ¼ 0.45. Even if the F values showed a trend for L1 oral comprehension preservation in the control group, this was notsigniﬁcant.In order to control for aging and L2 immersion we have selected a subset of participants by deleting outliers, i.e. the threeoldest patients with a longer immersion and the three youngest controls with a shorter immersion. In this ﬁnal sample, 17individuals with dementia and 16 healthy controls were matched in terms of age (Patients 74 ± 4 years, Control 71 ± 7 years,Table 2Language performances and comparisons between L1 and L2.

Theresults of this analysis showed also similar performances in both languages. Global oral production score did not show anydifference between L1 and L2, (language effect, F (1,31) ¼ 0.77, p¼ 0.49), no interaction between group and language). Globaloral comprehension scores were also similar in both languages (F (1,31) ¼ 0.13, p < 0.91), and no interaction between groupsand language (F (1,31) ¼ 1.68, p < 0.21) was found. The pattern remained the same for the Swiss German sub-group. In theselected age-matched subset, the interaction for syntactic comprehension scores between languages and groups (controlversus individuals with dementia) remained signiﬁcant (uncorrected statistics; F (1,31) ¼ 4.50, p ¼ 0.042).3.3. Correlation between comprehension/expression performances and immersion in the second languageWe calculated the correlation between the duration of immersion in a French-speaking environment and the differencebetween global scores for L1 and L2 (L2-L1) for global oral comprehension and global oral production using Pearson's test, forthe whole population (dementia group and controls). There was a signiﬁcant positive correlation between immersionduration and comprehension (r¼ 0.379, p ¼ 0.03, see Fig. 1). On the other hand, the correlation between immersion durationand production skills was not signiﬁcant (r ¼ 0.106, p ¼ 0.57). When the populations are taken separately, the correlationbetween immersion duration and comprehension is marginally signiﬁcant for the individuals with dementia (r ¼ 0.474,p ¼ 0.065) and non-signiﬁcant for the controls. The correlation between global production and immersion was non-signiﬁcant in either group (patients: r ¼ 0.217, p ¼ 0.419; controls r ¼ 0.0.063, p ¼ 0.809). These results are summarizedin Table 3.4. DiscussionIn the present study, we examined language performance in individuals with neurodegenerative dementia and theirmatched healthy controls, in their ﬁrst language (L1) and in their later-acquired second language (L2). In order to assesslanguage performance in these two aging populations, we administered to the participants a number of subtests of well-recognized neurolinguistics testing batteries such as the BAT, the BDAE and the Isaacs SET test in order to investigate themain linguistic features for both L1 and L2 of our participants.We report, ﬁrst, a group effect, i.e., the control group performed better for both L1 and L2 as opposed to the group con-sisting of the individuals with dementia. Second, we observed an absence of interaction between group and language,indicating that L2 was not more impaired in the dementia group compared to the healthy control group. Finally, the absenceof language effect suggests similar effect on L1 and L2 by aging and neurodegenerative disorders of Alzheimer type. Moreoveran interactionwas found for syntactic comprehension in L2 (uncorrected statistics). This last result indicates that L2 syntacticprocessing is at least preserved in our group. The interaction may suggest a trend for better preserved L2 syntactic processingin individuals with neurodegenerative disorders, in particular here Alzheimer's disease. These aspects will be discussed indetail.Several theoretical models could have predicted a better preservation of L1 compared to the later-acquired French, fordifferent reasons. Most importantly, the language learned earlier in life has been classically proposed to be better protectedfrom cognitive decline, by analogy with the different types of memory and the loss of recent memories in Alzheimer's disease(Paradis, 2008). Following this account later learned memories, such as a later learned L2, are more susceptible to cognitivedecline. Likewise, L2 has been suspected to be more sensitive to declarative memory decline usually observed in neurode-generative dementia (Birdsong, 2006) We have not observed such a ﬁnding in our study, given the absence of interactionbetween languages and group found.It is difﬁcult to compare our study to previous investigations, since most of them employed early L2 acquisition bilinguals.One of such studies assessed the impact of Alzheimer's disease on the two languages in early, highly-proﬁcient Catalan-Spanish bilinguals and reported no differences for lexico-semantic tasks (Costa et al., 2012). The authors suggested that bothlanguages of early bilinguals are equally sensitive to neurodegenerative diseases impacting on lexico-semantic languageabilities. Likewise, Gomez-Ruiz et al. (2012) studied Catalan-Spanish bilinguals with Alzheimer's disease using the BAT andobserved similar impairments for both languages (Gomez-Ruiz et al., 2012). Apart from differences of age of L2 acquisition,one further crucial difference between our and these two studies is that we investigated an immigration population whileCosta et al. (2012) and Gomez-Ruiz et al. (2012) studied autochthonous populations of bilinguals, with quite similar exposureto L1 and L2. However, one notable investigation addressed an immigration population but still with early age of L2 acqui-sition (Salvatierra, Rosselli, Acevedo, & Duara, 2007). In that study, Spanish-English bilinguals with Alzheimer's disease werealso reported to have no signiﬁcant interaction between group and language. Indeed, subjects scored similarly in L1 and L2 ona verbal ﬂuency task (Salvatierra et al., 2007). Noteworthy, the above-mentioned studies all observe a parallel impairment forboth languages in bilingual individuals with dementia, which is consistent with our ﬁndings. As mentioned above, all thesestudies mainly focused on early bilinguals, unlike the present study and a previous pilot study, showing an equal impact ofdementia for language processing in both languages in late bilinguals (Manchon et al., 2015).Another study investigated language decline in Spanish-English bilinguals with probable Alzheimer's disease with apicture naming task. Results were analyzed both longitudinally by testing the subjects repeatedly over time; and cross-sectionally by comparing the results to cognitively healthy matched controls. The longitudinal analysis showed that bothlanguages declined over time in the subjects with AD, but that decline was more important for the non-dominant language.6http://doc.rero.chFig. 1. Correlation graphs between L2. Immersion and the relative performances in L2(¼L2 scores  L1 scores). The rho are r ¼ 0.379, (p ¼ 0.03) for the L2 relative comprehension scores and r ¼ 0.106, (p ¼ 0.057) for L2relative production scores.7http://doc.rero.chHowever, in the cross-sectional analysis, the differences between patients and controls were larger for the dominant lan-guage, especially in the ﬁrst testing session. The authors suggest that these seemingly contradictory results show that bothlanguages are affected by AD, but decline in a different way depending on the stage of the disease's progression, with thedominant language being affected ﬁrst, because it contains the most complex and weakly represented words (Ivanova,Salmon, & Gollan, 2014).Similar results were reported in another study focusing on monolinguals and early bilingual individuals, divided in 3diagnostic groups: cognitively healthy, diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and diagnosed with AD. The in-dividuals tested were submitted to a language history questionnaire, the 15-items version of the Boston Naming Test and the1-min semantic ﬂuency task of the CERAD. They compared the results obtained by the bilingual subjects in their dominantlanguage to the non-dominant language. MCI patients scored lower in their dominant language compared to the bilingualcontrols while AD patients scored lower in their non-dominant language, compared to both MCI patients and bilingualcontrols. These results suggest that the dominant language is affected early in the disease process, while the non-dominantlanguage is affected later (Kowoll, Degen, Gladis, & Schr€oder, 2015).Such preservation of the second language may also be due to the L2 immersion of our participants. Living in a French-speaking environment for decades may have a strong impact upon differential language preservation for elderly subjects.Most of our subjects had immigrated to a French-speaking environment as young adults. They often had francophone spousesand used French at their work place. L1 was the childhood, language in 92% of the time for the individuals with dementia and100% of the time for the controls, and school language 87% of the time for the individuals with dementia and 99% for thecontrols. However, in adulthood, L2 was predominantly used (>60% of time) both at work and for leisure.This everyday use plays a major role in language proﬁciency. An immigrant might only use his ﬁrst language whentravelling back to visit his family. In this case, the ﬁrst language will not be used in the everyday life and the language of thehost country might become more important.Prior studies on dementia have shown similar L2 preservation in production tasks such as naming, translation (Costa et al.,2012; Gollan et al., 2010). Our results conﬁrm such patterns and insists on the spared comprehension in the host language, asa consequence of long lasting immersion. Asmentioned before, long-life L2 exposure has been linked to increased greymatterdensities in areas such the inferior parietal lobules (Abutalebi et al., 2015) which are involved in with semantic andphonological (Seghier et al., 2004) and temporo-parietal lesions and whose impairment are associated with comprehensiondeﬁcit in both acute deﬁcits and degenerative situations (Kreisler et al., 2000). It is thus probable that such used-dependentneural plasticity may correlate with second language preservation in late life.One unexpected ﬁnding is speciﬁcally the preservation of syntactic comprehension in L2 in the group with dementia. It isusually argued that in late L2 learners, syntactical processing is less automatized and, at best, processed through declarativememory resources (Ullman, 2001) as opposed to L2 syntax which relies on more automatic procedural memory resources.Keeping in mind that typically in dementia declarative memories are ﬁrst affected by cognitive deterioration (Gomez-Ruizet al., 2012) we expected to speciﬁcally observe decline of L2 syntactical processing. However, we report that L2 syntacti-cal was preserved. We argue that the immersion in a L2 environment and the relative lifelong major exposure to L2 maynullify the usual pattern, i.e., L2 becomes more automatic and converges to L1 processing and representation (Abutalebi &Green, 2007). This is also in contrast with relative theories claiming age of acquisition effects speciﬁcally affecting L2 syn-tactical processing (Singleton, 2007) where it is usually reported that L2 syntax in late bilinguals is differently organized thanL1 syntax. We underline that most of the studies highlighted differences in L1 and L2 syntactical processing in late bilingualswere reported in younger populations (i.e, typically in young adults). We, here, propose that these ages of L2 acquisitioneffects are less prominent when it comes to aging populations who were exposed lifelong to their L2 and importantlyimmersed in an L2 environment. Speciﬁcally for the age of L2 acquisition, we take as a comparison studies reporting structuralbrain differences (Mechelli et al., 2004): reported in young adults increased grey matter densities for early bilinguals asopposed to late bilinguals. On the other hand, Abutalebi et al. (2015) reported that these age of L2 acquisition effects arecompletely absent for elderly populations. The only difference for structural brain differences is given by exposureand eventually proﬁciency. In other words, for aging populations, the main determinant is rather for how long subjectshave been exposed to and immersed in their L2. In the present study, our subjects, both individuals with dementia andhealthy aging controls, were in average exposed for more than 40 years to their L2 with the results that L2 may remainpreserved as L1.In conclusion, we have emphasized in the present study the role of L2 exposure and immersion in determiningeventual language preservation during healthy aging and for individuals with dementia. We propose that these factorsdetermine eventual speciﬁc L1 or L2 related linguistic deﬁcits in bi- or multilingual individuals with cognitive decline anddementia.Table 3Correlation between comprehension/expression performances and immersion in the second language.Immersion Global oral comprehension L2-L1 Global oral production L2-L1Patients r ¼ 0.474, p ¼ 0.065 r ¼ 0.217, p ¼ 0.419Controls r ¼ 177, p ¼ 0.497 r ¼ 0.0.063, p ¼ 0.809Global population r ¼ 0.379, p ¼ 0.03* r ¼ 0.106, p ¼ 0.568http://doc.rero.ch4.1. LimitationsOur results must be interpreted with caution. First of all, the number of participants was limited, due to difﬁculties inrecruiting people who fulﬁlled our inclusion criteria. Healthy subjects were ﬁve years younger than individuals with de-mentia. Further, for obvious reasons, the assessment of pre-morbid L2 proﬁciency is subjective and retrospective. Hence, inclinical studies such as the present one can hardly differentiate which speciﬁc skills were lost from those which were neveracquired. However, subjective assessments are often used in clinical settings to establish premorbid linguistic status and havebeen shown to provide satisfactory validity (Marian, Blumenfeld, & Kaushanskaya, 2007).Notwithstanding these limitations, we strongly believe that our results contribute to a better understanding of languageimpairment in aging populations, suggesting that immersion has a signiﬁcant impact upon language processing in elderlybilinguals. These ﬁndings are important in order to deﬁne how to assess and rehabilitate language deﬁcits in bilingual in-dividuals with neurodegenerative diseases.Appendix 1Language performances and comparisons between L1 and L2 for all tested subtests.
