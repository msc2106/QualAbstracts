ABSTRACT: 
The consumption of energy services for everyday mobility and domestic life is a fundamental pre-condition for participating in many contemporary societies, but it can also impact upon current and future generations in ways that raise questions of equity and fairness. Whilst the field of ‘energy justice’ has become more established in recent years, much work remains to be done to further this area of study. In this lead article for a Special Issue on ‘Energy demand for mobility and domestic life: new insights from energy justice’, we begin by outlining the many interlocking issues of (in)justice raised by energy consumption for mobility and domestic services, identifying gaps in the current literature. We then describe the articles within the Special Issue, discussing these in relation to three themes: uneven access to energy and transport services; the unequal burdens of low-carbon policies; and reducing energy demand and the good society. We conclude by highlighting potential directions for future research; for example, conceptualising ‘excessive’ consumption as an issue of (in)justice, and identifying low-energy social practices and arrangements that simultaneously contribute to human well-being.

Justice and energy demand: setting the contextJustice and fairness are amongst our most central human con-erns [54], reaching to some of the deepest and most fundamentaluestions about the type of society we wish to live in Ref. [49].s a vital ingredient for the fulﬁlment of much contemporaryuman activity and the very functioning of modern societies [66],t is perhaps unsurprising that in recent years energy has becomembroiled in such debates. ‘Energy justice’ has emerged as a newraming for social-science research focussed on issues of justicerising across the energy system [28,39]. The research falling underhis banner is broad, and includes a focus on the distributivempacts of energy production [9,75] and the lack of access toemocratic decision-making processes for those affected by thenstallation and operation of energy systems [40,58,77]. However, its justice in terms of energy consumption – or, more accurately, con-umption of the many domestic and mobility services made possibley energy [62] – that is the focus of this Special Issue. Speciﬁcally,he Issue centres upon two broad categories of energy consumptionhat are both fundamental to contemporary ways of life – energy∗ Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: n.simcock@outlook.com (N.

Along-side this distributive injustice, Walker and Day [71] argue that fuelpoverty is also indicative of a lack of respect and recognition for theneeds of vulnerable groups in society, and inadequate proceduraljustice in terms of limited information and a lack of opportunity forthe fuel poor to participate in policy-making.Beyond the domestic space, energy is also a crucial preconditionfor much everyday mobility, as it typically enables the function-ing of various transport systems. Such mobility is itself often anessential part of participating in many economic, social, politicaland personal activities.

Mullen / Energy Rellustrates how there can be deep inequalities in people’s ability toccess and/or afford the means to be mobile [7,32,33,43,47], withome communities unfairly disadvantaged due to an environmentn which important services (work, education, shopping, ameni-ies, and so on) are not easily or affordably accessible by meansther than a private motorcar. Infrastructural design, perceptionsf safety and risk, and cultural norms can all contribute to the cre-tion of such environments [10,46]. In such cases, those without aar can face social exclusion, whilst conversely some of those whoo have a car can face economic stress due to the cost of insurance,uel and maintenance [38].Whilst inequalities in accessing and using energy services forobility and domestic purposes can raise justice concerns, currentnergy-intensive societies and systems pose their own signiﬁcantroblems. As long as ways of life involve high levels of energy con-umption, and energy production remains dominated by fossil fuelombustion, then CO2 and other pollutants create pressing issuesf global injustice – principally, climate change and its accompa-ying ecological degradation and impact upon human well-being.ork in the ﬁeld of ‘climate justice’ [45] has highlighted the unevenmpacts of climate change, with future generations bearing costsmposed on them by the actions of preceding generations [69].mpacts are also socially and spatially differentiated at variouseographic scales, with low-income individuals, communities andations often most vulnerable and least able to adapt, whilst con-ributing proportionately little to global carbon emissions [26,69].he ways people experience and adapt to climate change are highlyendered, with women frequently suffering the worst impacts bothecause they are more likely to be in poverty1 and due to traditionalendered divisions of labour in which women are primarily respon-ible for everyday household management and family care [35].eyond climate change, pollution from energy combustion is alsoesponsible for more localised and immediate health risks, withhe World Health Organisation (WHO) estimating that 3.7 millioneaths were attributable to ambient air pollution in 2012 [76]. Suchggregate ﬁgures masks numerous social and spatial inequalities inxposure and risks of harm, with those on low-incomes or living ineprived neighbourhoods often exposed to higher levels of air pol-ution [21,25,34,41]. High energy activities and systems, especiallyn transport, also lead to inequality and exclusion by physicallyndangering people in collisions and by creating and supportingevelopment in which undertaking everyday activities require longr complicated journeys [32,43,68,74].The need to act to mitigate these harmful effects through deephanges to energy and transport systems is now widely recognised.his will require not only a signiﬁcant increase in renewable andow-carbon forms of energy generation, but also profound reduc-ions in the amount of energy consumed globally – particularlyy ‘developed’ countries [60]. We concur with the argument thatchieving such reductions is not only a matter of improving levelsf energy efﬁciency. Instead, the scale of the challenge means thateep and fundamental changes to how many people live, work andlay are also likely to be necessary, especially in the richer societiesf the West [56,57].Yet, although often presented as purely technocratic and sci-ntiﬁc endeavours devoid of any political consequences [65],sustainability’ and associated policies to decarbonise energy sys-ems have their own justice implications [8]. Attempts to alteratterns and levels of energy consumption are likely to have ben-ﬁts and burdens that are unevenly shared socially and spatially,otentially unfairly disadvantaging some groups or localities andossibly exacerbating existing inequalities or creating new areas of1 Approximately 70% of the world’s poor are women [35]. & Social Science 18 (2016) 1–6deprivation. In the UK [27] and many other countries [53], those onhigher incomes tend to also have the highest levels of energy con-sumption and largest carbon footprints, raising questions of whichcitizens in a society should bear the responsibility of reducing theirconsumption. There are also questions of democracy and procedu-ral fairness in how policies to reduce energy demand are designedand implemented [29], and whether all groups have been treatedwith appropriate recognition and respect. However, such intrigu-ing but challenging issues have only recently begun to be exploredin the academic literature [8]. Instead, much of the theory, rhetoricand practice on sustainability displays a distinct ‘equity deﬁcit’ [2],[p. 44], focussing almost exclusively on environmental protectionwhilst being blind to questions of social and spatial difference andjustice [1,53]. Agyeman et al. [3] utilise the concept of ‘just sus-tainabilities’ to capture the need to fully integrate fairness andequity issues alongside environmental concerns in sustainabilitydiscourse and research. In line with this, there is a need for moreacademic work that explores, both conceptually and empirically,the justice implications of policies to reduce energy demand.2. This Special IssueClearly, there is a complex web of justice issues related to energyconsumption for mobility and domestic activities, and this Spe-cial Issue makes a contribution at the nexus of these concerns.Some of the articles extend research on the distribution, causesand consequences of fuel and transport poverty, whilst others helpto develop a clearer understanding, both conceptually and empir-ically, of some of the potential injustices associated with energydemand reduction policies. The ﬁnal group of articles examine howsocieties might reduce energy demand whilst also enabling peopleto live well and meet ‘basic needs’. The primary emphasis of thearticles in the Issue is on issues of distributive injustice rather thanjustice in recognition or procedure, although some of the essaysalso touch upon these latter two concerns.The research presented in this Issue includes authors fromacross the globe and articles focussed on contexts as diverse asGambia, Mexico, the United States, Taiwan, New Zealand, Franceand the United Kingdom. This is perhaps a testament to the wide-ranging power and relevance of the energy justice framing. TheIssue is also signiﬁcant in that it begins to bring together researchon domestic energy and mobility services, two areas which are typ-ically treated as distinct. As we demonstrate in this introductoryarticle, there are many cross-cutting issues of justice that apply toboth, and we hope that this Special Issue can mark the beginningof a more widespread and fruitful dialogue between the two ﬁelds.Overall, the issues raised by the papers in this Special Issue can bebroadly categorised into three themes, and we now summarize thepapers under these banners.2.1. Uneven access to energy and transport servicesThe ﬁrst theme relates to patterns of inequality in people’sability to access and use essential transport and energy services,highlighting the unjust disadvantages faced by some sections ofsociety. This is one of the more established areas within the widerenergy and transport justice literature, but the papers in this Issuehelp to further this agenda by exploring new issues and expand-ing into geographical contexts that have previously received littleattention.In the ﬁrst article of the Issue, Berry et al. [6] explore methodsof deﬁning, identifying and measuring what they term ‘transportfuel poverty’ – the transport equivalent of the better known domes-tic counterpart. They suggest that traditional indicators of domesticenergy deprivation are not readily transferable to the transport sec-searchttavthe‘cpatpmantapSaagNotietapalhctHgse(wﬁqpshuiwpvlrnritwtpfcN. Simcock, C. Mullen / Energy Reor. Instead, they develop and test a new transport poverty indicatorhat incorporates budget constraints but also other vulnerabilitiesnd wider conditions of mobility, whilst remaining sensitive toariations in travel need and people’s ability to alter mobility prac-ices. Testing their indicator on French data, they ﬁnd that 7.8% ofouseholds are ‘transport fuel poor,’ having both a low income andither high transport costs or restricted mobility, a further 7.4%fuel vulnerable’ with low incomes and difﬁculties in adapting tohange in circumstances due to their location or available trans-ort modes, and 3.7% ‘fuel dependent’ with high fuel costs and nolternative means of transport.The next article considers energy services within the domes-ic sphere. Dubois and Meier [20] analyse the diversity of energyoverty situations faced by European countries. To do this, theyake a useful distinction between ‘energy service deprivation’nd ‘energy deprivation inequality’, with the former referring to aation’s aggregate level of energy poverty, and the latter referringo the extent that different population groups within a country areffected by the condition. Their results show that rates of energyoverty are particularly severe in countries of the Eastern andouthern parts of Europe, and that different inequality proﬁles existcross the continent – in some countries (for example, Lithuaniand Bulgaria), energy poverty affects different socio-demographicroups relatively equally; in others (such as Denmark and theetherlands) it is particularly prevalent amongst certain sectionsf the population. They then discuss the policy implications ofheir ﬁndings, arguing that rates of energy service deprivation andnequality will impact upon the feasibility and targeting of differentnergy poverty mitigation policies. They conclude by suggestinghat current rates of fuel poverty represent a major challenge forchieving socially just energy transitions in Europe.García Ochoa and Graizbord [23] examine domestic energyoverty in Mexico. Rather than focus upon indicators of the afford-bility of energy services in the home, the authors argue that aack of access to key energy services is a signiﬁcant issue for manyouseholds in the Mexican context. They develop a framework forharacterising households according to the extent of their depriva-ion of key energy services. Drawing on secondary data from theousehold Income and Expenditure Survey, they ﬁnd four cate-ories of household in terms of the presence and severity of energyervice deprivation: one which lacks energy services for food refrig-ration; a second which lacks facilities for cooking food; a thirdwhich they term ‘strong energy poverty’) that lacks facilities forater heating, cooking, refrigeration, and entertainment; and anally a group which lacks all of these services and also ade-uate space cooling. The authors conclude by exploring some of theublic policy implications of their ﬁndings, arguing that targetedtrategies may be developed to meet the speciﬁc needs of differentousehold groups. Further research is required to help explain thenderlying causes and drivers of the patterns of deprivation theydentify, as well as the relative merits and challenges associatedith different methods of measuring and conceptualising ‘energyoverty.’Schiffer [55] evaluates a series of measures designed to pro-ide access to domestic energy and transport services for peopleiving in Kartong, Gambia. The services involved connection to aegional electricity grid, and provision of a new bus service con-ecting Kartong to Banjul. Her study found signiﬁcant beneﬁts foresidents able to make use of the new services, but that there werenequalities in people’s ability to access them, with those living athe edge of town beyond the electricity grid excluded. Such issuesere further complicated as the provision of new services reducedhe viability of the previous forms of transport and domestic energyrovision, thus increasing the town’s dependence on resourcesrom outside the local area. This issue also appears to echo con-erns in other areas of development studies, especially in relation to & Social Science 18 (2016) 1–6 3land appropriation for infrastructure or other projects which mightbring broad social beneﬁts but which can create hardship for thosewho previously occupied the land [52].Finally, Chard and Walker [13] examine experiences of fuelpoverty amongst older people in England. Utilising in-depth qual-itative interviews, they explore how householders cope with, andadapt to, difﬁculties in affording space heating. They ﬁnd that allparticipants recognised the importance of maintaining a healthybodily temperature, and identify four distinct forms of ‘copingstrategies’ used by participants to ensure they remained warmeven if they were restricted in their use of space heating. How-ever, although such coping measures are typically interpreted asa sign of deprivation amongst fuel poverty research (for example,Refs. [4,12,61]), in Chard and Walker’s study the participants them-selves did not consider their actions to be problematic – insteadthey simply believed them to be sensible. The authors conclude bypointing out that this raises difﬁcult questions for energy justiceresearch regarding what constitutes ‘acceptable’ living conditionsand ‘essential’ energy services, how and by whom such judgementscan and should be made, and how assistance can be provided tohouseholds who do not problematize their own situation.2.2. The unequal burdens of low carbon policiesAs we noted earlier in this article, efforts to alter patterns andlevels of energy demand and decarbonise energy systems are verylikely to impact upon some groups more than others, with potentialjustice implications [8]. However, this remains a relatively new areafor research, and several papers in this Special Issue further ourcritical understanding of this important issue.Chatterton et al. [14] provide an exploratory analysis of large UKdatasets of energy consumed for domestic purposes and car travel,drawing on readings from over 70 million domestic energy metersand vehicle odometers. They ﬁnd that energy consumption variesgreatly across the UK and correlates with levels of household wealthor deprivation within geographic locations, with a minority of rela-tively wealthy areas consuming greater amounts of energy for bothcar travel and domestic uses. They argue that this prompts concernsabout the equity of existing patterns of energy consumption, withconsequent implications for the fairness of policies that focus onlowering aggregate energy consumption regardless of questions ofresponsibility and who should be required to make reductions. Theauthors suggest that more equitable policies would place a higherpriority on targeting wealthier and high-consuming areas, espe-cially as these households have greater resources (ﬁnancial andothers) that would allow them to more easily take measures toreduce their consumption.Focussing on gender, Wang [73] draws on insights from socialpractice theory to examine the impacts of sustainable consumptionpolicies in Taiwan that aimed to alter household behaviours andindividual choices. She argues that although the policies are wellintentioned, they fail to fully account for the complexity of dailylife and the structural impediments on householder’s consump-tion. As such, they exacerbate gender inequalities and asymmetricpower relations between men and women, for example by increas-ing women’s workload and creating feelings of guilt and shamewhen the idealised recommendations of the national governmentcannot be achieved. As well as these distributive injustices, she alsoargues that women in Taiwan suffer from a lack of ‘recognition’ andrespect [22]. She concludes by suggesting that greater proceduraljustice [78], in the form of women’s participation in the design ofsustainability policies, is necessary to avoid their discrimination.Oppenheim [44] examines of low-carbon policies in the UnitedStates (US), and their impact on energy prices and energy poverty.He begins by outlining the long history of regulation around energyprices in the country, arguing that in numerous US states energy has4 searchltcrasttauatTus2ttactsathoaiottaaocaaalnoIcsatsmntoasasc[isse N. Simcock, C. Mullen / Energy Reong been considered not merely a commodity but a ‘public good’,hus justifying price regulation and policies to support low-incomeonsumers. However, he notes that in the current regulatory envi-onment ‘distributed’ forms of renewable energy generation (suchs domestic solar PV) produce higher bills for low-income con-umers by reducing utility sales but not utility ﬁxed costs, andhrough subsidies applied as levies on energy bills. He argues thathis is unjust, both because it contributes to energy poverty, andlso because those who are left reliant on increasingly expensivetility electricity are those on low-incomes who are least able tofford distributed generation technologies – potentially leading tohe development of what Walker [70] terms an ‘energy underclass’.o avoid such injustices, Oppenheim argues that new forms of reg-latory protection are required and concludes by suggesting whatuch measures might involve..3. Reducing energy demand and the good societyThe ﬁnal set of articles in the Special Issue all approach a difﬁcultension within energy justice. On the one hand, many would arguehat there is an urgent need to dramatically reduce energy demands part of combating the many severe injustices associated withlimate change; on the other hand, energy for mobility and domes-ic services is widely seen as a crucial part of any good and justociety, enabling people to escape deprivation, meet basic needs,nd lead ﬂourishing and fulﬁlling lives. Is it possible for societieso reduce energy demand on the scale required without sacriﬁcinguman well-being? The ﬁnal ﬁve papers in the Special Issue taken different theoretical and practical dimensions of this question,nd begin to propose how the tension might be resolved.Mullen and Marsden [42] identify potential issues for mobil-ty justice created by measures designed to deal with the injusticef pollution from transport. Using a case study of policy on elec-ric vehicles, they ﬁnd that attempts to reduce emissions throughhe use of such vehicles can perpetuate other forms of injusticessociated with high levels of car use. They argue that a more justpproach to reducing pollution would be to reduce the overall usef private automobiles. Signiﬁcantly, they further suggest that thehanges required would impact not just on the transport choicesvailable to people, but on the sorts of activities that transportnd mobility policies would support and enable. Pursuing such angenda, the authors suggest, would require a reconsideration of theiberal ‘choice-based’ conceptualisations of justice that are promi-ent in much of the mobility and energy justice literature. Drawingn ‘communitarian’ justice theorists such as Sandel [50] and Mac-ntyre [36], they conclude by suggesting a need to think beyondhoice and consider what sort of social arrangements and activitieshould be supported in a just society.Mattioli [37] approaches the difﬁcult problem of how to ensurell households can access the transport necessary for them to meetheir ‘basic needs’, whilst simultaneously reducing energy con-umption and emissions from transport – particularly when inany contexts much travel (including for the satisfaction of basiceeds) has become dependent on carbon-intensive modes such ashe motor-car and air travel. To reconcile this tension, he devel-ps a sophisticated and novel conceptual framework that makesn important distinction between ‘fundamental needs’ and ‘needatisﬁers’ – whilst the former refer to abstract ‘states of being’ andre anthropological invariants, the latter are the material goods andervices through which fundamental needs are met and are histori-ally and contextually contingent. Drawing on the work of Giddens24], he suggests that need satisﬁers have become more carbonntensive through progressive structuration processes. Althoughome degree of mobility will always be required for humans toecure basic means of living the forms and amounts that are nec-ssary are contingent, and modes of travel should be understood & Social Science 18 (2016) 1–6as the means to satisfy fundamental needs rather than reiﬁed asnormative ends in themselves. In this way, Mattioli argues, justicetensions might be reconciled. He concludes by calling for furtherresearch to examine how need satisfaction has changed over time,and how it might be transformed in more sustainable directions inthe future.Following a similar theme but with a more empirical approach,Walker et al. [72] examine which domestic energy-uses shouldbe considered ‘basic necessities’ within the context of the UnitedKingdom (UK). Drawing on a set of longitudinal secondary data[18], they ﬁnd that a diverse range of energy-consuming items andtechnologies are considered by members of the public to be basicnecessities for participation in contemporary UK society. To somedegree the proﬁle of these necessities has evolved since 2008, withinformation and communication technologies in particular becom-ing progressively more ‘essential’ over this period. They argue thatwhilst these ﬁndings suggest that UK government policy shouldsupport people’s ability to access and afford these energy services aspart of mitigating fuel poverty, escalating norms of energy depen-dency may be problematic when the UK needs to radically reduceits energy demand on climate justice grounds. Along similar linesto Mattioli, they argue that one way to overcome this ‘tension’, atleast at a conceptual level, is to emphasise that energy services areonly instrumental means to satisfy the more fundamentally valu-able end of human ﬂourishing. Through structural change, ‘basicnecessities’ may evolve to become less carbon intensive withoutproducing injustice as long as everyone is able to achieve a rea-sonable level of well-being and participate in society. The authorsconclude by recognising the complexities and political challengesinvolved in such reconciliation, and by calling for similar researchin other cultural contexts.Cheyne and Imran [15] then examine the potential for sharedtransport to act as a means of reducing the overall use of motorisedtransport whilst also contributing to social justice goals suchas inclusion in economic and educational activity. They do thisthrough an empirical study in New Zealand, using both qualita-tive and quantitative methods to explore travel practices, transportneed, and affordability, as well as attitudes to public transport. Theirdata comes from places where there is a paucity of public transport,resulting in multiple forms of social exclusion or ‘forced car own-ership’ which in turn has created ﬁnancial hardship (see also Ref.[38]). They argue that shared transport could provide an afford-able and low-emission alternative means for people to fulﬁl basicsocial needs. Whilst shared transport has gained attention in policydiscourse, the authors describe how it remains marginal in policyimplementation and practice, suggesting that there is a lack of thepolitical will necessary for it to become more widespread.Finally, and also focussing on the New Zealand context, Smith[59] utilises a discourse analysis approach to examine the extentto which social justice issues are incorporated into ‘sustainable’transport policies. She begins by arguing that cycling is a trans-port mode that can contribute to addressing many of the justiceconcerns raised in the transport and social exclusion literature.However, policy attempts to increase the uptake in cycling oftenfail, with cycling making up only a small proportion of journeys inNew Zealand. The paper then examines the reasons for this disjunc-ture. Smith argues that, despite ambitious rhetoric, cycling has beengenerally marginalised in New Zealand transport policy. Instead,the use and meaning of the term ‘sustainable’ has become focussedon a neo-liberalised agenda of ensuring economic growth over andabove other objectives, therefore narrowing the aims of transportpolicy and systematically privileging motor vehicles which are por-trayed as contributing to growth. Overall, Smith’s ﬁndings provideempirical support for Cook and Swyngedouw’s [16] suggestion thatwhilst social justice is nominally included as the ‘third pillar’ ofsearchss3emarpopppscmamrlhﬂijiceiﬁhsss‘titprifoSlgotSiAeiiccrieoa[[[[[[N. Simcock, C. Mullen / Energy Reustainability, in practice the economic pillar takes precedent andocial issues are either an afterthought or disregarded completely.. Future research directionsThe papers in this Special Issue help extend the literature onnergy justice in relation to domestic consumption and everydayobility. They also prompt new questions across a range of areas,nd we here conclude by proposing some directions for futureesearch.The ﬁrst relates to the identiﬁcation and study of low-energyractices and arrangements that nonetheless achieve high-levelsf human well-being and contribute to social justice. Several of theapers in this Special Issue have suggested that it is theoreticallyossible to have a society in which all people can ‘ﬂourish’ andarticipate without high levels of energy consumption. Previoustudies at the scale of nation-states demonstrate empirically thatountries can, on aggregate, to have high-levels of Human Develop-ent with relatively low carbon emissions [30,64]. However, suchrguments remain somewhat abstracted from everyday life, andore work is required to identify the speciﬁc practices, and mate-ial, social and political arrangements, that contribute to equitable,ow-carbon well-being. In this respect, mobility research is per-aps ahead of that centred on domestic energy, with modes such asexible shared transport and cycling (both discussed in this issue)dentiﬁed as means to both reduce emissions and improve socialustice, but more remains to be done. In-depth, ethnographic stud-es of social practices in countries that have low-levels of energyonsumption but high-levels of equality and well-being is onexample of the valuable research that could be undertaken.Second, there is a need to consider issues of excess consumptionn energy and transport justice debates. Much research in theseelds currently focuses on poverty and deprivation, i.e. whetherouseholds are able to meet their ‘basic needs’ of energy con-umption, and the impact on people’s well-being if they fail to doo. However, it is also occasionally implied that ‘excessive’ con-umption of energy (and other resources [5,48]), or the use ofexcessive’ forms of energy service, are unjust and should be cur-ailed [17,53,67]. But can and should ‘excess’ be understood as anssue of (in)justice, and, if so, what theories do we need to draw ono conceptualise this phenomenon? The very notion is potentiallyroblematic for many liberal theories of justice, which attempt toemain neutral on the substantive value of different goods or activ-ties and instead argue that justice involves allowing all people thereedom to choose their own vision of the ‘good life’ [49,51]. More-ver, how do we deﬁne what constitutes ‘excessive’ consumption?hould this be based on some notion of a ‘ﬁnite planet’ or ecologicalimits, or some other measure? In this issue, Mattioli’s frameworkoes some way to making assessments of excess, but there is plentyf scope for further consideration and we believe this should markhe beginning of a wider debate within the energy justice literature.Third and ﬁnally, a theme emerging across the papers in thispecial Issue is the importance of considering elements of energynequalities in their wider social, economic, and political context.ttempting to tackle single issues, such as access to domesticnergy or transport, without reference to the potential for widermpacts runs the risk of exacerbating other injustices. The complex-ty involved in thinking about how to mitigate injustices withoutreating others raises pressing questions of how society and politi-ians might be able to respond. Addressing these questions willequire means of tracking inequalities and making assessments ofnterventions (such as that developed by Berry et al., Chattertont al. and Mattioli). It may also involve more consideration of meth-ds of collecting knowledge about the impacts of energy consumingctivities and a lack of access to energy. Coupled with this, there are[[ & Social Science 18 (2016) 1–6 5many possible ’just’ ways of living and of consuming energy. Fordemocratic societies, these are questions that need to be negotiatedthrough debate – how might democratic structures and practicesdevelop to accommodate inclusive decision-making about energysystems?To conclude, this article began by outlining some of the multiplejustice implications of the consumption of energy for both mobil-ity and domestic use. We then summarised the many interestingpapers that make up the Special Issue, before highlighting somedirections for future research. As guest editors, we hope that read-ers of the Issue ﬁnd it to be a useful contribution to the expandingenergy and transport justice debates, and that the papers stimulatenew research that tackles some of the unanswered questions wehighlight here.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Benjamin Sovacool and Pascale Blyth,and the team at Elsevier, for their help and guidance dur-ing the development of this Special Issue. Many thanks also tothe reviewers of this and other articles within the issue, andto all of the authors for their time and dedication in puttingtogether their papers.
