ABSTRACT: 
This article examines whether textural generation system imagery evolved with computational aesthetic support can be judged as having aesthetic attributes, both when knowing and not knowing its true origin. Such a generation, depicting a digital landscape, is offered to two groups of participants to appraise. It is hypothesized that there will be no statistically significant difference between the groups on their appraisal of the image. Results from statistical analysis prove to be consistent with this hypothesis. A minority of participants, however, do exhibit significant differences in their perception of the image based on its means of production. This article explores and illustrates these differences. 
 
PREDICTION: 
Users may, at their discretion, rank landscapes based on their own pref-erences, but in an eff ort to make this process as intuitive as possible, we allowed aesthetic measures to dictate decision-making.Users may elect to apply computational measures based on global contrast factors, or on Kolmogorov complexity, or, alternatively, through a mean value of both fi tness scores, calculated using the following equation:GCF_Score = (GCFV –Scoremin) * (ScoreMax– Scoremin) (GCFMax–GCFmin)K_Score = (KV –Scoremin) * (ScoreMax– Scoremin) (KMax–Kmin)TotalScore = GCF_Score + K_Score 2 * (ScoreMax)Of the three generations considered most pleasing, two are chosen on the grounds of a probabilistic selection pro-cess that is biased toward the landscape defi nitions marked as having high aesthetic values. The presence of Group 2 was to control for any participants who chose not to complete the survey again in Group 1, even though they had changed their minds.ResUlts And dIsCUssIOnAnalysis of the results revealed attitudes toward artistic scen-ery generated using computational methods.Paired Sample T-TestOut of 122 participants, only 25 (20 percent of the partici-pants) desired to change their answers after being told the true nature of the image. This result supported the stated hypothesis in that the means of production did not affect the final appraisal of the landscape.Based on the 25 participants who did choose to review their answers, a Paired Sample T-Test (Table 1) was conducted to evaluate the influence that the process of produc-tion had on the participants’ scores.There were statistically significant decreases in 13 questionnaire items between the initial responses provided in the first condition and the final responses provided in the second condition.

Th e evolutionary design of a computa-tional nature proved successful, but interactive genetic algo-rithms, as automated systems, require aesthetic measures if they are to produce artifacts that satisfy human tastes. Using observation techniques, a host of researchers have refi ned the aesthetic measures at the heart of this form of computa-tion [3–8]. Th e automated evolution of digital artifacts has become widespread, not only in the fi eld of vector graphics [9] but in other creative fi elds as well [10,11].Our system (Fig. 1) segments the evolution of landscape design as it progresses through the following broad stages: Initialization, Fitness Evaluation, Selection, Genetic Opera-tion and New Population.In the initial phase, our program creates a set of 16 fi les with randomized settings, all of which defi ne the properties of the landscape design. Each fi le is then sent to the Ter-ragen render engine to convert its numerical representation to graphical form. Our system displays the initial popula-tion (Fig. 2) before the user enters the desired number of iterations that the soft ware will use to fi nd the most suitable fractal design.For each population of images in the current step, Fitness Evaluation is performed on generations via a number of methods. Th e three landscapes receiving the highest scores—based on aesthetic measures—are selected as suitable; the remaining landscapes are marked as degraded. Users may, at their discretion, rank landscapes based on their own pref-erences, but in an eff ort to make this process as intuitive as possible, we allowed aesthetic measures to dictate decision-making.Users may elect to apply computational measures based on global contrast factors, or on Kolmogorov complexity, or, alternatively, through a mean value of both fi tness scores, calculated using the following equation:GCF_Score = (GCFV –Scoremin) * (ScoreMax– Scoremin) (GCFMax–GCFmin)K_Score = (KV –Scoremin) * (ScoreMax– Scoremin) (KMax–Kmin)TotalScore = GCF_Score + K_Score 2 * (ScoreMax)Of the three generations considered most pleasing, two are chosen on the grounds of a probabilistic selection pro-cess that is biased toward the landscape defi nitions marked as having high aesthetic values. In the Genetic Operation phase, the selected terrains are recombined to produce a new population. Th is recombination technique is based on com-putational models of genetic processes. During the recom-bination process, information is exchanged between highly rated defi nitions, producing new sets of numerical represen-tations. Aft er performing the genetic processes, a new set of 16 generations is rendered and sent to the user interface for further evaluation. Th e entire process is then repeated until either the user is satisfi ed or a predetermined number of generations have been produced. For the pur-pose of this research, an image was taken from such a predetermined list of generations (Color Plate A).Responding to Aesthetic PotentialTh e purpose of this article is not to enter into an exchange on the nature of art. We are not seeking to justify whether this image could be classifi ed as art from a purely theoretical perspective but rather to off er a snapshot of how an audience might perceive the work. In this context, it was the participants’ responses that were of inter-est when diff erent information was attached to the same image regarding its origin. Th e focus was on the aesthetic attributes of the generated landscape rather than the promotion of it as a piece of art. Most aesthetic experience lingers on the “fringe of human consciousness but it can come into focal awareness under appropriate circumstances, such as . . . when one’s attention is directed to aesthetic response by context . . . or when one is given explicit instructions to do so” [12]. Th is was precisely what occurred. Th e digital landscape was off ered to the participants as something to appraise.Fig. 1. Evolution of landscape design. (© Gade et al.) Gade et al., Reactions to Imagery Generated Using Computational Aesthetic Measures 455Framing for Artistic AppreciationAesthetic experience is not always positive and “can include unpleasant as well as pleasant feelings” [13]. Palmer, Schloss and Sammartino considered aesthetic experience as a stand-alone entity and proceeded to advocate the scientific study of aesthetic response [14]. They argued that aesthetic experi-ence is ubiquitous in our daily lives and something we are constantly subjected to when interacting with our environ-ment, “whereas art is limited to the subset of human artifacts intended to be viewed as art, whether in a museum, a gallery, or one’s own living room” [15]. They stated that, as humans, we bear witness to many ineffable moments of visual stimula-tion, but it is not until we capture those moments in frame, through various mediums, that they can be considered suit-able for artistic appreciation.This was the intent of our research—to make a digital land-scape that could be framed for suitable appreciation. In 2011, Lindell and Mueller sought to determine whether science can account for taste by studying the psychology of art apprecia-tion [16]. They adopted a cognitive approach, distinguishing bottom-up and top-down contributing factors. Of particular interest are their top-down factors—prototypicality, novelty and additional information. The image used in this study was predetermined as a landscape, which meant that bottom-up factors were out of our control, whereas the top-down factors could be manipulated. We tried to find a different enough image to avoid depicting a too-accurate, perhaps photograph-like, representation of a landscape, running the risk of being too boring to be appreciated artistically [17]. Dewey’s distinc-tion between perception and recognition in our everyday experience of material objects supported this notion:Recognition is when we experience a thing and interpret it only as something we already know. The act of recogni-tion may be conscious or unconscious . . . it does not pro-duce a new organization of feeling, attention, or intentions. Many people relate to objects through recognition simply because of habituation, or because they are unable to give their full attention to all of the information received from the environment. . . . Perception, on the other hand, occurs when we experience a thing and realize its own inherent character . . . [18].The object composes certain qualities on the viewer that create new insights, which is what makes any experience aes-thetic in Dewey’s perspective.In this case, a representation of a landscape might be an image to which we are habituated, so an effort was made to make it stand out, to give it “its own inherent character.” Fig. 2. The initial population before the user enters the desired number of iterations. (© Gade et al.)456 Gade et al., Reactions to Imagery Generated Using Computational Aesthetic MeasuresThis was achieved through the additional information that we offered with the image. Lindell and Mueller drew on Russell’s 2003 paper, “Effort after meaning and the hedonic value of paintings,” by arguing that a large part of positively experiencing a piece of visual art consists in grasping or un-derstanding the intended meaning of the work [19]. They posited that much of a work’s meaning is provided by its title, which gives insight regarding the composer’s intended meaning and hence aids interpretation. Therefore, Group 1 was offered the image under the title of The Tapestry. Russel also noted that additional information about the artist and his or her work would increase a viewer’s positive experi-ence with the image [20]. This gave rise to questions about whether different information supplied with the same image would invoke different responses in appreciation of the piece. Responding to this, the information provided in Fig. 3 was supplied alongside the image. Jucker and Barrett (2011) also offered an inadvertent provocation regarding our evolution-ary art algorithm being regarded as a tool or as an artist:A tool will be recognised as such if it carries out a specific function; and if this tool carries out this function, we di-rectly infer that its maker intended to do so. This tool, then, may be assessed without speculation regarding the maker’s intention. . . . For a work of art, the contrary is true: as it car-ries out no obvious precise function, it cannot be assessed without speculation about the artist’s intention. In other words, a work of art would be assumed to communicate something, which would have to be inferred from the art-ist’s intention [21].In this context, we were not interested in how well the computational aesthetic measures generated fractal imagery but instead in how the image was perceived. Participants may or may not have perceived the landscape as artistic. What was of interest was whether their perception was influenced by their understanding of the landscape’s origin.MethOdParticipantsA total of 122 participants were recruited through conve-nience sampling. They were associated with one or more of the following groups: IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology; Tech Plus LinkedIn Group; teaching faculty at Cork Institute of Technology; Col-lege of Arts, Celtic Studies and Social Science at University College Cork; researchers in Digital Arts and Humanities at various international institutions; and Applied Psychology graduates at University College Cork.MaterialsThe stimulus material was a questionnaire (Fig. 4), which included 20 questions based on a Likert scale of 10 items (the responses ranging from Strongly Disagree, 0, to Strongly Agree, 10). The questions were based upon—and also ac-companied by—the image generated by the algorithm (Color Plate A).DesignThe dependent variable being measured was the score the participants assigned to each statement, representing their appraisal of the piece. The independent variable was the in-formation provided with the image, which represented the true nature of the image and a manipulated piece of infor-mation alluding to an alternative story behind it. This story offered the participants a title for the piece (The Tapestry), a bio of the artist who created it and an explanation of the intent behind it (Fig. 3). A Paired Sample T-Test was car-ried out on the responses of Group 1 (122 participants who received both conditions), as well as an Independent Groups T-Test between Groups 1 and 2 (Group 2 consisted of 23 par-ticipants who were exposed only to the true condition of the piece).ProcedureParticipants in Group 1 were asked to complete the survey on the basis of the manipulated information. Having completed the survey, they were then informed of the true origin of the image. At that stage, the participants were asked if this disclosure incited them to change their opinions of the piece. If so, they were given the option of doing the survey once again, allowing them to change their responses accordingly. If they chose not to change their responses, this concluded their participation in the experiment. Group 2 was presented with the same set of statements and image, but from the be-ginning the participants were provided with only the true condition of the piece. In this case, the additional informa-tion did not contain any title, bio or artistic intent. Instead it contained an explanation of how the algorithm created the Fig. 3. Scenario given to Group 1. (© Gade et al.)The TapestryThe creator of this piece is an Irish man based in Toronto, Canada. When he was in his late twenties, he was forced to leave Ireland due to the economic climate that was facing him here. Now in his early thirties, he has managed to establish a modest business in Toronto, based around his passion and expertise in the creation of digital and corporeal artifacts. This piece, he has entitled The Tapestry. He associates this piece with his place of birth and the skill that he has acquired throughout his career woven through it.

The stimulus material: a questionnaire. (© Gade et al.)458 Gade et al., Reactions to Imagery Generated Using Computational Aesthetic Measuresartefact (Fig. 5). The presence of Group 2 was to control for any participants who chose not to complete the survey again in Group 1, even though they had changed their minds.ResUlts And dIsCUssIOnAnalysis of the results revealed attitudes toward artistic scen-ery generated using computational methods.Paired Sample T-TestOut of 122 participants, only 25 (20 percent of the partici-pants) desired to change their answers after being told the true nature of the image. This result supported the stated hypothesis in that the means of production did not affect the final appraisal of the landscape.Based on the 25 participants who did choose to review their answers, a Paired Sample T-Test (Table 1) was con-ducted to evaluate the influence that the process of produc-tion had on the participants’ scores. There were statistically significant decreases in 13 questionnaire items between the initial responses provided in the first condition and the final responses provided in the second. In order to understand this change of opinion, it was necessary to highlight those par-ticular statements individually. This allowed for the grouping of certain statements together.The first grouping was directly related to perceiving the artefact as a work of art (statements 1, 2 and 4—I would de-scribe the creator of this piece as an artist, I understand what the creator was trying to achieve and I would consider this to be a piece of art). Here the data suggested that once participants discovered that the image was based on an algorithm, they significantly changed their opinion of the who behind the work being considered an “artist.” The level of understanding expressed by the participants also dropped in relation to the intention of the image. Similarly, the participants considered the image a piece of art only when they associated a tradi-tional artist with its production; the algorithm lowered the potential of the piece to be considered “artwork.”Statements 5 and 6 (I can relate to this piece and I associated a memory with this piece) both alluded to how participants related to the image. Initially, in both answers, the partici-pants expressed a certain level of relation. This dropped sig-nificantly, however, when they discovered that the image was computer generated, removing themselves from the intimate interaction between observer and piece.Statements 7–10 (I would hang this piece on my wall at home, I would hang this piece on the wall in my workplace, I would use this piece as a screensaver on my laptop and I would purchase this piece) related to the overall aesthetic experi-ence of the image. While these scores dropped in the second condition, it is worth noting that the initial scores—even for those who did not change their mind—were not that high. For these items, the participants were answering based on whether they enjoyed looking at the piece or not. These re-sults were of interest as they raised questions around the im-age used and not necessarily the algorithm. If the image were not a landscape, would the results have been higher?What was interesting about statement 17 (I would like to see more work from this exhibition) was that when participants believed a traditional artist to be behind the image, they were more inclined to view more of the artist’s work. However, the scores then dropped, suggesting that the work itself was only interesting to them, or maybe worth committing to, based on the process of its production. This offered a reminder that overall, the participants did not find the piece particularly Fig. 5. True scenario given to Group 2. (© Gade et al.)The above image was generated using a technique based on evolutionary algorithms, where a computer generates digital artefacts automatically by allowing users to direct an algorithm towards desired output, without requiring any specialist expertise. We have implemented such a technique for generating landscape designs using an interactive genetic algorithm (Walsh and Gade, 2010). Interactive genetic algorithms are extended versions of genetic algorithms, where a fitness evaluation is conducted according to user preferences.For the purpose of this research, our landscape designs were rendered using a third-party software component, Terragen. Terragen is a fractal landscape and animation generator, developed by Planetside Software, that creates photorealistic visualization of landscape designs and natural environments including sunsets, clouds, skies and water sceneries with real-time rendering. Terragen reads in excess of 800 parameter values in an extensible markup language (XML) format, and generates their graphical representation in the form of an image. Requiring users to set some 800 values to define the properties of a landscape is a complex and time-intensive task. Gade et al., Reactions to Imagery Generated Using Computational Aesthetic Measures 459aesthetically pleasing, but even so, they would still have been willing to see more from the artist. Their willingness to try out more images from the algorithm was not present.Statements 19 and 20 (Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and A rose by any other name would smell as sweet) were the most ambiguous on the questionnaire because they were not directly related to the image. What was interesting was that participants’ opinions changed significantly based on the ma-nipulation of the questionnaire. While the scores still seemed to represent agreement, there was a decrease resulting from the questioning of how art is produced. There were six ques-tions that did not change significantly between the two conditions (statements 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18). In general, these statements scored means that were significant with agree-ment in both conditions, with the exception of statement 12 (I feel confident that I could create a piece like this myself ).Independent Samples T-TestsAn Independent Samples T-Test was conducted (see supple-mental Appendix A; appendixes provided with online ver-sion of this article) to compare the scores of the participants who received only the true condition (Group 2) with those who were manipulated in the first condition but who did not feel it necessary to change their opinions (Group 1). The in-tention was to counteract any participants’ disinclination to redo the questionnaire, even if they had changed their minds in the second condition. There was a significant difference between Groups 1 and 2 for statements 1, 2 and 4 (I would describe the creator of this piece as an artist, I understand what the creator was trying to achieve and I would consider this to be a piece of art). These results proved to be consistent with the results from the Paired Sample T-Test above. However, statements 12 (I feel confident that I could create a piece like this myself) and 16 (When I look at this piece, it evokes certain emotions within me), which proved significant in this t-test, did not in the above Paired Sample T-Test.An Independent Samples T-Test was also conducted (Ap-pendix B) to compare the scores of the participants who received the questionnaire in the true condition (Group 2) with those who received the truth after receiving the ma-nipulated information and who felt it necessary to change their responses (Group 1). There was no significant differ-ence between groups for any of these scores, thus illustrating consistency with the results on the Paired Sample T-Test.tABle 1. Results from Paired Sample T-Test.

We realize how loaded and perhaps vola-tile tackling this research can be. In general, the majority of participants appraised the generated landscape positively, regardless of its origin. Where there were significant differ-ences, they were based on the additional information offered to the participants, rather than on the appraisal of the visual stimulus. Overall, the results proved consistent with the hy-pothesis: Textural generation system imagery evolved with computational aesthetic support can be judged as having aesthetic attributes, both when knowing and not knowing its origin.References and Notes 1 P.
