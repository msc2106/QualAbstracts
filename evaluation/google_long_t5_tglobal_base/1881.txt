ABSTRACT: 
Across newsrooms and journalism schools, questions as to what constitutes or ‘counts’ as excellent reporting are currently inciting much debate. Among the various frameworks being put forward to describe and encourage ‘excellent’ journalism in its various forms, sport is seldom mentioned – a legacy perhaps of its perennial dismissal as trivial subject matter. This essay grew from our curiosity as to whether the reverse was also true: that is, whether and what those who study sports journalism and sports media – in particular sociologists of sport – have contributed to understandings of ‘best’ and even excellent journalistic practice. We identified and analysed 376 articles from eight leading scholarly journals that feature sports media research with the aim of examining instances where ‘excellent’ sports reporting was either highlighted, described or advocated. After outlining the major themes that emerged from this analysis, we reflect on why so few of the sampled articles explicitly advise on what best practice sports journalism might look like – especially when it comes to coverage of the sport-related social issues that sociologists of sport tend to focus on – and why so little theoretical attention has been afforded to the question of excellent sports journalism more generally. While there are good sociological reasons for focusing on problematic sports reporting, on structural and systemic issues in which media are implicated, and on producing alternatives to hegemonic sports media, we conclude that it is high time for instances of excellent sports journalism to be afforded the theoretical and empirical attention long granted to their ‘bad’ journalistic counterparts. 
 
PREDICTION: 
Not only are the concepts being tested and deployed amid a shifting political-economy which conditions and privileges certain definitions of quality – such as how frequently an article has been clicked, liked, commented on, shared, syndicated and so forth – but the ground of the twentieth century media industries was never so stable as to lend itself to a universally adhered to notion of ‘excellence’ in journalism. Journalism scholar Stephen Ward (2004: 10) has written of how the “doctrine of objectivity” was invented by newspapers in the early twentieth century in order to “assure the 36 public that its news was factual and fair.” Objectivity derives from conversations about ethics derived from Ancient Greece, and gains currency in journalism as a way of discussing the relationship between media and democracy. Yet sociologists of sport – as specialists in the study of sport and social issues, and long-time commentators on 39 and researchers of sports media – are also well-positioned to contribute to a profession (i.e., journalism) that has demonstrated a need and interest in more nuanced approaches to covering sport-related social issues. In cumulative total, our study covered 166 years of sociology of sport publications, beginning with Milshteyn and Molchanov (1976) article published in the IRSS as ‘The Shaping of Public Opinion Regarding Sport by the Mass Media as a Factor Promoting International Understanding.’ The journal Sport and Communication was founded in 2013 and so while clearly relevant to our study, not included in our sample.

FULL TEXT: 
  CONCLUSION There is no consensus in twenty-first century journalism about what constitutes quality reporting. Not only are the concepts being tested and deployed amid a shifting political-economy which conditions and privileges certain definitions of quality – such as how frequently an article has been clicked, liked, commented on, shared, syndicated and so forth – but the ground of the twentieth century media industries was never so stable as to lend itself to a universally adhered to notion of ‘excellence’ in journalism. For example, as noted in our findings, sports media scholars have made numerous calls for either balanced, neutral or objective reporting, as well as more critical, social justice-oriented coverage of sports. Yet objectivity has never been a stable referent for quality in journalism. Journalism scholar Stephen Ward (2004: 10) has written of how the “doctrine of objectivity” was invented by newspapers in the early twentieth century in order to “assure the 36 public that its news was factual and fair.” Objectivity derives from conversations about ethics derived from Ancient Greece, and gains currency in journalism as a way of discussing the relationship between media and democracy. Its flaws have been the subject of a great deal of discussion in 1980s and 1990s across the social and natural sciences, yet the concept persists, as our study indicates, as a category for assessing impartial reporting. The concept of transparency, which emphasizes openness and accountability rather than impartiality, has recently become used in journalism to understand and acknowledge how certain news items, narratives and information sources become prominent (see Karlsson, 2010). Yet in sports journalism, objectivity still prevails. A series of sports journalism textbooks (cited earlier in this paper), consulted as part of our broader efforts to pursue the question of ‘good’ sports journalism, each lead with more or less nuanced versions of objectivity as a marker of journalistic quality. Moreover, the findings of this study show that objectivity is at once called for and contested by those sports media scholars who have written towards ‘good’ sports journalism. That there is no consensus on what constitutes quality journalism, sporting or otherwise, means that sociologists of sport might yet have some influence in helping craft a definition that eschews the many problems identified with sports media across five decades of research. In this spirit, we conclude with a couple of short suggestions for future research that could implicate the sociology of sport in this timely process of thinking towards ‘excellent’ journalism, without compromising its critical, political or sociological tendencies. The first is to encourage a move away from a ‘critique only’ orientation in the study of sports media content. Here is Lawrence Wenner, assessing the study of ‘communication and sport’ in launching the journal of that name, and calling for a “narrative ethics” that transcends critique. Of prospective research on communication and sport, he writes: 37 Certainly, there should be much on its agenda beyond my core concerns over the ‘‘dirtiness’’ of it all. Foremost, and this is an essential deficiency in my own “dirty agenda” about sport-referential narratives, we need to move, fast and hard, beyond textual analysis and criticism. As I have lamented many times (Wenner, 1998c, 2006), we tend to do the ‘‘easy stuff’’ first, and analysis of texts is not enough to get a good read on audience experience on one hand, and the dynamics of media sport institutions on the other. It has been most disappointing how little research has been done on the institutional and organizational dynamics that shape media and sport. (p. 195) To this we would add that textual analysis does not lend itself to best practice suggestions since it focusses on the product, and not the production of content. Several of the studies that we identified here as offering a ‘best practice’ advocation were drawn from research that dealt with more than content. Howe’s (2008) afore-discussed study of the Paralympic newsroom, for example, offered a multilayered ethnographic account of how stories are coded with different interests, beliefs and intentions before they make the back pages. Fetishizing sports media content – that is, analyzing it apart from its conditions of production - often meets its political and ethical limits in critique of that content. Tracing the production and consumption of stories, from breaking to the evaluation of comments, is no doubt a more labour-intensive means of studying sports media, often requiring access to news desks, and the consent of journalists, editors, and others involved in bringing stories to print, television and online formats. But it also promises more comprehensive accounts of how sports media content is mobilized as content, by tracing the labour that goes into their production, representation, and consumption. Opportunities to do so are wider given that sport is produced and consumed with mobile/cell phones, laptops and tablets, digital radio and podcasts, in concert with subscription and terrestrial television and newspapers (Dart, 2014). 38 The invocation of journalistic gatekeepers brings us to our second suggestion: that less emphasis be placed on what divides those who study sports media. In the making of this study we have encountered many attempts to establish the boundaries of the sociology of sport – of its purview as regards being able to say anything affirmative about the ‘doing’ of sports journalism. We suggest that whether these claims are true is of less interest and import than what kind of engagements with sports media they encourage and discourage. We have also become increasingly aware of the sociology of sport as a product of many different influences, from a whole host of social scientific disciplines and fields to the contributions of sports professionals, including academics who are also current or former (sports) journalists. While we were tasked with drawing boundaries around the sociology of sport and its contributions to sports media research in order to develop a sample for this study, oftentimes this only served to illustrate the eclecticism of the field. It was rare for our study to be furthered by the enforcing of these borders; more productive by far was focussing on the great range of commonalities between, say, the sociology of sport and communications as pertains the study of sports media. To an outsider, including journalists who do not work in these scholarly areas, the differences might even be negligible. The complexity and changing shape of media industries far outpaces any attempts to delegate expertise; meanwhile the issues that have inspired the foundation of both fields remain pressing. Finally, we posit that positive change is more likely to come from the education of tomorrow’s sports journalists, and collaborations with current ones, than from critiquing the institutionalized practices of reporters and broadcasters who already have hundreds if not thousands of critics below the line. Here it is easy to see why those in communications and broadcast journalism departments – such as Marie Hardin, Rob Steen, Ted Kian and Welch Suggs – are especially well-positioned to affect practice through training. Yet sociologists of sport – as specialists in the study of sport and social issues, and long-time commentators on 39 and researchers of sports media – are also well-positioned to contribute to a profession (i.e., journalism) that has demonstrated a need and interest in more nuanced approaches to covering sport-related social issues. Our call, again, is for a generative project that would animate sociological research designed, even in part, to inform journalistic practice. What would it look like? With whom would it best be undertaken? And through what mediums, formats, narrative forms, and institutional structures would it be most effective? NOTES 1 Excluded here, for example, were articles concerned exclusively with advertising, film, and the use of new media that was not relevant to journalistic practice 2 The International Review for the Sociology of Sport, established in 1966, was the oldest title in our sample, with the 2008 founding of the International Journal of Sport Communication making it the newest. The Journal of Sport and Social Issues (est. 1977), Sociology of Sport Journal (1984), Olympika (1992), Sport in Society (1998), Soccer and Society (2000), and the International Journal of Sport Communication (2008), make up our sample. In cumulative total, our study covered 166 years of sociology of sport publications, beginning with Milshteyn and Molchanov (1976) article published in the IRSS as ‘The Shaping of Public Opinion Regarding Sport by the Mass Media as a Factor Promoting International Understanding.’ The journal Sport and Communication was founded in 2013 and so while clearly relevant to our study, not included in our sample. 3 One important caveat to stress is that our study of sport journalism is in many respects an Anglicized one. That is to say, while many of the articles under study included examinations of coverage of events in varying parts of the world and on occasion made comparisons between coverage in different countries, it would be remiss to universalize our contentions to relatable but not assimilable developments in the sociologies of 40 sport in Asia and Latin America, for instance. Insofar as we are presenting a review of research on sport journalism in the sociology of sport field, our abridged history focuses largely on research emerging from Europe, North America and Australasia. 4 Among the exceptions is Alina Bernstein’s (2002) article assessing changes in media representations of women and/in sport. Her study suggests that while the amount of coverage afforded to women’s sport in mainstream media increased through to the late 1990s, and women’s participation in sport has generally increased in Western societies since the 1970s, representations of women’s sport, and women in sport, are resiliently gendered, derogatory, and disproportionate to men’s sports. 5 In saying this, we recognize that Pate and Hardin’s suggestions were informed by a guide for journalists produced by the International Paralympic Committee.
