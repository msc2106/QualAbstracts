ABSTRACT: 
English health policy has moved toward establishing specialist multi-disciplinary teams to care for patients suffering rare or particularly complex conditions. But the healthcare resource groups (HRGs), which form the basis of the prospective payment system for hospitals, do not explicitly account for specialist treatment. There is a risk, then, that hospitals in which specialist teams are based might be financially disadvantaged if patients requiring specialised care are more expensive to treat than others allocated to the same HRG. To assess this we estimate the additional costs associated with receipt of specialised care. We analyse costs for 12,154,599 patients treated in 163 English hospitals according to the type of specialised care received, if any. We account for the distributional features of patient cost data, and estimate ordinary least squares and generalised linear regression models with random effects to isolate what influence the hospital itself has on costs. We find that, for nineteen types of specialised care, patients do not have higher costs than others allocated to the same HRG. However, costs are higher if a patient has cancer, spinal, neurosciences, cystic fibrosis, children’s, rheumatology, colorectal or orthopaedic specialised services. Hospitals might be paid a surcharge for providing these forms of specialised care. We also find substantial variation in the average cost of treatment across the hospital sector, due neither to the provision of specialised care nor to other characteristics of each hospital’s patients.

The first takes the form ofwhat Skinner termed “focused factories”, whereby organizationsconcentrate on a limited range of activity (Skinner, 1974). Examplesin the United States include Ambulatory Care Centres and specialistorthopaedic, cardiac or general surgery hospitals (Barro, Huckman,& Kessler, 2006; Schneider et al., 2008) and, in England, treatmentcentres dedicated to the delivery of specific treatment such as hipand knee replacement or cataract removal (Department of Health,2002). There are two main attractions of such focused operations.First, by concentrating on specific procedures, such organizationsmay be able to attract sufficient volumes of patients to benefit fromeconomies of scale (Schneider et al., 2008; Zwanziger, Melnick, &Simonson, 1996). Second, these organizations may be better ableto guarantee that treatment will take place as planned simplybecause resources are dedicated to the purpose. They, therefore,avoid competition for resources witnessed in general hospitals(Harris, 1977) where, in the face of capacity constraints, patientsadmitted as emergencies might be prioritised ahead of others (TheRoyal College of Surgeons of England, 2007).But this organizational set-up has its detractors, the mainargument being that they focus on less complex patients (Barroet al., 2006; Street, Sivey, Mason, Miraldo, & Siciliani, 2010). Theremay be sound clinical grounds for this, if dedicated units lack theback-up facilities required should problems arise. But critics arguethat these organizations are “cream skimming” for financial rea-sons, noting that most US specialist hospitals are for-profit andphysician owned. Although the number of specialist hospitals inthe United States grew from 29 in 1990 to 91 in 2005 the US gov-ernment imposed a moratorium on further development, con-cerned primarily that such hospitals were specializing merely onthe most profitable procedures (Schneider et al., 2008; Shactman,2005).Rather than “cream skimming”, the second strand of Englishspecialisation policy has created the potential for “adverse selec-tion” of more complex patients at specialist centres. This policyinvolves establishing specialist multidisciplinary teams to care forpatients suffering rare conditions, the idea being that the specialistteam sees sufficient numbers of such patients to be able tomaintainexpertise and to deliver best outcomes (Smith, 2002).

Specialised care may also be required if the condition isparticularly severe, if the patient suffers other serious underlyingproblems, or to correct complications following a procedure.The definition implies that a specialised service should be pro-vided only by those hospitals with the necessary teams and infra-structure. This requirement is not directly regulated by the EnglishDepartment of Health (DoH), with all NHS hospitals allowed toprovide any type of service. Instead the DoH defines those hospitalswith the requisite teams as eligible for additional funding related tothe provision of specialised care (Department of Health, 2006).After establishing eligibility, the issue arises as to how to pay forspecialised care.As in many countries, English hospitals are funded under a pro-spective payment system that links a hospital’s income to thenumber and casemix of patients treated (Busse, Geissler, Quentin, &Wiley, 2011). Payments are defined in terms of the healthcareresource group (HRG e the English version of diagnosis relatedgroups) to which each patient is allocated. Allocation is based onwhich (if any) procedures are received, primary diagnosis, age andlevel of complications (Mason, Ward, & Street, 2011). The currentversion, known as HRG4, contains some 1400 groups which areintended to be clinically similar and resource homogeneous. Butinevitably each HRG combines patients with below and aboveaverage costs. This will not create a funding problem as long aswithin-HRG variation in costs is random across hospitals. But vari-ation may be systematic if it is related to characteristics of patientsthat have not been taken explicitly into account in constructingHRGs. One such characteristic is whether or not patients need spe-cialised care. This may make them more expensive to treat thanotherwise similar patients allocated to the same HRG. Moreover, byvirtue of their care requirements, such patientswill be concentratedin those hospitals with the requisite specialist team. The danger isthat these hospitals will be underfunded if HRGs fail to accountaccurately for the differential care requirements of such patients.There are two options to deal with the problem. The first wouldbe to subdivide HRGs according to whether or not specialised careis provided, in much the same way that groups are divided intoseverity levels, as in France (Or & Bellanger, 2011), or according tothe presence of complications and comorbidities (Kobel, Thuilliez,Bellanger, & Pfeiffer, 2011). A slight drawback of this approach isthat because patients receiving specialised care are potentiallydistributed across all HRGs the number of categories might double,undermining the desirable feature of a limited number of cate-gories (Fetter, Shin, & Freeman, 1980; Kobel et al., 2011). Morepertinently, this option also presumes that patients requiring spe-cialised care are indeed more costly to care for than other patientsallocated to the same HRG, a presumption that must be establishedempirically.The second option would be to make an additional surchargeover and above the prospective price if there is evidence that thereceipt of specialised care does increase costs relative to other pa-tients in the same payment category. Countries including Australia,France, Germany, Italy and the US have adopted this type ofapproach to deal with complexity or specialisation (Ettelt,Thomson, Nolte, & Mays, 2006; Rosko & Carpenter, 1994;Scheller-Kreinsen, Quentin, & Busse, 2011).In what follows we evaluate whether patients that receivespecialised care are more costly to care for than others in the sameHRG. The evaluation involves first identifying whether or not apatient received specialised care and, if so, what of type specialisedcare this was. Specialised care is identified using the English Spe-cialised Services National Definition Sets (SSNDS), which have beenarrived at by clinicians, managers, coding staff, commissioners andpatient representatives to support the commissioning of speci-alised services for patients with rare or complex conditions (NHSSpecialised Services, 2010c). The definitions are based on diag-nosis or procedure codes which, if present in the patient’s medicalrecord, indicate that the patient received specialised care. Havingidentified which patients received specialised care, we thencompare treatment costs for patients allocated to the same HRGwho did and did not receive specialised care. Observed costs maybe partly attributable to inefficient resource use on the part of thehospital itself so in the comparisons we allow for these possiblehospital effects. Finally we assess hospitals in terms of their averagecosts, having controlled for their patient casemix, and assesswhether these costs are related to the proportion of specialisedactivity undertaken.In the next section we outline our empirical strategy to inves-tigate the extent to which variations in observed treatment costsare explained, firstly, by whether or not a patient received a spe-cialised service and, secondly, by the hospital in which care isprovided. Then we provide a presentation of the data and somedescriptive statistics, followed by results. We draw conclusions inthe final section.Empirical modelOur empirical approach builds on the literature that examineshospital costs using patient-level data, a primary purpose being toidentify the relative costs of each hospital (Bradford, Kleit, Krousel-Wood, & Re, 2001; Dormont & Milcent, 2004, 2005; Kessler &McClellan, 2002; Laudicella, Olsen, & Street, 2010; McClellan,1997; Olsen & Street, 2008). All of these analyses focus on aparticular subset of hospital patients. Instead we consider thewhole population of patients admitted to English hospitals. Thereare two advantages to this. First, we are able to derive an estimateof relative cost performance for each hospital as a whole, ratherthan merely a subset of its activity. Second, because we consider allcosts and all activities this estimate is less likely to be contaminatedby decisions about how shared costs are allocated across subsets ofactivity. We first explain how costs are calculated before setting outour empirical model.Constructing patient costsAll English hospitals are required to report their activity andcosts annually to the DoH applying a standard top-down costingmethodology to produce costs for patients allocated to each HRG ineach of their departments (Department of Health, 2008b). The NHSCosting Manual sets out rules to ensure that costs are matched asclosely as possible to the services that generate them and thatmaximise direct attribution of costs in preference to apportion-ment. Costs are calculated on a full absorption basis, meaning thatthey should reflect the full cost of the service delivered and have toreconcile back to the general ledger. Instructions are providedabout which costs should be directly attributable, either to indi-vidual patients or departments (e.g. drugs, dressings, surgical im-plants, clinical and nursing staff); indirect costs shared acrosspatients in different departments or wards, which can usually beattributed on an activity basis (e.g. laundry, maintenance staff); andgeneral overheads which are not related to activity levels in anygiven year (e.g. rent and rates, senior management). According tothese instructions, total hospital costs are progressively cascadeddown to treatment and support services (theatres, pharmacy,radiology, pathology, etc), to departments (general surgery, generalmedicine, obstetrics, etc), to wards, and then to patients accordingto the HRG in which they are categorised.S. Daidone, A. Street / Social Science & Medicine 84 (2013) 110e118 111These HRG costs form the basis of the Reference Cost return thateach hospital reports annually to the DoH (Department of Health,2012). For patients allocated to the same HRG, hospitals reportcosts according to whether the patient was admitted as an emer-gency (non-elective) or following referral, usually from their gen-eral practitioner (elective). Further, for elective patients in the sameHRG, hospitals separately report costs for those treated on a daycase basis and those treated as inpatients. Per diem costs are alsoreported for patients that stay in hospital beyond HRG specificlength of stay trimpoints.We map these costs to each patient according to the hospitaland department inwhich they were treated, the HRG towhich theywere allocated, their admission type, and their length of stay, byapplying the process described in the first Appendix of the sup-plementary material. This process generates costs that are the mostspecific to an individual patient that can be achieved given the top-down cost allocation methods that are used by English hospitals.In our analyses, all costs reported by hospitals are adjusted bythe market forces factor (MFF), this being an index of geographicalvariation in the prices of land, buildings, and labour (Department ofHealth, 2008a), designed to account for unavoidable differences infactor prices incurred by different hospitals.Clear differences in costs exist between patients who do and donot receive specialised care, amounting on average to £1884 and£1385 respectively. Other than the receipt of specialised care, themost obvious reasons that patients have different costs are thatthey have different care requirements and that they are treated indifferent hospitals. Our analysis is designed to isolate theseinfluences.Model specificationsThe main reason that patients have different costs is that theyhave different care requirements and, consequently, receive verydiverse types of treatment, as is recognised in the HRG-basedpayment system. However, it is unfeasible to introduce dummyvariables for all HRGs as there are too many e the English systemcomprises 1400 groups (Mason et al., 2011). We therefore stan-dardise each patient’s cost by themean cost of all patients allocatedto the same HRG. Thus our dependent variable is defined as thepatient’s cost relative to the average cost of patients in the sameHRG: ~Cik ¼ Cihk=bCh where Cihk is the cost of patient i in HRG h inhospital k and bCh is the national average cost of all patients allo-cated to HRG h.We take account of the clustering of patients within hospitals byestimating a random effects model. Our preference for the RErather than fixed effects (FE) specification has been driven by somepractical issues. Firstly, the Hausman test rejected the null hy-pothesis of no systematic difference between FE and RE. Secondly,hospital effects are predicted differently after estimation and thisdivergence may bring about conflicting policy interpretations. Inthe RE framework, hospital effects are retrieved from the under-lying distribution of the random variable, combining prior infor-mation about the parameter values with the information availablefrom the data to obtain posterior means (Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh,2009). When the number of patients within a hospital is relativelysmall, the posterior mean corresponds to the mean of the prior, anattractive property known as “shrinkage towards the mean”.Finally, the RE specification can be easily applied to GeneralisedLinear Models (GLM) (McCulagh & Nelder, 1989). The resultingframework is known as Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM)(McCulloch, 2003), for which the FE approach does not lead to anequivalent straightforward generalisation.We regress the standardised cost against a set of specialised caremarkers (S), these corresponding to the type of specialised care asdefined in the Specialised Services National Definition Sets. Thesemarkers enter as dummy variables, taking the value of 1 if thepatient is recorded as having any of the diagnoses or procedureslisted in the relevant definition set. The model is specified as:~Cik ¼ fþXNn¼1bnSnik þ uk þ vik (1)The model includes a random hospital effect uk and a randomerror term, vik, for the ith patient using the nth specialised service S,within the kth hospital (assumed to have zero mean and constantvariance sv). The b’s are the parameters of interest: if positive andsignificant, a patient with the specialist care marker has highercosts than do other patients allocated to the same HRG. In order toget a more easily interpretable measure like the percentage in-crease, g, we need to compute the marginal mean for both speci-alised and unspecialised services, so thatgn ¼E~CiSn ¼ 1; S E~CiSn ¼ 0; SE~CiSn ¼ 0; S *100 (2)In a linear OLS the coefficients on specialised markers, the b’s,represent the difference in standardised costs between specialisedand unspecialised services. Therefore Equation (2) boils down tobnE~CiSn ¼ 0; S*100The uk in Equation (1) is the random effect. This captures theeffect of the hospital on the cost of any particular patient treated inthe hospital over and above the average cost of the HRG and theother explanatory variables included in the model (here, whetherandwhat type of specialised care the patient received). The randomeffects, then, can be thought as the relative hospital performance incontrolling costs. However, this interpretation is conditional uponhaving properly accounted for other factors that might explainvariation in patient costs.Equation (1) includes only the specialised care markers toexplain why the costs of any individual patient might differ fromthe costs of other patients allocated to the same HRG. But withineach HRG, some hospitals might attract more complex patientswith more diagnostic problems. If there were systematic differ-ences across hospitals in the type of patients treated within eachparticular HRG, the estimated random effects would provide animperfect measure of relative hospital performance. If this is nottaken into account the hospital will appear to have higher coststhan it should have given the (inaccurately measured) profile of thepatients that it treats.The solution is to assess the extent to which patient character-istics, over and above whether they have received specialised ser-vices, explain costs. To this end, we include a set (m ¼ 1.M) ofadditional risk-adjustment variables (X) describing each patient.We specify these variables in the next section. The risk-adjustedmodel takes the form:~Cik ¼ fþXNn¼1bnSnik þXMm¼1gmXmi þ uk þ vik (3)The random effect in this equation captures the hospital’s in-fluence on costs over and above the influence of all the otherpatient-level variables accounted for in the model. Consequentlythe cost of a typical patient in a hospital with a relatively largerandom effect is higher than the cost of a comparable patienttreated in a hospital with a lower random effect.S. Daidone, A. Street / Social Science & Medicine 84 (2013) 110e118112In estimating models (1) and (3), it is important to recognisethat hospital cost data are highly skewedwith a long right-hand tail(Basu & Rathouz, 2005; Beeuwkes Buntin & Zaslavsky, 2004;Manning & Mullahy, 2001). Usual OLS methods may yield biasedand/or less precise estimates of means and marginal effects, sinceresults may not be robust to tail problems. Therefore in selectingour estimationmodel we compare OLSwith: i) OLS for log or squareroot transformed costs; ii) GLM; and iii) Finite Mixture Models(FMM).Data issues and descriptive statisticsWe analyse the hospital episode statistics (HES) for patientsdischarged from each English NHS acute hospital during thefinancial year 2008/9. HES comprise individual patient recordsdefined as a Finished Consultant Episode (episode) about everyNHS patient admitted to hospital in England. Episodes measure thetime patients spend under the care of a particular consultant. Welink the episodes for each patient in order to capture informationabout the full course of hospital treatment (Castelli, Laudicella, &Street, 2008). Our analytical sample consists of 12,154,599 pa-tients treated in 163 hospitals. The selection of the sample isdescribed in detail in the supporting material.We look at the information in each patient’s medical record toascertain whether or not specialised care was received, as definedby the Specialised Services National Definition Sets (SSNDS) (NHSSpecialised Services, 2010c). The third edition contains 34 defini-tion sets each of which identifies a set of diagnoses and proceduresthat are deemed either definitively or potentially specialised usingthe International Classification of Diseases (ICD), version 10, andthe OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures, version4.5. We construct a dummy variable for each definition set, taking avalue of 1 if any one of the definitive specialised codes appears inthe patient’s medical record. For seven definition sets, no definitivecodes are provided because additional criteria must be consideredin determining whether specialised care is required (for examplesee NHS Specialised Services (2010a)), so these definition sets areexcluded from the analysis. Thus, we construct 27 dummy variablesindicating which type of specialised care has been received.We addan additional condition that patients were treated at a hospitaldeemed by the Department of Health to have the necessary teamand infrastructure to provide specialised care and, therefore, to bedeemed eligible for specialised funding. We perform a sensitivityanalysis that relaxes this latter condition.In 2008/9, for approximately 1.5 m patients it was indicated thatsome kind of specialised service was delivered as part of thetreatment package. Table 1 reports the number of patients whoreceived each type of specialised services, showing, for instance,that more than 360,000 patients received specialised renal servicesas defined in the renal SSNDS (NHS Specialised Services, 2010b).Some 32,000 patients received more than one of the broad types ofspecialised service.Consider the distribution of specialised services among hospi-tals. Fig. 1 shows the proportion of each hospital’s patients thatreceived specialised services (the bar height) and the proportionsthat were eligible (dark) or not (white) for additional payment. Aswould be expected, most specialised care is provided by thosehospitals classified by the Department of Health as eligible pro-viders. Nonetheless, a non-trivial portion of specialised services isprovided by hospitals that are not deemed eligible for additionalfunding for these particular services.Patient characteristics are derived from information containedin their medical record. In Table 2 we report descriptive statistics ofthe explanatory variables used in the right-hand side of Equation(3). Patients receiving specialised services are more likely to bemale and younger (probably mainly because infants are more likelyto require specialised activity, 16% of them at birth), to have beencared for by more than one consultant during their hospital stay,and to have been transferred between hospitals. As the diagnosticcharacteristics were constructed using ICD10 codes, there might besome overlap with the codes used for the definition of specialisedservices. However, other than a very small correlation betweenobesity and morbid obesity services, we found no correlation be-tween the specialised services and other patient characteristics.ResultsDistribution of patient costsIn order to compare the large variety of models to analyse pa-tient costs, we undertake a quasi-experimental approach followingan approach developed by Deb and Burgess (Deb & Burgess, 2008).We randomly split observations into two groups; half are assignedto the estimation group and the remaining half to the predictiongroup. We extract random samples with replacement of sizeN ¼ {20,000 50,000 200,000 500,000 1,000,000} from the esti-mation group. Then we estimate Equation (3) and save parameterresults for eight models.

Daidone, A. Street / Social Science & Medicine 84 (2013) 110e118114In order to assess the quality of the predictions we use twostatistics that are common in this kind of analysis: a) the meanprediction error (MPE) and b) the mean absolute prediction error(MAPE), which measure predictive accuracy on average and forindividual observations. Results confirm that, compared to theother models, simple OLS has very good predictive performanceboth on average and for individuals (Table 3). Accuracy improves asthe sample increases, but notmonotonically. Log-linear OLSmodelsare the least precise, even allowing for Duan correction factors(Duan, Manning, Morris, & Newhouse, 1983). The FMM with twocomponents suffered convergence problems, particularly for thesample of 20,000 observations. Therefore in Table 3 the averageMPE and MAPE is given by the models that achieved convergence.In terms of performance, FMM is positioned behind linear OLS andGLM, but is more accurate than log-linear models. Given these re-sults, we decided to undertake the analysis on the full datawith justa linear OLS model and a GLM with a gamma distribution andsquare root link. Gamma distributions were chosen based on theresults of modified Park tests.Specialist mark-upsInTable 4wereport thepredictedpercentage increase in costs forspecialised services for the two equations using OLS and GLM. Thespecialised markers where estimates are statistically significant (p-value<0.01) appear in bold. There are some general issues to note.First, the significance of the specialist markers is consistentacross specifications. This means that we can be confident ininterpreting (i) a significant positive coefficient as indicating thatthe specialist marker has a significant positive impact on cost and(ii) a non-significant coefficient as indicating no significant impactof this type of specialised care on costs.Second, for the same specification (Equation (1) or (3)) the OLSand GLM estimates are very similar, differing by no more than 1.25percentage points for all but one specialist marker, infectious dis-ease, for which GLM estimates are 3 percentage points lower. Thegeneral consistency of results is unsurprising given the large sam-ple sizes.Third, for five types of specialised care, estimates of the addi-tional costs differ by more than one percentage point whencomparing Equation (1) and the risk-adjusted Equation (3). This isevident for specialised care for neurosciences, cystic fibrosis, chil-dren, rheumatology and vascular diseases (for which the signifi-cance level also falls from p< 0.01 to p< 0.05). This implies that theset of patient characteristics used as risk-adjustment variables arejointly correlated with the type of specialised care in question. Forthose hospitals that provide these types of care, it will be particu-larly important to account for these characteristics when makingjudgements about relative hospital performance based on therandom effects.The specialised services that drive higher costs relative to otherpatients allocated to the same HRG are cancer (18% higher costs),Table 3Average performance of competing models.Model Statistics Estimation sample20,000 50,000 200,000 500,000 1,000,0001 MPE 0.006659 L0.004329 0.003627 L0.002550 L0.002534MAPE 0.471862 0.469603 0.468406 0.467833 0.4677532 MPE 2.411588 1.626989 0.874667 0.877367 0.840543MAPE 2.870144 2.088513 1.337236 1.340781 1.3039923 MPE 2.708189 1.832423 0.989557 0.994005 0.952426MAPE 2.881833 2.006294 1.162441 1.167355 1.1257754 MPE 2.138670 2.063748 2.010085 1.902191 1.948482MAPE 2.243711 2.166274 2.108399 2.002521 2.0464315 MPE 0.008342 0.005645 0.004713 0.003663 0.003672MAPE 0.473157 0.470833 0.469535 0.469020 0.4689676 MPE 0.006665 0.004370 0.003781 0.002726 0.002728MAPE 0.471149 0.469311 0.468381 0.467870 0.4678107 MPE L0.065603 0.004975 L0.003580 0.003253 0.002179MAPE 0.532327 0.471940 0.470543 0.471467 0.4707188 MPE 0.400378 0.336326 0.334915 0.322274 0.325995MAPE 0.770003 0.707454 0.685659 0.679344 0.680713Notes: MPEemean prediction error; MAPEemean average prediction error.

The considerably higher addi-tional costs for specialised spinal services and cystic fibrosis ser-vices are partly a reflection that patients requiring these types ofcare often also receive other types of specialised care (almost aquarter of cystic fibrosis and a half of spinal patients).Table 5 reports the coefficients associated with the risk-adjustment variables for both the OLS and GLM versions of Equa-tion (3) (the specialist markers previously reported in Table 4 arenot reported). This table shows that, compared to other patients inthe same HRG and over and above the influence of specialised care,patients have higher costs (p < 0.01) if they are pregnant (preg-nancy), suffer allergy (allergy), congenital malformations (con-gmalf) or problems related to psychosocial circumstances(risk_psysoc), were transferred between hospitals (tr_*) or con-sultants (episodes) during their treatment, if they died in hospital,of if they were treated in London (despite the MMF correction forthe higher costs of labour, land and buildings). Patients diagnosedwith alcohol problems have slightly lower (4e5%) costs. The rela-tionship between cost and the deprivation of the patient’s area ofresidence (imd*) is sensitive to the deprivation indicator and to thechoice of OLS and GLM but generally appears insignificant. Age doesnot have a significant influence on costs, probably because this isalready accounted for in the construction of HRGs.Sensitivity analysesOur estimates are generally robust to alternative definitions ofspecialised care (table of results shown in the supporting material).In particular, in sensitivity analyses we relax the condition thatpatients have to be treated in eligible hospitals and we excludepatients from the analysis if they were allocated to HRGs in whicheither fewer than 10 patients did not receive specialised care orfewer than 10 patients did receive specialised care.In the first case, the estimated marginal effect in both equationsis unchanged, except for spinal and children’s services, for whichwe observe a reduction of ten percentage points. The differencearises because patients receiving specialised spinal and children’sservices are not concentrated exclusively among those hospitalsdeemed eligible by the Department of Health for additional pay-ments. The lower estimates for these types of specialised care implythat hospitals that specialise in providing these services and areeligible for additional funding are more expensive than those thatdo not specialise, all else equal.The results are not sensitive to excluding patients in particularHRGs, except for vascular diseases services, for which the marginalcost becomes 7 percentage points higher, and blood and marrowtransplantation services, where the marker becomes positive andsignificant. The sensitivity of results for these two specialised ser-vices is due to considerably fewer patients now being identified asreceiving specialised care for these services. Therefore, this impliesthat the HRGs for these services are already capturing the speci-alised nature of care for the majority of patients receiving vascularand blood and marrow transplantation services.Hospital performanceAs would be expected, the vast majority of the variance in pa-tient costs is due to whether they receive specialised care and totheir different characteristics rather than to the hospital in whichthey are treated. This is evidenced by r ¼ s2u=ðs2u þ s2εÞ ¼ 0:017 forthe OLS Equation (3).Nevertheless, there are differences among hospitals in the sizeof their random effects, implying variation in average costs acrossTable 5Complete model (Equation (3)), estimates of explanatory variables coefficients.OLS GLM OLS GLMimd04c 0.000 0.021 tr_out_nonel 0.129 0.129imd04ed 0.000 0.000 die 0.072 0.073imd04hd 0.009 0.022 emerg 0.013 0.023imd04hs 0.000 0.001 episodes 0.108 0.106imd04i 0.090 0.075 East of England 0.115 0.109imd04ia 0.047 0.104 London 0.160 0.140imd04ic L0.078 0.014 North-East 0.022 0.033imd04le 0.000 0.001 North-West 0.009 0.017imd04rk 0.000 0.000 South-East 0.068 0.081pregnancy 0.079 0.057 South-West 0.007 0.021drug 0.001 0.009 West Midlands 0.044 0.030alcohol L0.041 L0.051 Yorkshire 0.055 0.080smoke 0.008 0.005 urban1 0.003 0.005obesity 0.013 0.026 white1 0.015 0.008allergy 0.026 0.024 female1 0.599 0.431diabetes 0.008 0.018 male1 0.600 0.434hypertens 0.047 0.056 age 0.085 0.070haemorr 0.081 0.071 age2 0.002 0.002histdis 0.020 0.020 age3 0.000 0.000riskfact 0.001 0.012 femage 0.086 0.071congmalf 0.051 0.058 femage2 0.002 0.002risk_phys 0.007 0.004 femage3 0.000 0.000risk_psysoc 0.192 0.175 malage 0.087 0.071tr_in_el 0.008 0.012 malage2 0.002 0.002tr_in_nonel 0.160 0.157 malage3 0.000 0.000tr_out_el 0.140 0.122 _cons 0.260 L0.630Notes: Bold figures 1% significant, underlined figures 5% significant.

Hospitals can beranked according to their random effect, ordered from those withthe lowest average costs for their patients to those with the highestaverage costs. Ranking is not sensitive to linear OLS and GLM formsof the model, the correlation between the random effects for thetwo versions of Equation (3) amounting to r¼ 0.99. For a handful ofhospitals there are some movements but for most hospitals theranking is little changed, as can be seen in Fig. 2. Deviations fromthe 45 line are completely negligible at the bottom and at the topof the rankings and minor in the middle.We explored the relationship between each hospital’s randomeffect and the extent to which it provided specialised care,measured as the number of patients receiving specialised care as athe proportion of total activity. We found a moderate correlation ofaround 32e34% depending on the OLS or GLMmodel. We exploredthis further by performing regressions for specialised vs. non-specialised providers of children’s care. We defined a hospital asa “specialised” provider of children’s services either if more than 5%of its care provided to children was specialised or if it defines itselfas a specialised Children’s hospital. The estimated effect for chil-dren services is always lower for these “specialised” providers,probably because they can better exploit economies of scale.Conclusions and discussionWe have evaluated the possibility that hospitals providingspecialised care might be financially disadvantaged under a pro-spective payment regime because HRGs do not account fully for thecost implications of specialised services. Our analysis involvedcalculating the additional costs associated with receipt of speci-alised care for more than 12 million patients treated in 163 Englishhospitals during 2008/9. We compared various functional forms interms of their ability to predict the distribution of our cost data andfound that OLS and GLM were superior to logarithmic trans-formations and finite mixture models. The performance of OLSrelative to other models is due to a large sample size which pro-duces unbiased estimates and precise individual predictions. Un-surprisingly, individual predictions are better when a GLM withgamma distribution is used for smaller samples, as this distributionis better able to accommodate the skewed nature of the cost data.Of course, in any empirical analysis one can question the data,both in terms of its representativeness and accuracy. A majorstrength of our study is the large sample size, consisting of almostthe entire English patient population. Nevertheless some patientswere omitted because of missing data, the main reason being anabsence of costs which was non-random across hospitals. Thusresults may be biased in an indeterminate direction. It should berecognised, though, that this limitation applies not just to our studybut to the English reimbursement regime itself. The payments aresupposed to reflect the national average costs for all patients allo-cated to the same HRG (Street &Maynard, 2007), but if the cost dataare absent from our study, they are also absent from the calculationof the tariffs. Ultimately it is for hospitals themselves to improvetheir costing and reporting processes to ensure that they are notdisadvantaged by having their patients under-represented in ana-lyses conducted for purposes of payment design. Evaluation offuture years’ data may be more comprehensive.Our study relies on agreed definitions of what constitute spe-cialised care for particular types of patients. In England, there are 34sets of definitions (SSNDS) each of which has been “approved bythe National Specialised Commissioning Group and endorsed bythe relevant professional organisations” (NHS Specialised Services,2010c). For 27 of the SSNDS, definitions are based on diagnosis orprocedure codes which, if present in the patient’s medical record,are said to provide a definitive indication of the receipt of speci-alised care. Our analysis takes these definitions as given and in-vestigates the cost consequences of patients with these diagnosis orprocedure codes. Of course, onemight question the validity of thesedefinitions of specialised care, in particular the use of proceduralcodes given that the choice of procedure is partially a clinical de-cision that may vary among clinicians that treat otherwise similarpatients. This criticism, however, applies equally to the construc-tion of HRGs themselves, which are somewhat atypical amongDRG-type systems in being based on both procedure and diagnosiscodes (Kobel et al., 2011).Our analysis suggests that, for some types of specialised care,costs are indeed higher than for other patients allocated to thesame HRG. The implication for payment policy is that hospitals thattreat such patients might be paid an additional surcharge over andabove the payment associated with the HRG to which these pa-tients are allocated. The size of additional surcharge might be up tothe percentage increase in costs as reported for Equation (1) inTable 4. Implementation should be on a budget neutral basis,involving a reallocation from the base national HRG tariffs to pay forany surcharges to be made for specialist care.The specialised services meriting surcharges are cancer (18%higher payment than for other patients in the same HRG), spinal(28%), neurosciences (23%), cystic fibrosis (38%), children’s (20%),rheumatology (13%), colorectal (21%) and orthopaedic (21%). Sur-charges would not be made in the presence of the other specialisedcare markers, there being insufficient evidence to suggest that thecosts associated with these types of specialised care drive highercosts.While we recommend that the amount of payment reflects theestimated percentage increase in costs, different values could beadopted, justified on other grounds. These grounds may include:transitional arrangements, notably for children’s services, wherethe recommended value of 20% is substantially lower than the 78%surcharge that applied when our analysis was commissioned(Department of Health, 2011); materiality, where an additional top-up would have limited financial consequence for those types ofspecialised services that are delivered to only a small number ofpatients; and sensitivity to model specification, though thesegenerally prove immaterial.Our analysis also demonstrates that there is substantial varia-tion in the average cost of treatment across the hospital sector, andthat this variation is due neither to the provision of specialisedservices, and nor to the casemix, diagnostic or socio-demographiccharacteristics of each hospital’s patients.
