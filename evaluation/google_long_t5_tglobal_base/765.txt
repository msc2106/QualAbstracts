ABSTRACT: 
This paper explores how the ballad melody of the â€˜Rich Merchant Manâ€™ was fundamentally linked to a drive to educate the serving classes of seventeenth-century England in the appropriate expectations of the ever-growing merchant class, via a negative model of punitive retribution that stressed the need to be charitable and to shun greed for material wealth. In so doing, it offers a case-study of the multi-media methods by which this moral lesson of frugality and even charity â€“ so seemingly contradictory for a merchant class that defined itself by the accumulation of wealth â€“ could be inculcated in the youth it was attempting to train.

 Â² so seemingly contradictory for a merchant class that defined itself by the accumulation of wealth Â² could be inculcated in the youth it was attempting to train. The Â¶Rich Merchant ManÂ· tune comprises a four-line stanza known as a Â¶SRXOWHUÂ·V-PHDVXUHTXDWUDLQÂ·with iambic feet of 3, 3, 4 and 3 stresses, and rhyming second and fourth lines. This was an extremely popular measure for both balladry and poetry from the Elizabethan era onwards, and made the melody simple to sing and thus well-known. I have written elsewhere about the significance of certain melodies for the transmission of meaning in ballads.5 By re-using familiar tunes, a technique known as contrafactum, ballad-writers exploited the cultural and emotional associations that listener-singers brought to that melody and to its new Chicago Press, 2006), 133.

Researching the various ballad texts set to a particular tune is key to understanding the overlapping and intertextual meanings that they carried for their audience, and Â¶The Rich Merchant ManÂ· is a good example of the rich matrix of melody, moral lesson and class commentary that the multimedia early modern ballad could transmit. The melody itself has an interesting feature which has potential ramifications for WKHWH[WÂ·V meaning when performed. It is in the major key of BÍ–, so the tonic, or main chord, of the melody is BÍ– and the dominant, or second most common chord, is F. The melody keeps predictably to this pattern until the last long note of the second line of verse, where it somewhat unexpectedly drops to F(?, before immediately resolving back into F natural.6 This drop to F(? draws the OLVWHQHUÂ·VDWWHQWLRQPRUHVWURQJO\WRWKHILQDOZRUGRIWKHVHFRQGOLQHRIYHUVHwhich, given the abab rhyme scheme, rhymes with the last word of the stanza. This emphasizes the stress on the two words already created by the rhyme, and also offers performers the option of drawing out the note on particularly significant or emotive lyrics. Take, for example, a verse from WKHEDOODGÂ¶7KH8QIDLWKIXO6HUYDQWÂ·, about a servant who conspires to murder her mistress, recently delivered of a child: Strong poyson we contriv'd this was our hanious Sin, That she of Life might be depriv'd poor Soul when she lay in. 7 6 I would like to thank Matthew Ingleby for his assistance with the music theory. 7 ÂµTHE Unfaithful Servant; AND The Cruel Husband.

IRFXVHVWKHOLVWHQHUÂ·VDWWHQWLRQRQWKHZRUGÂ¶6LQÂ·DSRWHQWWHUPthat becomes even more emotive when it is juxtaposed with the rhyming Â¶OD\LQÂ·Thus, in this particular ballad the melody helps to increase the emotional impact of the shocking news of the murder of a woman who had only just given birth. It is perhaps this ability of the Â¶5LFK0HUFKDQW0DQÂ·melody to guide its listeners in the appropriate emotional response that results in its use in so many ballads that preach a message of repentance for the sin of greed. While early modern ballad tunes are often quite versatile, being used for ballads on a range of topics and in a range of moods, this particular tune was associated from its origins with a didactic message about the punishment of greed.8 The plot of the original Merchant Man song, Â¶A most sweet SongÂ·, presents its audience with the depiction of the model repentant sinner. After killing a man Â¶WKURXJKTXDUUHOV,Â·DULFKPerchant from Chichester is sentenced to be executed in Emden, Germany.

He even appears to be showing us his fine stockings as he steps down. The clothing worn in the woodcut, which matches with that described in the ballad, especially the cambric ruff, was out of fashion by the 1630s, the earliest printing dates that we have for any extant broadsides. However, we know the song was registered as early as 1594. While it is 7 and silk stockings, luxury items and fabrics that would have distinguished him as wealthy, and yet his choice of colours would have muted claims of ostentation or extravagance. ,QWKLVSHULRGDV8OLQND5XEODFNUHPLQGVXVÂ¶EODFNGHQRWHGFRQVWDQF\DQGVRPEUHQHVVZKLWHV\PEROLVHGIDLWKDQGKXPLOLW\Â·11 Our introduction to the merchant is therefore Â² despite his conviction for murder Â² overwhelmingly positive. This is notable because of the potentially problematic role of merchants in the developing seventeenth-century English economy. Between 1520 and 1700 the population of England doubled, producing inflation along with what has been called Â¶WKHVWHDG\SUHVVXUHRIDprolific population on LQHODVWLFUHVRXUFHVÂ·.12 The need for expanded trade, both internal and international, in order to feed and clothe the populace meant that merchants were in a position to both help and exploit their fellow citizens.

This portrayal is reinforced by the actions of the other merchants of the town, as told in the ballad: although they RIIHUÂ¶DWKRXVDQGSRXQGÂ·WRVHWKLPIUHHthe condemned merchant refuses these gifts to secure his liberty, accepting his execution as just.

Then, based on popular belief that were a virgin to offer herself in marriage to the condemned he would be pardoned, multiple women come forth to offer him their hand in marriage; he refuses all their offers, instead giving them a thousand pounds in gold to share equally. 14 Finally, at the very moment at which the executioner steps forward to decapitate the merchant, a damsel steps forward and offers up her life for him: Ile dye within thy arms, if thou wilt dye (quoth she) Yet live or dye sweet English-man, 14 In Germany, where the ballad is set, this belief was popular until the nineteenth century although it had no legal status; see Richard van DÃ¼lmen, Theatre of Horror: Crime and Punishment in Early Modern Germany, trans.

Although it is about an execution, Â¶A most sweet SongÂ· does not follow the structure of a traditional execution ballad. It does not detail the crimes of the condemned, nor portray him as a wicked sinner who has led a life of wickedness 15 7KLVFODLPWKDW*HUPDQODZZDVXQDEOHWRVHL]HWKHPHUFKDQWÂ¶VSURSHUW\VHHPVWREHLQFOXGHGDVDSORWdevice, allowing the merchant to demonstrate his generosity.

Teaching charity through song This concern for the poor is a theme that runs through many of the ballads VHWWRWKHÂ¶5LFK0HUFKDQW0DQÂ·WXQH.

The poor person is rebuffed by a wealthier citizen who can be a merchant, farmer or member of the nobility, but who is often a member of their own family, usually an in-law. This greedy person is inevitably punished in a supernatural manner while the poor 16 Sandra Clark, Women and Crime in the Street Literature of Early Modern England (Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), Ch. 3; V.

Such ballads can be seen to be nostalgic for an earlier, less commercial time: Joyce Appleby notes that the Tudor statutes regarding food production had envisioned the growing of corn, the milling of flour and the baking of bread as principally social activities rather than economic ones, social underpinnings that were shaken by the economic crises of the early 1620s which forced the government to buy grain abroad and allowed merchants to manipulate the market.18 We find elements of the dissatisfaction with mercantile greed in Â¶The Kentish MiracleÂ·, a ballad whose protagonist is a widow with seven children who sells her coat and gown at market but has her purse stolen before she is able to buy any food.19 Her brother-in-law, a FRUQPHUFKDQWUHIXVHVKHUHYHQÂ¶DSHFNRIFRUQÂ·DQGVFROds her for being foolish.

Again and again the ballads depict poverty leading desperate people to betray (or almost betray) their families, and depict generosity as the only antidote to evil. Even the ballads WRWKHÂ¶5LFK0HUFKDQW0DQÂ·WXQH that relate no narrative and are rather simply didactic and moralising continue this theme of generosity towards the poor. These songs are explicit in their warnings about the divine punishments that will ensue if their listener-singers mistreat the needy, with titles such as Â¶A Warning-piece for all Wicked LiversÂ·. This EDOODGÂ·VUHIUDLQ offers a generic moral lesson, advising repentance to all groups of society: 20 Alexandra Walsham, Providence in Early Modern England (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999); Brodie Waddell, God, Duty and Community in English Economic Life, 1660-1720 (Boydell Press, 2012), esp.

Although the Poor Law had been in place since 1601 and there were systems established for the social welfare of those most vulnerable in society, these ballads that incessantly preach the need for charity and bemoan the ill-treatment of the 15 poor are testament both to the popular belief that charity should begin at home, rather than with the state, and to the fear that it was all too often absent in the community.23 As the seventeenth century saw a gradual movement from open, indiscriminate philanthropy to a PRUHVHOHFWLYHFRQFHUQIRUWKHÂ¶UHVSHFWDEOHÂ·SRRUthe truly needy could be left behind.24 Ballads to the tune of the Â¶Rich Merchant ManÂ· are repeatedly eloquent in their support for the most vulnerable, and the popular melody thus became associated with the necessity WRVKDUHRQHÂ·VPDWHULDOZHDOWKZLWKWKRVHPRVWLQQHHGHVSHFLDOO\PHPEHUVRIRQHÂ·VIDPLO\ While Â¶A Warning-piece for Wicked LiversÂ· promises only a lack of charity and eventual death for those who ignore its warnings, evidence of the more spectacular supernatural punishment for the mistreatment of the poor can be found in the ballad also to the tune of Â¶The Rich Merchant ManÂ· about Dorothy :LQWHUERWWRPEHWWHUNQRZQWRKHUIULHQGVDQGHQHPLHVLQ6RXWKZDUNDVÂ¶'LUW\'ROOÂ·$OUHDG\Â¶QRWRULRXVÂ·IRUKHUPDQ\YLFHVVXFKDVGULQNLQJ, begging and cursing, Winterbottom was most despised for exploiting the poor by lending out PRQH\Â¶XSRQWKH7DOO\Â· (offering high interest loans, the records of debtors being kept on a Â¶tallyÂ·, or register).

But its identification of a notorious figure of London life also links the song about Dirty Doll and her punishment to the genre of execution ballad, even though her death was the result of divine retribution rather than a sanctioned state execution.

'The Unfaithful Servant; and The Cruel Husband', Magdalene College Pepys 2.151; EBBA ID: 20769 The ballad is in the voice of the condemned criminal herself, who sings WRÂ¶\RXQJPDLGHQVÂ·of her slide from virtue into vice, first giving into the lustful desires of her master and then conspiring with him to poison his wife. It closes with her expressions of dread at the thought of her punishment by burning, and a final warning to spectators at the execution to learn from her example and turn away from sin. Significantly, the long detailed title offers much more information than the song itself: tKHVLQJHUÂ·VQDPHDQGWKDWRIKHUPDVWHUWKHORFDWLRQRIWKHDVVL]HVcourt where she was prosecuted, and the exact date and location of the execution (see note 21). It is important that these details are reserved for the title, because although it is possible for us to read the broadside and thereby locate this event in 22 time and space, many members of its early modern audience would never have read the ballad, either because they had little literacy, or because they simply heard someone else singing it. Although establishing literacy rates in early modern England is problematic and the source of endless scholarly dispute, we can be confident that the group of people least likely to have been literate in seventeenth-century London was female servants.29 Were they to only hear the ballad being sung, rather than reading it and its informative title, they may never have learned anything more about the tale than that a maidservant conspired with her master to replace her mistress and was burned to death for it. The ballad in its purely aural reception therefore becomes a interwoven group of moral imperatives applicable to any young woman in service: avoid amorous relations with your master, respect your mistress, and above all, avoid the temptation to get ideas above your station that will lead you to ruin.30 Offering a contrasting depiction to the ballad version was a prose account of the event: A Just Account of the Horrid Contrivance of John Cupper, and Judith Brown his Servant, In Poysoning his Wife by William Smith, Rector of Bitterley, whose six-page detailed prose account provides more detailed information about the case than the ballad.31 There is much greater focus in the pamphlet on the husband, John 29 David Cressy, Literacy and the Social Order: Reading and Writing in Tudor and Stuart England (Cambridge: &DPEULGJH8QLYHUVLW\3UHVV(YH5DFKHO6DQGHUVDQG0DUJDUHW:)HUJXVRQÂµ/LWHUDFLHVLQ(DUO\0RGHUQ(QJODQGÂ¶Critical Survey 14, no. 1 (2002): 1-.HLWK7KRPDVÂµ7KH0HDQLQJRI/LWHUDF\LQ(DUO\0RGHUQ(QJODQGÂ¶LQThe Written Word: Literacy in Transition, ed.
