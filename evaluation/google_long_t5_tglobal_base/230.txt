ABSTRACT: 
Al-Azhar, traditionally Egypt’s most respected and influential center for Islamic study, adopted an increasingly bold platform opposing Egyptian government policy throughout the mid-1990s. Al-Azhar defied government policy on a variety of sensitive issues, including population control, the practice of clitoridectomy, and censorship rights. Moreover, al-Azhar directly challenged the government in high-profile forums such as the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in September of 1994. This open opposition was remarkable in light of the tremendous capacity that the Egyptian government has shown in the past to manipulate and control al-Azhar. Over the past century, and particularly since the 1952 Free Oficers’ coup, the Egyptian government virtually incorporated al-Azhar as an arm of the state through purges and control over Azhar finances, and by gaining the power to appoint al-Azhar’s key leadership. Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat, and Husni Mubarak all benefited from this dominance over al-Azhar by securing fatwas legitimating their policies. Given this overwhelming leverage, what can explain al-Azhar’s increased opposition to the government throughout the mid-1990s. 
 
PREDICTION: 
The government con-stantly tries to draw the largest possible political gain from al-Azhar.” 33 Statementssuch as these in the Egyptian press con rm Barry Rubin’s assessment that “linkswith the rulers, instances of corruption, and decrees seemingly at odds with tra-ditional Islamic practices eroded respect for al-Azhar.” 34 Although it is di cult to 10 Tamir Moustafa ascertain just how much legitimacy al-Azhar has lost among the mainstream ofEgyptian society, it is clear that government interference, manipulation, and outrightco-optation has considerably tarnished al-Azhar’s integrity in at least one sector ofEgyptian society.The government’s increasing control of religious institutions was also perhaps thesingle most important factor contributing to the resurgence of radical Islamic groups,including Jihad, Tak r wa al-Hijra, 35 and al-Jamaça al-Islamiyya, that were intenton overthrowing the Egyptian government through violent means. Shaykh al-Azhar Jad al-Haqq çAli Jad al-Haqq issued a fatwa stating that “if girls are not cir-cumcised as the Prophet [Muhammad] said, they will be subjected to situations thatwill lead them to immorality and corruption.” 60 Clitoridectomy continues to be ahighly contentious issue, with government agencies formally opposed to the prac-tice, most al-Azhar scholars and radical Islamists defending it, and the court actingas a forum to contest the tradition.Another important example of al-Azhar’s increasing criticism of governmentpolicy was its vocal opposition to the United Nations International Conference onPopulation and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994. Shaykh al-Ghazzali argued that it is the duty of the government to put to deaththose who are judged apostates of Islam; if the government does not ful ll this ob-ligation, then others have the right to carry out the sentence.64 The Azhar ScholarsFront placed similar pressure on the

Al-Azhar de˜ed government policy on a variety of sensi-tive issues, including population control, the practice of clitoridectomy, and censor-ship rights. Moreover, al-Azhar directly challenged the government in high-pro˜leforums such as the United Nations International Conference on Population and Devel-opment, held in Cairo in September of 1994. This open opposition was remarkablein light of the tremendous capacity that the Egyptian government has shown in thepast to manipulate and control al-Azhar. Over the past century, and particularly sincethe 1952 Free O¯cers’ coup, the Egyptian government virtually incorporated al-Azharas an arm of the state through purges and control over Azhar ˜nances, and by gainingthe power to appoint al-Azhar’s key leadership. Presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser,Anwar Sadat, and Husni Mubarak all bene˜ted from this dominance over al-Azharby securing fatwas legitimating their policies. Given this overwhelming leverage,what can explain al-Azhar’s increased opposition to the government throughout themid-1990s?This article argues that the increase in Islamist violence from 1992 through 1997gave al-Azhar more leverage over the government. Al-Azhar was willing to defendthe government from radical Islamist critics, which also threatened al-Azhar’s po-sition in Egyptian society, but it took advantage of this situation to press for Islamicpolicies of a more moderate cast. The government was forced to accept this bargainas it became increasingly dependent on al-Azhar for religious legitimation. More-over, the government found that manipulating al-Azhar and silencing its oppositionto state policy undermined al-Azhar’s in˘uence within Egyptian society and there-fore its ability to discredit opponents of the government. Finally, al-Azhar wonmajor concessions from the government by forming loose alliances with stateo¯cials sympathetic to al-Azhar’s interests.The ˜rst part of this article reviews the Egyptian government’s increasing controlof religious institutions and the impact that government control has had on the 4 ıTamir Moustafa standing of these institutions in Egyptian society. The next section explores howgovernment domination of religious institutions contributed to the rise of militantIslamist groups that challenged the legitimacy of the religious establishment. Andpart three examines how al-Azhar capitalized on government–Islamist tensions tochallenge the government and to gain major concessions. I end with an analysis ofgovernment–Azhar relations since the appointment of Muhammad Sayyid Tantawiand a theoretical conclusion on the paradox of state power and social control. INCREASING STATE CONTROL OVER EGYPT’S RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS Since its establishment in 973 A.D. , al-Azhar has had an uneasy relationship withEgypt’s rulers. 1 The university has stood for centuries as an intermediate institutionbetween the state and society, at times cooperating with Egypt’s rulers and at othertimes opposing them. As Egypt’s most important religious institution, al-Azhar facedintense pressure from the state to legitimize its rule, but the state did not have suf-˜cient resources to uniformly challenge its autonomy. Throughout the 19th and 20thcenturies, however, the Egyptian state increasingly interfered in the aˆairs of reli-gious institutions.Muhammad çAli (1805–48) was the ˜rst Egyptian ruler to challenge systemati-cally the power of Egypt’s religious institutions. As part of his program to build amodern Egyptian state and challenge the Ottoman government for control of the em-pire, Muhammad çAli reorganized land ownership and nationalized 600,000 feddans(623,000 acres) of waqf land 2 that had previously ˜nanced mosques and religiousschools and formed the economic foundation of the ulama. 3 This action impaired theautonomy of the ulama and made them more dependent on ˜nancing through statechannels. In addition, Muhammad çAli created an independent justice system to cir-cumvent the control of religious institutions. Another signi˜cant blow to al-Azharcame with Muhammad çAli’s founding of a secular school system for doctors, law-yers, engineers, and government bureaucrats. 4 These new secular institutions leftAzhar graduates with fewer opportunities and less in˘uence in the expanding govern-ment bureaucracy. 5 Successive governments gained further control of al-Azhar through reorganizationlaws in 1896, 1911, and 1930. These laws radically transformed al-Azhar’s decen-tralized structure and its role in Egyptian society. The reorganizations centralizedal-Azhar’s administration and gave the Shaykh al-Azhar 6 more authority over itsmany power centers. 7 These laws also increased the scope of al-Azhar’s authorityover religious education by granting it jurisdiction over the Teachers’ Training Col-lege and the School of Religious Law. 8 By centralizing authority within al-Azhar,the successive reorganizations facilitated al-Azhar’s manipulation by the state. At thesame time, however, centralization bene˜ted interests within al-Azhar, such as theless-established riw a q and the o¯ce of Shaykh al-Azhar. These common interestsbetween the state and in˘uential actors within al-Azhar explain why some Azharshaykhs were inclined to cooperate with the government despite increasing govern-ment regulation of religious institutions.The greatest government incursions into Egypt’s religious institutions in generaland al-Azhar in particular came after the 1952 Free O¯cers’ coup. Egypt’s new leader,LONG The State and Religious Institutions in Egyptı 5Gamal Abdel Nasser, understood the importance of gaining control over al-Azhar inorder to ensure domestic control and promote his foreign-policy objectives. WithinEgypt, Nasser wanted al-Azhar to lend legitimacy to his regime and its program oftransforming Egyptian society. Subordinating al-Azhar to the state also would allowNasser to balance the in˘uence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which threatened to mo-bilize Egyptians against the government. Moreover, Nasser understood that al-Azhar’sin˘uence extended well beyond the borders of Egypt and that government controlover the most respected and in˘uential institution of Islamic scholarship would be animportant tool in furthering Egypt’s leadership of Arab and Islamic nations.Just as Muhammad çAli had done more than a century earlier, Nasser ˜rst at-tempted to undermine the in˘uence of the ulama through the 1952 land-reform law.This law placed all waqf land, which had risen to 12 percent of all arable land sinceMuhammad çAli’s rule, under the control of the new Ministry of Endowments ( Wiz- a rat al-Awq a f ). 9 Through control of waqf lands, the government gained the author-ity to distribute waqf resources and the power to reward those who followed the leadof the government and punish those who did not. In 1955, Nasser also abolished allshariça courts, which had run parallel to the secular courts established by Muham-mad Ali in the 19th century. 10 Again, the Free O¯cers were continuing MuhammadçAli’s struggle to break the autonomy of Egypt’s religious institutions and shape theirresources to serve the interests of the state.Nasser’s most ambitious attempt to secure the state’s dominance over al-Azhar camein a 1961 law that radically reorganized the institution. 11 The reorganization ˜rstplaced al-Azhar under the formal jurisdiction of the Ministry of Endowments. AllAzhar ˜nances were to be directed through the appropriate state channels, givingnon-Azhar state o¯cials signi˜cant in˘uence over al-Azhar’s functions. Under the1961 law, the Egyptian president and the minister of endowments were also givenformal jurisdiction over important issues of appointment, most notably the appoint-ment of the Shaykh al-Azhar. Additionally, the Azhar High Council was reorganizedto include three government-appointed “experts in university education” and repre-sentatives from the ministries of Endowments, Education, Justice, and Treasury. 12 Finally, the 1961 reorganization expanded al-Azhar considerably from just three col-leges of theology, Arabic, and shariça to include many secular colleges, such as med-icine, law, and engineering. The forced expansion of al-Azhar into secular ˜elds ofstudy ensured that an increasing number of deans representing non-religious ˜eldswould be represented in the Azhar High Council. The impact of this reorganizationwas profound. Al-Azhar was transformed from an institution with a high degree ofindependence to one with very little autonomy from government interference.The 1961 law of reorganization was met with strong opposition from withinal-Azhar. During implementation of the reorganization law, Nasser was forced toappoint a series of temporary directors from the military. 13 While very little infor-mation is available about the circumstances of the opposition to government in-trusion, it is clear that these directors of Azhar aˆairs were charged with removingall resistance to government control. From 1959 to 1963, the number of faculty atal-Azhar dropped from 298 to 215. 14 It is assumed that the eighty-three Azhar scholarswho were removed were the most vocal in their opposition to government control. 15 Moreover, Law 818 of 1963 set up committees that were designed to purge al-Azharof all faculty who were unwilling to support the programs of Nasser’s regime. From 6 ıTamir Moustafa FIGURE 1. Total Azhar budget, 1935–66. The ˜gures for 1949–52 and 1964–65 are estimated. Budget˜gures were unavailable for these years. To my knowledge, budget ˜gures after 1966 are alsounavailable. However new projects and expanded programs suggest that al-Azhar’s budgetcontinued to be well funded after this period. Source : Crecelius, The çUlama and the State ,442. 1963 to 1968, these committees purged forty-˜ve more Islamic scholars, bringingthe number of faculty down to only 170. Chris Eccel observes that by 1975, the fac-ulty of al-Azhar was almost completely transformed. The vast majority of scholarswho received their education prior to the 1952 revolution were replaced by youngerfaculty members who had received their degrees in the 1960s and 1970s under Nasser.In addition to more overt forms of coercion, the government pushed through re-forms by exploiting ideological cleavages that had existed among Azhar scholars foryears. The government created alliances with progressive shaykhs who wanted toreform al-Azhar even if it meant giving up the institution’s autonomy. Among thosewho cooperated with the government was Muhammad al-Bahay, who was later re-cruited to the position of minister of endowments and director of al-Azhar aˆairs.Similarly, the government exploited personal rivalries and made alliances with oppor-tunists who sought high o¯ces within al-Azhar. 16 Although many Azhar scholars were bitter about increasing government regula-tions and al-Azhar’s reduced autonomy, the institution gained crucial state resourcesin the process. From 1952 to 1966 alone, al-Azhar’s budget increased more than fourtimes, from 1,537,000 Egyptian pounds to 7,000,000 Egyptian pounds. Financialsupport from the state allowed al-Azhar to double its student enrollment, increasesalaries for its scholars, oˆer more foreign scholarships, and increase its number offoreign missions throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East sevenfold. 17 In addi-tion, budget increases allowed al-Azhar to carry out massive capital projects, such asbuilding a new campus in Madinat Nasr and expanding its nationwide program ofprimary and secondary education (Figure 1). The State and Religious Institutions in Egyptı 7With the 1961 reorganization and the subsequent purges of al-Azhar faculty,Nasser gained the valuable endorsement of one of Islam’s most in˘uential institutionsof scholarship. Nasser used his new leverage over al-Azhar to secure fatwas that sup-ported the regime’s increasingly socialist policies, particularly to legitimize the gov-ernment’s commitment to land reform. While securing these fatwas from al-Azhar,Nasser also established the Supreme Council of Islamic Aˆairs, which addressed thesupposed connection between Islam and socialism. The Supreme Council’s publi-cation, Minbar al-Islam (The Pulpit of Islam), ran articles such as “Socialism andIslam” and “The Cause of the National Charter Is the Cause of Islam.” 18 Nasser also used fatwas to advance his foreign-policy objectives in the Arab andIslamic world. In the rivalry between Nasser and King Faisal of Saudi Arabiathroughout the 1960s, Nasser used al-Azhar’s fatwas to legitimize his policies andappeal to the sensibilities of Saudi Arabia’s citizens to rise up against their govern-ment. Nasser’s regime transmitted similar appeals throughout the Arab and Islamicworld on Egypt’s international radio program “Voice of the Arabs.” By 1963, “Voiceof the Arabs” was transmitted in twenty-four languages, totaling an estimated 755hours of transmission per week. 19 In a similar vein, Nasser ˜nanced students from allover the Muslim world to study at al-Azhar in order to increase the university’s con-nections with other religious establishments and build its international in˘uence.Anwar Sadat (1970–81) and Hosni Mubarak (1981–present) also took advantageof their leverage over al-Azhar to secure various fatwas supporting their own poli-cies. Sadat was able to secure fatwas that justi˜ed overturning Nasser’s land-reformprogram, his policy of In˜t a h (economic liberalization), and, most important, hispeace treaty with Israel in March 1979. 20 Mubarak has relied on similar fatwas fromal-Azhar to legitimize Egypt’s participation in the second Gulf War 21 and to con-demn Muslim extremists, particularly since the latest wave of violence that began in1992.In addition to gaining control of al-Azhar, the Egyptian government has been keento gain control over Egypt’s thousands of mosques. Traditionally, Egyptian mosqueshave remained outside state control, but with the nationalization of waqf lands, thegovernment has increasingly taken charge of their administration. This is consistentwith the government’s policy toward al-Azhar. Private mosques outside the govern-ment’s control could pose a serious challenge to the state. No other societal organi-zation is able to assemble such a large group on a weekly basis with an equal amountof in˘uence over the masses as does the mosque. 22 Beginning in 1952 and continu-ing until today, the governments of Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak have each partici-pated in an ambitious program of subsidizing and nationalizing virtually all of Egypt’smosques. 23 Table 1 illustrates the impressive scale of the nationalization project.This rapid increase in state ownership of mosques illustrates the government’s seri-ous commitment to the nationalization project. Although the government increasedthe share of state-owned mosques only marginally between 1962 and 1982, it waslargely successful in increasing the number of mosques that received state support.State support, at least in theory, increased the amount of leverage that the govern-ment could exert on private mosques. Under Mubarak’s leadership, however, the gov-ernment has raised the pace of mosque nationalization considerably and curtailedthe number of permits for new private mosques, increasing the share of state-owned 8 ıTamir Moustafa mosques to 71 percent of the total. The most intense eˆorts of nationalization, espe-cially in recent years, have targeted mosques located in the urban centers of Cairoand Upper Egypt, where the majority of extremist violence has been concentrated. 24 Although ˜gures are not readily available on the cost of this nationalization project,it is clear that the government has spent a staggering amount of money to bring thisnumber of mosques under its control. 25 Along with the nationalization of private mosques, the government has estab-lished speci˜c regulations for controlling who preaches in state-owned mosques andwhat kinds of topics are addressed. In the 1970s, Sadat’s administration establisheda network of district o¯ces in all of Egypt’s twenty-six governorates charged withselecting imams for state mosques and monitoring their actions. 26 In each district, acommittee composed of the local directors of the al-Azhar Institute and the Ministryof Endowments, and the director of education and social aˆairs, selects among can-didates aspiring to be an imam. Candidates are screened by the committee for anyradical religious or political sympathies. 27 Those who meet the approval of the com-mittee are provided with a license to preach and are assigned to a speci˜c mosque.Similar legislation has also passed through the People’s Assembly requiring preach-ers in all remaining private mosques to be approved and licensed through the Min-istry of Endowments.The High Council for Islamic Preaching, another district committee composed ofthe under-secretary of the Ministry of Endowments, the director of mosques, the di-rector of the fatwa in al-Azhar, and senior ulama, has the authority to decide the top-ics to be covered in state-controlled mosques. 28 The High Council drafts a quarterlyplan detailing acceptable topics for Friday sermons for distribution to all statemosques. Imams who stray too far from the outlined topics are punished. Muham-mad çAli Mahjub, Egypt’s former minister of endowments, outlined this policy in arecent interview. “When we receive reports and ascertain that a preacher is guilty ofviolations that harm social peace and security, then we consider that he has movedfrom preaching to political action. He must be removed.” 29 When Mahjub was askedwho monitors these mosques, he calmly replied, “A report covering any excesses inEgyptian mosques is compiled every week. Don’t worry; the mosques are under con-trol.” 30 Whether state monitoring is as e¯cient and eˆective as Mahjub claims isquestionable. What is clear, however, is the government’s objective of regulatingmosques throughout Egypt.

The State and Religious Institutions in Egyptı 9In sum, the Egyptian government has gone to extraordinary lengths to regulateand co-opt religious institutions to use them in the service of the state. It has virtuallyincorporated al-Azhar as an arm of the state, initiated an extensive program of nation-alizing private mosques, and instituted stringent controls upon who can preach atpublic and private mosques. The Egyptian government sought control of religiousinstitutions both to build its international in˘uence among other Islamic nations andto safeguard its domestic security. The central dynamic throughout this period wasone of institutional con˘ict, although at times Azhar shaykhs cooperated with the gov-ernment when it bene˜ted their particular riw a q , madhhab , or even narrower personalinterests. Al-Azhar resisted most government assaults on its institutional autonomy,but it was clearly the weaker institution of the two. Over time, the governmentachieved major concessions through purges of Azhar shaykhs, control of Azhar bud-gets, and the manipulation of long-standing ideological and personal rivalries.Despite the loss of its institutional autonomy, al-Azhar gained valuable ˜nancialresources that were not previously at its disposal. Access to government coˆers wasan important institutional achievement, allowing al-Azhar to expand its role inEgyptian society. However, increasing government control would also bring theweakening of al-Azhar’s most important resource over the years—its legitimacyamong the Egyptian public. AL-AZHAR’S CRIS IS OF LEGITIMACY AND THE RISE OF RADICAL ISLAM In the aftermath of the Azhar reorganization and its apparent manipulation by theEgyptian government, both institutions were subjected to increasing criticism from asigni˜cant spectrum of the Egyptian public. 31 Shaykh çAbd al-Hamid Kishk, a well-known Islamist preacher throughout Egypt and the Middle East, has been an outspo-ken critic of the government’s increasing encroachment on al-Azhar. Kishk, himselfa graduate of al-Azhar before the 1961 reorganization, argued that government ma-nipulation has soiled the integrity and position of al-Azhar. According to Kishk,“ever since the reform [of 1961], the leadership of al-Azhar has ceased to renderany service to Islam.” 32 Kishk, like many other Islamists, has condemned the gov-ernment for its manipulation of al-Azhar and called on the government to return theinstitution to its pre-1961 status. At the same time, Kishk has condemned al-Azharfor giving in to government pressure and acting as its pawn.Similar attitudes toward the domination of al-Azhar by the Egyptian govern-ment are found in the opposition press. Al-Shaçb , a daily newspaper with Islamistleanings, frequently prints articles condemning the government’s manipulation ofreligious institutions. An editorial by Ahmed çIzz al-Din that appeared in al-Shaçb illustrates the diminishing respect for al-Azhar, at least in one section of Egyptiansociety. In the editorial, the author argues that “since the ‘nationalization’ of al-Azharin the 1960s, governments have used the institution as a tool to deceive the publicand make it believe that Islam prospers in the country. . . . The government con-stantly tries to draw the largest possible political gain from al-Azhar.” 33 Statementssuch as these in the Egyptian press con˜rm Barry Rubin’s assessment that “linkswith the rulers, instances of corruption, and decrees seemingly at odds with tra-ditional Islamic practices eroded respect for al-Azhar.” 34 Although it is di¯cult to 10 ıTamir Moustafa ascertain just how much legitimacy al-Azhar has lost among the mainstream ofEgyptian society, it is clear that government interference, manipulation, and outrightco-optation has considerably tarnished al-Azhar’s integrity in at least one sector ofEgyptian society.The government’s increasing control of religious institutions was also perhaps thesingle most important factor contributing to the resurgence of radical Islamic groups,including Jihad, Tak˜r wa al-Hijra, 35 and al-Jamaça al-Islamiyya, that were intenton overthrowing the Egyptian government through violent means. Studies analyzingthe grievances and demands of Egypt’s militant Islamic groups suggest that one ofthe central reasons for the rise of religious militancy has been the increasing subor-dination of religion to the needs of the government. 36 Bianchi argues that “the verysuccess of corporatist policies has served to radicalize those who reject the right ofstate-appointed religious leaders to bend Islam to the needs of a secularizing re-gime.” 37 Ellis Goldberg’s comparative study 38 of radical Islam and the Protestantmovement further suggests that the rise of fundamentalism as a response to thestate’s strict regulation of religion is not peculiar to Egypt and that we can expect tosee the same phenomenon in similar contexts elsewhere. 39 Whereas Kishk and more moderate Islamists called on the government to returnal-Azhar to its pre-1961 status as a relatively autonomous institution, militant Islam-ist groups rejected the ulama and al-Azhar’s traditional role in Islam outright. Themost stunning and extreme symbol of militant opposition to both the government andal-Azhar itself was the abduction and slaying of Shaykh Muhammad al-Dhahabi, aformer minister of endowments and al-Azhar aˆairs, by the Tak˜r wa al-Hijra groupin June 1977. 40 The assassination shocked the ulama of al-Azhar, as al-Dhahabi wasnot only a government o¯cial but also a learned religious scholar. Moreover, ShukriMustafa, the leader of the Tak˜r wa-al-Hijra group, used his trial as an opportunityto declare that “Islam has been in decline ever since men have ceased to draw theirlessons directly from the Quråan and the sunna, and have instead followed the tradi-tion of other men, those who call themselves imams.” 41 Shukri Mustafa, like othermilitant Islamists, argued that the ulama had misguided Muslims with their own in-terpretations of Islam. According to Mustafa, the only texts that are required tounderstand Islam are the Quråan and a dictionary for understanding the meaning ofsome of its terms. Both al-Dhahabi’s assassination and this assertion were clearlyfundamental attacks on the traditional role that al-Azhar and the ulama had enjoyedin Egyptian society for more than a millennium. 42 At Anwar Sadat’s assassination four years later, an internal document of the Jihadgroup, entitled al-Faridah al-Ghaåiba (The Neglected Duty), was found, providinganother insight into the convictions of Egypt’s militant Islamist groups. Like ShukriMustafa’s statement, the document dismissed the legitimacy of both the governmentand al-Azhar in no uncertain terms. 43 According to Muhammad Faraj, author of al-Faridah al-Ghaåiba and the leader of Jihad, Egypt’s rulers must be overthrownbecause they are apostates and do not rule Egypt in accordance with Islamic law.Further, like Shukri Mustafa, Faraj argued that the ulama have misguided Muslims,and he questioned al-Azhar’s role as the sole interpreter of Islam. 44 This fundamental attack on al-Azhar’s role in Egyptian society did not go unan-swered. Shaykh al-Azhar Jad al-Haqq çAli Jad al-Haqq prepared a lengthy refutationof al-Faridah ’s position. 45 Jad al-Haqq argued that al-Azhar plays an important role LONG The State and Religious Institutions in Egyptı 11in Egyptian society, and that al-Faridah al-Ghaåiba ’s attack on al-Azhar is a “callfor illiteracy and primitivism in the name of Islam, which will encourage the youthto abandon their studies.” 46 Jad al-Haqq also cited verses from the Quråan support-ing the argument that the pursuit of knowledge is itself a form of jihad. 47 In an at-tempt to justify the ulama’s position in Egyptian society, Jad al-Haqq recalled thatthe Prophet once said, “the superiority of the knowledgeable man over the [simple]worshiper is like my superiority over the lowest of you.” 48 After quoting severalmore examples from the Quråan and hadith, Jad al-Haqq concluded that “if we ex-amine all the instructions from the Quråan and how it urges knowledge, the pursuitof education, and the preference of the ulama over others, we would have needed abook, nay books.” 49 In addition to defending al-Azhar’s role in Egyptian society,Jad al-Haqq found himself in the awkward position of defending the government’spolicies on theological grounds. Jad al-Haqq argued that Islam continues to thrivein Egypt and that, for the most part, the government has ful˜lled its duty of safe-guarding and promoting Islam. 50 Immediately after Sadat’s assassination, the Egyptian government likewise at-tempted to discredit militant Islamists in its own way. Mubarak promptly arrested4,000 suspected members of Egypt’s most radical groups and appealed to prominentshaykhs from al-Azhar to engage with them in a nationally televised “prison dia-logue.” The dialogue failed, however, when the Azhar representatives were either re-jected or mocked by prisoners who asked to be released, arguing that they had beenreformed by the guidance of the ulama. 51 The government appears eventually to haverealized that the Azhar representatives had lost much of their legitimacy, because thegovernment dismissed the Azhar shaykhs and called in the moderate Muslim Broth-erhood, 52 which had more integrity in the view of Islamic extremists and manyEgyptians in general.The lesson that the government has learned from this incident and the increasinglymilitant response to both al-Azhar and the government was that increased controlover al-Azhar is not necessarily in its long-term interests. Although the governmentwas able to secure fatwas from al-Azhar in support of its policies, the manipulationof religious institutions also contributed to the rise of militant Islam. In addition,government control undermined the respect that al-Azhar once commanded frommany Egyptians. Just when the government needed al-Azhar to in˘uence society anddiscredit militant Islamists, the institution was unable to do so. Paradoxically, increasedgovernment control of Egypt’s religious institutions did not help the governmentlegitimize its rule. Instead, it undermined the legitimacy of both the government andal-Azhar. FROM CONFLICT TO COOPERATION: MILITANT ISLAM AND THE AZHAR–GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE With the resurgence of militant Islam, the government and al-Azhar faced a com-mon threat that pushed the two institutions into an uneasy cooperative eˆort. Thegovernment found that its goal of combating militant Islamists and restoring do-mestic stability depended on a more independent al-Azhar that could provide a cred-ible theological response to its radical Islamist critics. Mubarak could depend onal-Azhar to provide a theological response to militant Islamists even without tight 12 ıTamir Moustafa government control because these groups challenged the authority and integrity ofal-Azhar as much as they threatened the government. Statements from the lateShaykh al-Azhar Jad al-Haqq çAli Jad al-Haqq exempli˜ed al-Azhar’s virulent con-demnation of militant Islamists and the recent violence in Egypt. According to Jadal-Haqq: Those who [commit violence] are not Islamists and do not represent Islam. They are criminalswho must be punished. Every individual who challenges public order and the state’s authorityand power must be punished. Such an individual is not an Islamist at all. Those who makemischief in the land are the enemies of God and his prophet. 53 If we consider al-Azhar’s institutional interests, it is quite understandable why theulama would cooperate with the government to discredit militant Islamists. It is safeto assume that throughout al-Azhar’s history, it has had three central interests:1. to maintain its institutional autonomy;2. to preserve its respected status in Egyptian society by maintaining its informalrole as the preeminent interpreter of Islamic texts and traditions; and3. to safeguard and encourage the propagation of Islam. 54 In supporting government eˆorts to discredit radical Islamists, al-Azhar advancedall three of these fundamental objectives. The ˜rst of al-Azhar’s central objectives,maintaining its institutional autonomy, was for years in direct con˘ict with the gov-ernment’s desire to control religious institutions. As we have seen, this producedprotracted con˘ict between the two institutions. However, with escalating violencethrough the early 1990s, the government became increasingly dependent on al-Azhar’sorthodox critiques of radical Islamist ideologues. 55 This gave al-Azhar more lever-age vis-  -vis the government than it had enjoyed in years. Al-Azhar’s indepen-dence was further promoted throughout this period because the government couldnot interfere in al-Azhar’s aˆairs without signi˜cantly undermining its eˆorts todiscredit the claims of militant Islamists. By 1992, al-Azhar was able to take posi-tions on social and political issues that clearly diverged from the government asa direct result of this new leverage.The second of al-Azhar’s central objectives, preserving its respected status inEgyptian society, was distinctly threatened by the rise of militant Islam. As we haveseen, militant Islamists dismissed the ulama’s traditional role as revered scholarsand indispensable interpreters of Islamic texts. To maintain its status, al-Azharmoved to discredit militants on theological grounds and bene˜ted from governmenteˆorts to physically suppress militant Islamic groups. Essentially, al-Azhar cooper-ated in a loose division of labor, with the government ensuring al-Azhar’s monopolyon religious leadership through physical coercion and al-Azhar discrediting militantIslamists on theological grounds. 56 Al-Azhar’s increasingly critical stands towardgovernment policies also served to preserve its respected status in Egyptian society.These stands acted as important signals to the Egyptian public that al-Azhar was nota pawn of the government, as radical Islamists claimed.The rise of a militant Islamic threat also indirectly facilitated al-Azhar’s eˆortsto advance its third central objective of propagating Islam in Egypt. As we haveseen, the Egyptian government was forced to grant al-Azhar increased autonomy so The State and Religious Institutions in Egyptı 13it could provide a credible theological response to militant Islamists. While the gov-ernment’s primary concern was the control of radical Islamic groups that threatenedEgypt’s stability, al-Azhar took advantage of its new-found space and leverage topursue broader interests that extended far beyond the role that the government pre-scribed. 57 Johannes Jansen has made the general observation that “although al-Azharand its graduates are essentially loyal to whatever government rules Egypt, al-Azharis a constant source of ‘calm pressure’ in the direction of further Islamization ofsociety.” 58 This observation invites us to take a closer look at how al-Azhar was ableto manipulate the di¯cult situation facing Mubarak’s government and press for amore pious state and society in contemporary Egypt. AL-AZHAR TAKES THE OFFENSIVE From 1992 to 1996, al-Azhar increasingly opposed government policy on a numberof sensitive issues. It also achieved some remarkable concessions. An important ex-ample of al-Azhar’s increased freedom to maneuver was its ˜rm opposition towardEgyptian government policy on clitoridectomy. 59 In September 1993, the CableNews Network (CNN) broadcast a report on clitoridectomy in Egypt in which a re-porter had ˜lmed a graphic scene of a ten-year-old girl screaming and kicking as hergenitals were cut as part of a tradition that is observed in Egypt and much of Africa.Although the international coverage prompted the Egyptian government to condemnthe practice of clitoridectomy, al-Azhar adamantly defended the practice. Shaykh al-Azhar Jad al-Haqq çAli Jad al-Haqq issued a fatwa stating that “if girls are not cir-cumcised as the Prophet [Muhammad] said, they will be subjected to situations thatwill lead them to immorality and corruption.” 60 Clitoridectomy continues to be ahighly contentious issue, with government agencies formally opposed to the prac-tice, most al-Azhar scholars and radical Islamists defending it, and the court actingas a forum to contest the tradition.Another important example of al-Azhar’s increasing criticism of governmentpolicy was its vocal opposition to the United Nations International Conference onPopulation and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994. The ICPD was a greatachievement for Mubarak’s administration. The week-long conference, which attractedstate o¯cials and development specialists from nearly every nation in the world, wasa prized opportunity for the Egyptian government to build its role as a leader in thedeveloping world. Unfortunately for Mubarak, al-Azhar issued strong statementsagainst the ICPD every step of the way. Al-Azhar’s main objections focused on theconference’s platform regarding sexual relationships and abortion rights.61 The IslamicResearch Council of al-Azhar condemned the sections of the draft resolution thatadvocated homosexual rights, defended premarital sex, and a¯rmed women’s right toabortion.62 While Mubarak’s government received attention for hosting the U.N. con-ference, much of the coverage in the international press focused on the con˘ictbetween al-Azhar and the Egyptian government. This was not the kind of press thatMubarak was hoping for.It could be argued that al-Azhar’s strong stand on clitoridectomy and its oppositionto the 1994 U.N. conference platform was not necessarily an indication of al-Azhar’snew-found leverage vis--vis the government. Perhaps al-Azhar chose to take these14ıTamir Moustafastands as a last resort against the increasing secularization of the Egyptian state andsociety, and issues of the family, sexual relations, and reproductive rights were areasin which al-Azhar was simply unwilling to follow the government’s lead.63 However,other issues demonstrate that al-Azhar has taken similar stands against other govern-ment policies and directives.One of the most startling stands that some al-Azhar ulama have taken against thewishes of the government has been to declare some of Egypt’s most respected intel-lectuals apostates of Islam. The most publicized of these fatwas was against theEgyptian writer Farag Foda, who was accused of blaspheming Islam after a heateddebate with al-Azhar shaykhs at the Cairo Book Fair. Just two weeks after the fatwawas issued by radicals within al-Azhar, Foda was gunned down by Muslim extrem-ists. Surprisingly, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazzali, himself a prominent member ofal-Azhar’s Islamic Research Council, testi˜ed at the trial of the two suspected assas-sins. Shaykh al-Ghazzali argued that it is the duty of the government to put to deaththose who are judged apostates of Islam; if the government does not ful˜ll this ob-ligation, then others have the right to carry out the sentence.64 The Azhar ScholarsFront placed similar pressure on the government to ban Yousef Chehine’s ˜lm TheEmigrant and the work of the Cairo University professor Nasr Abu-Zeid,65 who isaccused of blasphemy in his writings on the Quråan.Al-Azhar has also achieved signi˜cant gains by forming loose alliances with stateactors who share its vision of a more pious state and society. Just as the governmentwas able to exploit cleavages within al-Azhar by forming alliances with reform-minded shaykhs, al-Azhar has managed to exploit ideological splits within importantstate institutions. A recent ruling by Egypt’s Majlis al-Dawla66 is the most signi˜-cant example of Islamists in the state who have granted far-reaching concessions toal-Azhar. In July 1993, the Shaykh al-Azhar submitted a letter to the Majlis al-Dawlarequesting clari˜cation of which institution had jurisdiction over the censorship ofaudio and audiovisual productions dealing with Islam.67 Although al-Azhar had pre-viously acted as an adviser to the Ministry of Culture, it now sought to gain a monop-oly on censorship rights. By February 1994, the Majlis al-Dawla had arrived at adecision in favor of al-Azhar’s request for jurisdiction over censorship rights, de-claring: “the Honourable Azhar is the ˜nal arbiter in the assessment of the Islamicfactor, whose opinion is binding for the Ministry of Culture concerning the grant-ing or refusing of a license for audio and audiovisual productions.”68Egyptian intellectuals were stunned by the ruling because the Majlis al-Dawla hasa long history of supporting liberal values and promoting secular principles. More-over, the ruling was not in accordance with the general policy of Mubarak’s ad-ministration. Mubarak himself had demonstrated his commitment to protecting freespeech just one month prior to the State Council’s ruling by creating the HigherCouncil of Culture. The Higher Council, composed of twelve writers and journalists,was designed by Mubarak to give a voice to Egypt’s intellectuals who faced increas-ing threats and restrictions from Egypt’s growing Islamic movement.69In the wake of the Majlis al-Dawla ruling, attention focused on Tariq al-Bishri, thechairman of the General Assembly of the Board of Legislation within the StateCouncil.70 Al-Bishri, a respected judge and former leftist, became a moderate Islam-ist. Because it was not al-Bishri alone who had made the ruling, it became clear thatThe State and Religious Institutions in Egyptı 15Islamist sympathizers had a presence within the Majlis al-Dawla. This example lendscredence the view that the state should be considered not as separate from societybut, rather, as an institution embedded within society. The state can often adopt pol-icies that will enhance its “autonomy” from societal in˘uences, but this strategy cannever achieve complete success. Bureaucrats and even top decision-makers such asal-Bishri are, after all, members of the societies they govern.The most astonishing aspect of the Majlis al-Dawla ruling was that for the ˜rsttime al-Azhar’s decisions were to be binding upon the Ministry of Culture. At a work-shop sponsored by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, çAsim al-Disuqi, anEgyptian university lecturer, expressed the dismay of many intellectuals and seculargovernment o¯cials, saying: “This fatwa marks a new phase in the relationship be-tween al-Azhar and the state. The state has been using al-Azhar since 1895. . . . Thefatwa, however, changes the course of this relationship; it is al-Azhar that is nowusing the state through its own State Council.”71The government’s reluctance to disregard this ruling and to punish al-Azhar forits increasingly vocal opposition to a wide variety of state policies was due to theuncomfortable situation that the government faced. Although the state had provedits capacity to manipulate al-Azhar in the past, it became increasingly dependenton al-Azhar to discredit radical Islamists on theological grounds. Further, tight gov-ernment control of al-Azhar lends support to the extremists’ contention that thesecular state is corrupting and manipulating Islam for its own gain. Naguib Fakhry,chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, is one of the few who hasarticulated the changing government policy toward al-Azhar:The government is trying to outdo the fundamentalists by making itself look more religious,and this is where the Azhar, as an ecclesiastical body imposing its rule, comes in. Men of re-ligion are increasingly gaining ground every day since the government believes that this isthe only way to ˜ght fundamentalism, despite the fact that these men of religion may prove tobe even more of a threat than the fundamentalists. It is this attempt by the government to playthe piety card that has brought the Azhar to the foreground and given it more powers.72Given these gains, it is open to question whether the government or al-Azhar hasgained more from the two institutions’ relationship over the years. With its forcedreforms, the government clearly achieved the power to manipulate al-Azhar if it sochooses. The government has gained total ˜nancial control and the power to appointal-Azhar’s key leaders. The pressing question is whether manipulating these levers,as it has done in the past, is in the long-term interests of the government. The rise ofmilitant Islam in the 1970s and again since 1992, coupled with al-Azhar’s inabilityto provide a credible theological response, suggests that the government can controlal-Azhar only at a considerable cost.On the other side of the equation, al-Azhar has clearly bene˜ted from access tostate resources. With ˜nancial support from the state, al-Azhar has been able to in-crease its student enrollment and salaries for its scholars, expand its primary andsecondary branches throughout the country, and increase its number of foreign mis-sions. Al-Azhar’s reputation was adversely aˆected by its close association with thegovernment, but at the same time, the rise of militant Islam allowed al-Azhar todistance itself from the government while retaining its privilege to state ˜nancial16ıTamir Moustafaresources. The threat of militant Islam to Egypt’s stability also gave al-Azhar suf-˜cient leverage to challenge the government and even capture important functionsof the Ministry of Culture.THE LATEST PHASE IN RELATIONS BETWEEN AL-AZHAR AND THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENTIn March 1996, Mubarak was forced to make a momentous decision that wouldaˆect relations between al-Azhar and the government for years to come. Shaykhal-Azhar Jad al-Haqq çAli Jad al-Haqq passed away after heading al-Azhar for morethan fourteen years. Under the 1961 law of reorganization, Mubarak was left withthe responsibility of appointing a new Shaykh al-Azhar to replace the conservativeJad al-Haqq. After only twelve days of deliberation, Mubarak appointed the pro-government Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi.73Tantawi, the former Grand Mufti of Egypt, diˆered from Jad al-Haqq on a numberof issues. On clitoridectomy, he argued that the practice is merely a harmful customthat is not in accordance with Islam. Similarly, Tantawi defended the InternationalConference on Population and Development, which Jad al-Haqq had condemned,arguing that abortion is acceptable in Islam under certain circumstances.74 Further,he agreed with government policy on a number of other controversial issues, such asthe ability of banks to charge interest under Islamic law and the acceptability ofcasinos and alcohol within the Egyptian tourist industry. Although Tantawi ispraised by many Egyptian intellectuals and human-rights groups for his progres-sive stand on many issues, he is perceived by radical Islamists as the government’sreligious mouthpiece.Mubarak’s appointment of Muhammad Tantawi as the new Shaykh al-Azhar hasalready led to increased con˘ict on a number of levels. First, his appointment hascreated discord within al-Azhar. Although Tantawi has support from progressiveulama, conservative scholars have been highly critical of the appointment, whichthey view as an attempt by the government to reassert its dominance over al-Azhar.Within a year of the appointment, Tantawi took disciplinary action against conser-vatives who had challenged his appointment and leadership. Shaykh Muhammad al-Biri, president of the Azhar Scholar’s Front, and Shaykh Yahya Ismçail Halbush,general secretary of the front, were forced to resign from their posts in April 1998after they voiced intense criticism of Tantawi’s meeting with Israel’s chief Ash-kenazi rabbi. By June of the same year, Tantawi had completely dismantled theboard of directors of the Azhar Scholar’s Front after coming under ˜re for reformingal-Azhar’s secondary-education program. Shaykh Fawzi al-Zifzaf, a loyal supporterof Tantawi, was appointed to head the Azhar Scholars’ Front, and he promptlymoved to de-politicize the front by transforming it into a charitable association.Tantawi’s appointment has also increased tensions between radical Islamists andthe government. If we are to understand radical Islamists as more than just the prod-uct of economic hardship, demographic pressure, and failure in government policy,as Raymond Baker has suggested we do, then we should take seriously their cen-tral grievance that the government is manipulating and corrupting religion for itsown bene˜t.75 The appointment of Tantawi and the ongoing struggle within al-Azhar’sThe State and Religious Institutions in Egyptı 17ranks only adds to the existing disillusionment of radical Islamists. Moreover, theappointment undermines al-Azhar’s ability to de-legitimize radical Islam and lendslegitimacy to extremist claims that the government corrupts and manipulates religionfor its own gain.The appointment of Tantawi may be viewed by some scholars as a sign of thestrength of the Egyptian state. Mubarak’s ability to appoint a progressive, pro-gov-ernment scholar to head the most in˘uential institution of Islamic study is indeeda testament to the degree of control that the Egyptian state has gained over al-Azharin the past century. However, as the experience of the past several decades illus-trates, this policy will ultimately be self-defeating despite any short-term bene˜ts thatthe government may gain. Tantawi’s appointment should be seen not as a sign of statestrength but, rather, as a sign of the government’s increasing desperation. Mubarak iswell aware of the long-term impact that Tantawi’s appointment will have on state–society relations in Egypt. However, at the same time, he has seen the state’s controlof society erode on a number of fronts, primarily due to rapid economic liberaliza-tion.76 The appointment of Tantawi indicates that the Egyptian government is des-perately seeking ways to shore up its control over society and that it is willing toadopt short-term policies that may eventually undermine its rule.CONCLUSIONSThe case of religious regulation in contemporary Egypt suggests that governmentleaders can either attempt to dominate intermediate institutions or seek a cooperativerelationship. In consolidating their control following the 1952 coup, Egypt’s leadersopted for the prior strategy of domination and engaged religious institutions in astruggle for control. Although the government was able to dominate al-Azhar, sucha policy was not in the long-term interests of the state because it led to the growthof radical Islam and the relative decline in the legitimacy of al-Azhar, at least withinone segment of Egyptian society. The shift from domination to a cooperative rela-tionship in the early 1990s allowed the government and al-Azhar to confront thechallenge of militant Islam and bene˜t from what Migdal, Kholi, and Shue term“mutual empowerment.”77 However, the shift to a cooperative relationship was pain-ful and frustrating for the government because al-Azhar’s renewed in˘uence meantthat the government was forced to bear increasing criticism from an institution thatit once dominated. As this criticism increased and al-Azhar scored further victoriesover state institutions, the government found it more and more di¯cult to resist a re-newed policy of domination. The result was the appointment of the pro-governmentTantawi as Shaykh al-Azhar in early 1996.Gehad Auda has noted a similar pattern of interaction between the governmentand the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1980s.78 As the government attempted to dis-credit militant Islamists, it forged a cooperative arrangement with the moderate Mus-lim Brotherhood that is strikingly similar to the government’s subsequent partnershipwith al-Azhar. During this period, the Brotherhood renounced violence and pledgedto work within the political system for moderate Islamic reform. In return, the stateallowed the Brotherhood to run in the 1984 and 1987 parliamentary elections incoalition with secular opposition parties and to participate in the elections for a great18ıTamir Moustafanumber of Egyptian syndicates and associations. Auda argues that “this accommo-dation found its driving force in the state’s need to create a popular base against radicalfundamentalists.”79 However, Auda contends that the government soon fell victim toits own partnership as the Muslim Brotherhood took advantage of its political lever-age increasingly to criticize and pressure the government from within. Ultimately,the government broke its arrangement with the Brotherhood and again attempted todominate the organization. Not surprisingly, this change of strategy corresponded tothe resurgence of Islamist violence in the early 1990s and the government’s renewedcourting of al-Azhar.Over time, Egyptian government policy toward religious institutions appears to beschizophrenic: its policy toward both al-Azhar and the Muslim Brotherhood has shiftedback and forth between strategies of domination and cooperation. These pendulum-like shifts in policy are the result of a paradoxical relationship between state powerand social control. The primary goal of many developing states is to maintain socialcontrol and pre-empt challenges to the state. Ful˜llment of this goal pushes the gov-ernment toward a policy of domination. When the government has the capacity tocontrol intermediate institutions (particularly those which pose potential threats tothe state), it is likely to exert this control. Paradoxically, state domination has a per-verse eˆect on these institutions and the state’s standing in society. These dynamicsforce the government to reverse direction and enter into cooperative relationshipswith social forces that share some of its goals. However, as the case of al-Azharillustrates, cooperative relationships are often fraught with tension because interme-diate institutions begin to press for the government to further their own agenda. Asthis pressure builds, the government is tempted to sever its cooperative relationshipand renew a strategy of domination.This analysis casts considerable doubt on state-centered approaches to politics thatare prone to the simplistic assumption that a preponderance of state power over so-ciety will inevitably give it the ability to shape society as it wants. The Egyptian caseof religious regulation suggests that high levels of state power can paradoxically un-dermine the state’s control of society. The endemic problem of political instability inthe developing world in many cases is not the result of weak political institutions, asmany would suggest. Rather, many developing states are simply too strong vis--visintermediate institutions, tempting the strong state to adopt short-term horizons andpolicies of domination that eventually invigorate opposition and undermine the state’shold on society.NOTESAuthor’s note: An earlier version of this article was presented at the 1997 conference of the AmericanPolitical Science Association, Washington, D.C.

The Shaykh al-Azhar was charged withmanaging the institution as a whole (including maintenance, appointing various shaykhs to lead prayer, andacting as a ˜ gurehead). However, key roles were delegated to other Azhar o¯cials. For example, the leadingshaykh of each riwaq (residential unit) was responsible for guiding and disciplining the students under hisdirection, and the head of each mathhab (code of jurisprudence) was responsible for classes related to hislegal system.

While there were severalmovements that opposed the Shah’s rule, the ulama proved to be the most organized and eˆective forcein mobilizing public opposition. The Iranian Revolution illustrated the continuing in˘uence of the ulamain Iranian society despite decades of secular rule. Clearly, the Iranian Revolution ˜gures prominently inEgyptian government policy toward mosques.23The government has pressed a similar policy of subsidizing and nationalizing Coptic churchesthroughout Egypt.20ıTamir Moustafa24Bianchi, Unruly Corporatism, 191–92.25As with the government reorganization of al-Azhar in 1961, there has been resistance to the nation-alization of private mosques. In several cases, forced government nationalization has led to mass arrestsand rioting.

According to Goldberg, “both movements transferred religious authority away from o¯ciallysanctioned individuals who interpret texts to ordinary citizens.” There also seems to be a strong relation-ship between radical Islamist rejection of the ulama and the rapid increase in literacy in post-1952 Egypt.When the vast majority of Egyptians were illiterate, the ulama had unique access to the Quråan and otherIslamic texts. However, as the literacy rate increased and followers gained access to these same holy texts,it became possible for militants to challenge the respected status of the ulama in Egyptian society. Simi-larly, Protestant eˆorts to transfer religious authority away from established religious institutions dependedon increasing rates of literacy in Europe.43Muhammad çAbd al-Salam Faraj, al-Faridah al-Ghaåibah, reprinted in “Kutayyib al-farida al-ghaåibawa al-radd çalayhi” (The Neglected Duty Pamphlet and the Response to It), al-Fatawa al-Islamiyyah,vol. 10 (Cairo: Dar al-Iftaå al Misriyyah, 1982).

For agood theoretical framework of church–state relations, see Anthony Gill, Rendering unto Caesar: ThePolitical Economy of Church–State Relations in Latin America (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,1997).55Since early 1992, Egypt’s political climate has been marked by increasing violence between the stateand militant Islamic groups, leaving thousands dead. Assassination attempts against the president and theminister of interior underline the scale of the threat to the government.56Anthony Gill’s work on the political economy of church–state relations in Latin America provides aninteresting comparison with the Egyptian case. Gill’s work suggests that the Roman Catholic churchsought a cooperative relationship with the state in several Latin American countries when it faced increas-ing competition from Protestantism. However, unlike the Egyptian case, Latin American governmentswere reluctant to cooperate with the Catholic church because the state’s vital interests simply were notthreatened. As a result, church–state relations were marked by increasing con˘ict. Based on his researchin Latin America, Gill has also generated a theoretical framework that explains the conditions underwhich state and religious institutions will cooperate and when they are likely to come in con˘ict. As partof his framework, Gill argues that “if government o¯cials consider the religious or ideological challengeas threatening, they will be willing to cooperate with the church and church–state relations will remainfriendly.” This has been precisely the case in contemporary Egypt.57It should be noted that al-Azhar’s goal of propagating Islam is not inconsistent with the goals ofradical Islamists. This has led some to conclude that al-Azhar and radical Islamists cooperate in a loosedivision of labor. See Chris Eccel, “çAlim and Mujahid in Egypt: Orthodoxy Versus Subculture, or Divi-sion of Labor,” Muslim World 85 (July 1988): 189–208. Al-Azhar’s ulama do indeed share some goals withtheir radical Islamist counterparts, but, as we have seen, radical Islamist groups also threaten al-Azhar’sposition in Egyptian society, forcing al-Azhar and the state to cooperate. These overlapping interests areoften overlooked in the literature on Egyptian fundamentalism.58Jansen, The Neglected Duty, xix.59This practice is also referred to as female genital mutilation.60Cherif Cordahi, “Egypt: State Sits Uncomfortably Next to Islamic Clerics,” Inter Press Service, 29April 1995.61Under Jad al-Haqq’s leadership, al-Azhar also opposed the government’s program on population con-trol in general.62For statements of al-Azhar’s position toward the International Conference on Population and Devel-opment, see al-Wafd, 17 August 1994, 8, and al-Ahram, 11 August 1994, 7.63Indeed, an interesting parallel can be drawn between al-Azhar’s refusal to compromise on these fun-damental issues and similar circumstances with the Catholic church. In fact, the Catholic church issuedmany of the same statements as al-Azhar leading up to the 1994 International Conference on Populationand Development.64This is perhaps the clearest example of a “division of labor” that may exist between radical Islamistsand al-Azhar shaykhs. By condemning Foda as an apostate, al-Azhar essentially issued a death sentenceto be carried out by radical Islamists. Shaykh al-Ghazzali’s defense of the assassination further highlightsthe mutual interest of radical Islamists and some of the more radical Azhar shaykhs.65See “The Case of Abu Zaid,” Index on Censorship 4 (1996): 30–39.22ıTamir Moustafa66The Majlis al-Dawla (State Council) is an administrative court within Egypt’s judicial system.

Tantawi further argues that a woman shouldhave the right to abortion at any stage during pregnancy if the life of the mother is threatened. Further,Tantawi supports the government’s population-control policy in general.75Raymond Baker, “Afraid for Islam: Egypt’s Muslim Centrists Between Pharaohs and Fundamental-ists,” Daedalus (Summer 1991): 41–68.76For more on this, see Rex Brynen, Bahgar Korany, and Paul Noble, ed., Political Liberalization andDemocratization in the Arab World, Theoretical Perspectives (London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1995);Ibrahim Oweiss, ed., The Political Economy of Contemporary Egypt (Washington, D.C.: Center for Con-temporary Arab Studies, Georgetown University, 1990); Dennis Sullivan and Iliya Harik, ed., Privatiza-tion and Liberalization in the Middle East (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1992).77Joel S.
