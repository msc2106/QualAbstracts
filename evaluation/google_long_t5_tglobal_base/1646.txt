ABSTRACT: 
© 2018 Acoustical Society of America. This paper utilizes a rigid spherical microphone array to reduce wind noise. In the experiments conducted, a loudspeaker is used to reproduce the desired sound signal and an axial fan is employed to generate wind noise in an anechoic chamber. The sound signal and wind noise are measured separately with the spherical microphone array and analyzed in the spherical harmonic domain. The wind noise is found to be irregularly distributed in the spherical harmonic domain, distinct from the sound signal which is concentrated in the first few spherical harmonic modes. This difference is utilized to reduce wind noise without degrading the desired sound pressure level (SPL) by use of a low pass filter method in the spherical harmonic domain. Experimental results with both single-tonal and multi-tonal sound signals demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce wind noise by more than 10 dB in the frequency range below 500 Hz. The SPL of the desired sound signal can be extracted from wind noise with an error within 1.0 dB, even when the sound level is 8 dB lower than wind noise.

INTRODUCTIONAcoustic measurements in outdoor environments andventilation ducts are often contaminated by wind noise dueto the turbulent pressure fluctuations (Raspet et al., 2006;Shepherd and La Fontaine, 1986). Various methods havebeen explored in the past to attenuate wind noise, which canbe categorized into methods that utilize physical structuresand signal processing methods (Shust, 1998).Porous microphone windscreens are the most popularstructures for wind noise reduction (WNR), especially inoutdoor acoustic measurements (van den Berg, 2006).Strasberg (1988) analyzed the wind noise inside sphericaland cylindrical porous windscreens with dimensional analy-sis and found that the wind noise spectra measured by differ-ent researchers form a single curve when plotted against theStrouhal number. Morgan and Raspet (1992) compared thenoise reduction characteristics of various spherical open-cellfoam windscreens and showed that the spherical windscreenshave better performance than the streamlined windscreens.Zhao et al. (2017b) measured the WNR of five 90 mm diam-eter porous microphone windscreens with porosity from 20to 60 pores per inch (PPI) and showed that the 40 PPI wind-screen exhibited the best performance.Nonporous windscreens are also used to reduce windnoise, especially in the infrasonic range. Collier et al. (2014)investigated the WNR performance of three semi-porousfabric domes composed of different materials and showedthat the primary source of low frequency wind noise was dueto the pressure fluctuations on the surface of the domes.Shams et al. (2005) developed compact nonporous micro-phone windscreens for infrasonic acoustic measurementsbased on the assumption that the infrasound can penetrateany barrier of practical thickness while the wind fluctuationsare blocked by the solid nonporous walls. The experimentalresults showed that a windscreen composed of closed-cellpolyurethane foam with an internal diameter and height of3 9 in.2, and a wall thickness of 0.5 in. achieved the bestperformance. Dauchez et al. (2016) studied the performanceof a windscreen constructed from a squared plate coupledwith a nonporous cavity and showed the mechanism ofWNR to be the spatial averaging of the pressure fluctuationsover the plate.Hedlin and Raspet (2003) measured the WNR of acylindrical barrier of 2 m height with a diameter of 5.5 m,and compared to that of the rosette filters with diameters of18 and 70 m in atmosphere. It was found that the rosette fil-ters only produce reductions if the turbulence scale is smallerthan the diameter of the rosette, and the cylindrical barrierhas large reductions only when the scale size of the turbu-lence is smaller than the height of the barrier. Abbott et al.(2015) optimized the WNR of a porous wind fence enclosurewhich is 2.9 m high and has a diameter of 5.0 m, and foundthat the best reduction was achieved with a surface poro-sity between 40% and 55%, supplemented by a secondarywindscreen.In addition to the above methods adopting physicalstructures to reduce wind noise, signal processing techniqueshave also been widely studied.

(2007) measured the outdoor wind noise with a7 7 planar horizontal microphone array and found that thewind noise is substantially correlated for microphone separa-tions smaller than the size of the turbulent eddies. Wilsonand White (2010) analyzed the spatial and temporal charac-teristics of the wind noise, and discriminated the soundsignal from wind noise with a Gaussian-mixture-modelclassifier.In an alternative approach, McGuinn et al. (1997) pro-posed reducing the flow induced noise in ducts by use of theadaptive least mean square (LMS) algorithm to filter out theflow velocity fluctuations measured by a hot wire anemome-ter before subtraction from the pressure fluctuations mea-sured by a microphone. This was based on the assumptionthat the flow velocity fluctuations are highly correlated withthe flow induced noise. Similarly, Shust and Rogers (1998)studied the performance of wind noise removal from outdoormicrophones using velocity measurements from a four chan-nel anemometer and a simple model to transform the windvelocity fluctuations into wind noise estimates based on theBernoulli equation. Unfortunately, the Bernoulli equation isonly valid for fluid flows without turbulence and the coher-ence between the hot wire anemometer signal and the micro-phone signal is lower in outdoor environments, thus theperformance was unsatisfactory (Shust, 1998).In contrast to the abovementioned research, this paperutilizes a rigid spherical microphone array to mitigate windnoise. The sound signal and wind noise are first measuredwith the spherical microphone array separately and analyzedin the spherical harmonic domain. Then, a low pass filtermethod in the spherical harmonic domain is used to reducethe wind noise but retain the desired sound signal.Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the pro-posed method in situations where the wind noise spectrummasks the sound signal.II. METHODA low pass filter method in the spherical harmonicdomain (illustrated in Fig. 1) is proposed to reduce windnoise captured by a spherical microphone array. Therecorded signals are first transformed to the spherical har-monic domain via the discrete spherical Fourier transform(Rafaely, 2015),pnm ¼ Y†p; (1)where the superscript † denotes the pseudo inverse operation,p¼ [p(f, h1, /1),…, p(f, hq, /q),…, p(f, hQ, /Q)]T, p(f, hq,/q) is the signal at the qth microphone at frequency f, (hq,/q) denotes the elevation angle (hq) and azimuth angle (/q)of the qth microphone, and Q¼ 64 is the number of micro-phones in the spherical microphone array. pnm¼ [p00(f),p1(1) (f), p10(f), p11(f),…, pNN(f)]T are the spherical har-monic coefficients, N is the highest order of the decomposi-tion, and the matrix Y of dimensions Q(Nþ1)2 is given byY ¼Y00ðh1;/1Þ    Ymn ðh1;/1Þ    YNN ðh1;/1Þ... . .. ... . .. ...Y00ðhq;/qÞ    Ymn ðhq;/qÞ    YNN ðhq;/qÞ... . .. ... . .. ...Y00ðhQ;/QÞ    Ymn ðhQ;/QÞ    YNN ðhQ;/QÞ266666664377777775;(2)where Ymn (h, /) is the spherical harmonic function of order n(n¼ 0, 1,…, N) and degree m (m¼n, nþ1,…, 0, 1,…,n), which is defined asYmn h;/ð Þ ¼ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi2nþ 14pn mð Þ!nþ mð Þ!sPmn cos hð Þeim/; (3)where Pmn () is the associated Legendre functions, i is theimaginary unit, and ()! is the factorial operator.Different modes of the spherical harmonic functionrepresent different spatial patterns. For example, the firstmode Y00 (h, /) represents a monopole pattern, the sphericalharmonic of the order n¼ 1 are dipole patterns, and highermodes have more complex patterns (Rafaely, 2015). Fora low frequency sound signal with long wavelength, theFIG. 1. (Color online) Diagram of the proposed method.3212 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 144 (6), December 2018 Zhao et al.spherical microphone array has little effect on the soundpropagation and most of the sound energy is focused in thefirst few modes of the spherical harmonic. For example, tak-ing k> 5D, the frequency f should be less than 344 Hz(k¼ c/f, c¼ 344 m/s is the speed of sound, D¼ 0.2 m) for thespherical microphone array to have little effect on the soundpropagation. However, for wind noise, the distribution of thenoise energy along the sphere shows more complex patterns.This will be illustrated by the experimental results inSec. III.In consideration of the abovementioned differencebetween the sound signal and wind noise in the sphericalharmonic domain, this paper proposes to mitigate wind noiseby applying a low pass filter to the spherical harmonic coeffi-cients, i.e.,p0nm ¼ wnm  pnm; (4)where p0nm are the filtered spherical harmonic coefficients,wnm¼[w00, w1(1), w10, w11,…, wNN]T are the low pass filtercoefficients. For brevity without loss of generality, a simplerectangular low pass filter in the spherical harmonic domainis used here, i.e.,wnm ¼1; l  M;0; l > M;(5)where l¼ n(nþ1)þmþ1 is the mode number, and M is thethreshold mode number above which the spherical harmon-ics are filtered out. The low pass filtering in the sphericalharmonic domain physically represents removing the higherorder more complex patterns in the spatial domain, butretaining the monopole or the first few simple patterns.After low pass filtering in the spherical harmonicdomain, the spatial domain signals can be derived from thelow pass filtered harmonic coefficients with the discreteinverse spherical Fourier transformp0 ¼ Yp0nm; (6)where p0 is the obtained sound signal after WNR. To quan-tify the WNR performance, WNR is defined as (Zhao et al.,2018)WNR fð Þ ¼ 10 log10P1 fð ÞP2 fð ÞdBð Þ; (7)where P1(f) and P2(f) are the power spectral density of thewind noise before and after reduction.It is noteworthy that the proposed method here is differ-ent from the beamforming methods. Beamforming methodsare essentially spatial filters, which pick up sound signalsfrom one direction and attenuate the signals from otherdirections. Therefore, for wind noise from the same directionas the sound signals, beamforming methods cannot reducewind noise without degrading the sound signals. In contrast,the proposed method utilized the difference in spatial dis-tribution between the sound signals and wind noise, whichis independent of the sound signal direction. Even if thewind noise comes from the same direction as the sound sig-nals, the wind noise can still be reduced with the proposedmethod.The advantage of the proposed method is that thedesired sound signal can be extracted from wind noise evenwhen the sound signal is much lower than the wind noise.In addition, contrasting with existing WNR structures, e.g.,large spatial filters (DeWolf et al., 2013) and wind fenceenclosures (Abbott et al., 2015), the proposed method usesonly a portable spherical microphone array, which is conve-nient for outdoor noise measurements. Finally, the proposedmethod is flexible and can be extended to spherical beam-forming for future sound source localization. The feasibilityof the proposed method will be verified by experiments anddiscussed in Sec. III.III. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONSA. Experiment setupThe experiments were performed in an anechoic cham-ber with the experimental setup illustrated in Fig. 2. A com-mercial axial fan was used to generate wind noise and aB&K type 4295 omnidirectional loudspeaker was employedto produce the sound signal. A Visisonics spherical micro-phone array with 64 microphones on a 20 cm diameter rigidsphere was utilized to measure the pressure fluctuations dueto the sound signal and wind noise (VisiSonics, 2015). Thefrequency range of the Panasonic WM-61 A electret con-denser microphone used in the Visisonics spherical array is20 Hz16 kHz. The spherical microphone array was placedin the middle of the anechoic chamber, and the fan and theFIG. 2. (Color online) Experimental setup.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 144 (6), December 2018 Zhao et al. 3213loudspeaker were both 1.4 m away from the spherical micro-phone array. The fan was located at a direction of (90, 0)relative to the spherical microphone array, where (h, /)denotes the elevation angle and azimuth angle. The loud-speaker was placed at a variety of positions, but only resultsfor the same direction as the fan (90, 0) are presented herefor brevity because the results for other directions aresimilar.In the experiments, the sound signal was recorded firstwhen the loudspeaker was active without the fan running,and then the wind noise was recorded when the fan was run-ning alone. Finally, the sound signal, contaminated withwind noise, was recorded with both the loudspeaker and fanactive. The characteristics of the sound signal and windnoise were analyzed in the spherical harmonic domain first,and then the difference between them was utilized to filterout wind noise in the spherical harmonic domain.Figure 3 compares the recorded time domain signals atthe front of the sphere near the stagnation point (100, 0)and at the rear of the sphere (100, 180). It can be observedfrom Fig. 3(a) that the low frequency sound signal at 150 Hzis similar at both the front and rear of the sphere, indicatingthat the sound signal is uniform around the sphere. The timeaxis in Fig. 3(a) is zoomed to be 0–0.1 s for the waveformdetails to be observed. In contrast, Fig. 3(b) shows that thewind noise at the front of the sphere is much higher than thatat the rear, implying a complex distribution pattern of windnoise around the sphere. The correlation coefficients of thewind noise across each pair of microphones are found to beless than 0.3, showing that the wind noises are uncorrelatedaround the sphere.Figures 3(c) and 3(d) present the wind noise contami-nated sound signal when the sound pressure level (SPL) ofthe sound signal is 10 dB higher and 3 dB lower than thewind noise, respectively, and clearly show that the soundsignal is significantly distorted by the wind noise in the timedomain. It is noteworthy that in Fig. 3(c), the sound signal isa tonal signal at 150 Hz, which is higher than the wind noiseat 150 Hz. However, the wind noise is broadband signals, sopressure fluctuations of the wind noise in the time domain islarger than the tonal sound signal. While the spectral andspatial characteristics of the wind noise and sound signalsare quite distinct, separation is difficult in the time domain.Hence, on the basis of the spherical microphone signals, theFIG. 3. (Color online) Comparison of the time domain signals measured at the front (100, 0) and the rear (100, 180) of the rigid spherical microphonearray: (a) the 150 Hz tonal sound signal, (b) the wind noise, and the wind noise contaminated sound signal when the sound signal is (c) 10 dB higher, and (d)3 dB lower than the wind noise. The mean wind speed at the spherical microphone array is U¼ 4.2 m/s.3214 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 144 (6), December 2018 Zhao et al.analysis was performed in the spherical harmonic domainin Sec. III B.B. Sound signal in the spherical harmonic domainThe measured sound pressure are substituted into Eq. (1)to calculate the spherical harmonic coefficients pnm, and theresults for the sound signal without the fan running are shownin Fig. 4 at 150 and 500 Hz, respectively. In the calculation,the sample length for spherical harmonic transform was 1 swith a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz. The fast Fourier trans-form (FFT) length was 65 536, which is the next power of 2 ofthe sample length. For time dependent sound signals and windnoise, the proposed method can be applied every second.Therefore, a nearly real time noise monitoring system can bebuilt based on the proposed method for long term measure-ments. The highest order N¼ 6, so there are L¼ (Nþ1)2¼ 49modes in the spherical harmonic decomposition. The abscissamode number in Fig. 3 is l¼ n(nþ1)þmþ1, where l¼ 1 rep-resents the first mode Y00(h, /) and the l¼ 49 indicates thehighest mode YNN(h, /).Figure 4(a) shows that the spherical harmonic coeffi-cient for the first mode is much larger than that for highermodes at 150 Hz, indicating that the sound energy is predom-inantly in the first mode. To quantify the percentage of soundenergy contained in the first L0 modes, the cumulativeenergy ratio is calculated asR ¼XL0l¼1Cl2XLl¼1Cl2 100%; (8)where Cl denotes the lth spherical harmonic coefficient, L isthe total number of spherical harmonic modes. The accumu-lative energy ratio for the sound signal at 150 and 500 Hzcorresponding to Fig. 4 is summarized in Table I. It is clearthat 93.0% of the sound energy is contained in the first modeat 150 Hz.In the acoustic measurements, the error in the SPL iswithin 0.5 dB if 90% of the sound energy is captured. Thisimplies that the measurement accuracy can be restricted to0.5 dB by neglecting the higher modes but only retaining thefirst mode. To further verify this result, the low pass filter inthe spherical harmonic domain with M¼ 1 is used in Eq. (4)to calculate the filtered spherical harmonic coefficients,which are substituted in Eq. (6) to obtain the filtered signal.Comparison of the filtered signal with the original signal inFig. 5(a) shows that the original SPL at 150 Hz is clearlyextracted from the first mode with an error of 0.4 dB.Similarly, Fig. 4(b) shows that at 500 Hz, the sphericalharmonic coefficients in the first few modes are much largerthan those in higher modes, and Table I shows that 92.8%sound energy is focused in the first four modes. A low passfilter in the spherical harmonic domain with M¼ 5 andM¼ 1 is applied and the filtered signal compared with theoriginal signal in Fig. 5(b). It can be seen that the desiredSPL at 500 Hz can be extracted from the first five modeswith an error of 0.3 dB. However, if only the first mode isutilized, the restored SPL is 5.5 dB lower than the originalsignal, which indicates that some of the sound energy is lostin the process.The above results demonstrate that over 90% soundenergy is contained in the first spherical harmonic mode at150 Hz and in the first four modes at 500 Hz. Hence, a lowpass filter in the spherical harmonic domain can restore theoriginal SPL with an error less than 0.5 dB, and the thresholdmode number M needs to be tuned for different frequencysound signals. For higher frequency sound signals, highermodes are needed to restore the SPL, as shown in Table I.However, in the application scenario of WNR, the frequencyrange below 500 Hz is of greater interest because previousmeasurement results showed that wind noise above 500 Hzis below 40 dB in both indoor and outdoor environments(Zhao et al., 2016, 2017a).C. Wind noise in the spherical harmonic domainThe wind noise was measured when the fan was runningalone. In the experiment, the fan ran at three differentFIG. 4.

The spherical harmonic coefficients at frequencies150 and 500 Hz are shown in Fig. 6 for the wind speed of4.2 m/s. It seems that the spherical harmonic coefficients forthe wind noise do not have a clear pattern and the energy isirregularly distributed along the mode number in the spheri-cal harmonic domain, which is different from that for thesound signals shown in Fig. 4. To quantify the difference,Table II summarizes the cumulative energy ratio for thewind noise at different wind speeds.It can be seen that less than 1% wind noise energy iscontained in the first mode at 150 Hz, while less than 10%wind noise energy is contained in the first four modes at500 Hz. This is dramatically different from the sound signalsin Table I, where over 90% of sound energy is contained inthe first mode at 150 Hz, and in first four modes at 500 Hz.In the acoustic measurements, if less than 1% and 10% windnoise energy are retained, the WNRs are over 20 and 10 dB,respectively. Therefore, in comparison with Tables I and II,more than 20 and 10 dB WNR are expected at 150 and500 Hz, respectively, with a measurement accuracy of thedesired SPL within 0.5 dB.Figure 7(a) presents the magnitude of the spherical har-monic coefficients of the wind noise at different modes andfrequencies below 1000 Hz. This shows that the wind noiseis distributed irregularly in the spherical harmonic domain ateach frequency from 10 to 1000 Hz. This implies that if thesound signal dominates in the lower order modes, then thewind noise can be reduced using the proposed low pass filterapproach in the spherical harmonic domain by filtering outthe higher modes. The filtered results with different thresh-old mode numbers are compared with the original signal inFig. 7(b), which shows that the wind noise is reduced in thewhole frequency range from 10 to 1000 Hz by the proposedlow pass filtering in the spherical harmonic domain.This can be observed more clearly from Fig. 8(a) for theWNR as a function of frequency. In addition, more windnoise is attenuated when fewer modes are used in the lowpass filtering, as indicated in Fig. 8(b), where the overallWNR in the whole frequency range 10–1000 Hz is shown asa function of the threshold mode number. The overall WNRdecreases from 19.0 to 3.5 dB as the threshold mode numberFIG. 5.

Acoust. Soc. Am. 144 (6), December 2018 Zhao et al.increases from one to 48. It is noteworthy that maintainingthe first spherical harmonic coefficient in the proposedmethod is equivalent to spatial averaging along the sphere(Rafaely, 2015). The spatial averaging provides the largestWNR, which is obtained by using the proposed low pass fil-ter method in the spherical harmonic domain with M¼ 1. Itcan be used as a reference level to be compared to the resultswith other spherical harmonic orders.The above results demonstrate that the spherical har-monic coefficients for the wind noise are irregularly distrib-uted at each frequency in the spherical harmonic domain, asopposed to the sound signal where the sound energy domi-nates in the first few spherical harmonic modes. This differ-ence can be utilized to reduce wind noise while retaining thedesired sound signal with the proposed low pass filtermethod in the spherical harmonic domain.The physical reason for the difference between soundsignal and wind noise is due to different generation mecha-nism between them. The sound signal propagates as anacoustic wave, which has the diffraction property, e.g., thesound wave can propagate beyond obstacles (the sphericalmicrophone array here) when the wavelength is larger thanthe obstacle. This explains that the sound pressure at thefront and rear of the sphere are similar, as shown inFig. 3(a). However, the wind noise is caused by turbulentfluctuations, which is convected by the mean air flow.Different from wave propagation, the flow convection can-not diffract beyond obstacles, so the wind noise at the frontis much larger than that at the rear of the sphere, as shown inFig. 3(b). The different physical mechanisms of sound waveand wind noise cause the different characteristics in thespherical harmonic domain. In addition, the mean windspeed is much lower than the speed of sound, hence the tur-bulence wavelength is much smaller than the acoustic wave-length. This may also contribute to the difference betweensound signal and wind noise in the spherical harmonicdomain, which will be studied in detail in the future.D. Wind noise reduction (WNR) in the sphericalharmonic domainTo investigate the performance of the proposed spheri-cal harmonic domain low pass filter method when retrievingat sound signal from wind noise, a noisy sound signal wasrecorded with the spherical microphone array with both theloudspeaker and fan operating. A single-tonal sound signalat different frequencies was played through the loudspeakerto conduct two sets of experiments.In the first set of experiments, the SPL of the soundsignal was higher than the wind noise and the results areshown in Fig. 9, where the spherical harmonic coefficientsFIG. 7.

Am. 144 (6), December 2018 Zhao et al. 3217are presented for the noisy sound signal when the frequencyof the sound signal is 150 and 500 Hz, respectively. InFig. 9, the SPL of the desired sound signal is 10 and 8 dBhigher than the wind noise at 150 and 500 Hz, respectively.In this case, the difference between the sound and the windnoise in the spherical harmonic domain can be observedbecause the sound energy is higher than the wind noise atthe same frequency, as illustrated by the red marker ellipsesin Figs. 9(a) and 9(b). On the other hand, the wind noiseenergy is irregularly distributed across the frequency rangein the spherical harmonic domain, which is consistent withFig. 7(a).These observations indicate that the wind noise can bereduced by the proposed low pass filter method in the spheri-cal harmonic domain as discussed in Sec. III C. The low passfiltered results are compared with the original signal inFigs. 9(c) and 9(d) for the single-tonal sound of frequency150 and 500 Hz, respectively. It can be observed fromFig. 9(c) that when only the first mode is kept in thespherical harmonic domain, the wind noise is reduced by19.2 dB across the whole frequency range from 10 to1000 Hz and the desired SPL at 150 Hz is retained with anerror of 0.5 dB. For the 500 Hz tonal sound in Fig. 9(d), withonly the first mode is retained in the spherical harmonicdomain (M¼ 1), the wind noise is significantly reduced by19.2 dB but the desired sound signal is also degraded by5.5 dB. When the first five modes are retained in the spheri-cal harmonic domain (M¼ 5), the wind noise is reduced by13.0 dB across the whole frequency range from 10 to1000 Hz, and the desired SPL is degraded by 1.0 dB.The above results demonstrate that the proposed lowpass filter method in the spherical harmonic domain canreduce the measured wind noise by 13.0 dB without degrad-ing the sound signal when the SPL of the sound signal ishigher than the wind noise. In practical applications, the SPLof the sound signal might be lower than the wind noise. Inthis situation, the difference between the sound signal andwind noise cannot be seen in the spherical harmonic domain,as illustrated by Figs. 10(a) and 10(b). However, the spheri-cal harmonic domain low pass filtered results in Figs. 10(c)and 10(d) demonstrate that the proposed method can stillextract the desired sound signal from wind noise. For the150 Hz tonal sound signal with a SPL of 84 dB (3 dB lowerthan the wind noise), the low pass filtered results with M¼ 1and M¼ 5 obtain the same SPL of 84 dB at 150 Hz inFig. 9(c). For the 500 Hz tonal sound signal with a SPL of71 dB (8 dB lower than the wind noise), the low pass filteredresults with M¼ 5 and M¼ 10 derive almost the same SPLof 70 dB at 500 Hz, which are both about 5 dB higher thanthat with M¼ 1 as shown in Fig. 9(d).FIG. 9.

The sound signal at 150 and 500 Hz are 10 and 8 dB higher than the wind noise, respectively.3218 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 144 (6), December 2018 Zhao et al.To further evaluate the performance of the proposedmethod, a multi-tonal sound signal consisting of 125, 250,and 500 Hz sounds was recorded in the presence of windnoise. The SPL of the 125 Hz sound was 94 and 7 dB higherthan the wind noise, the SPL of the 250 Hz sound was 82 dBwhich is the same level as the wind noise, and the SPL of the500 Hz sound was 72 and 2.5 dB lower than the wind noise.The spherical harmonic domain low pass filtered signalswith different threshold mode numbers are compared withthe original signal in Fig. 11. It can be seen that when onlythe first mode is retained (M¼ 1), the error for 250 and500 Hz sounds is 1.5 and 3.0 dB, respectively, although theerror for the 125 Hz sound is within 0.5 dB. When the firstfive modes are retained (M¼ 5), the error is within 1.0 dBfor all the three tonal signals, and the wind noise is reducedby 10 dB. With more than five modes retained (e.g., M¼ 10),there is almost no further improvement in the measurementaccuracy of the desired sound signals, but the WNR isdecreased by 3 dB. Therefore, the threshold mode numberM¼ 5 is considered appropriate for this case, with a 10 dBWNR and measurement error within 1.0 dB.In summary, the above results demonstrate that the pro-posed low pass filter method in the spherical harmonicdomain can extract the desired sound signal from the noisysignal even when the SPL of the sound signal is lower thanthe wind noise. In theory, more than 20 and 10 dB measuredWNR are expected at 150 and 500 Hz, respectively, with ameasurement accuracy of the desired SPL within 0.5 dB, asshown in Tables I and II. In the experiments, 19.2 and13.2 dB WNRs were observed at 150 and 500 Hz, respec-tively, with the measurement accuracy of the desired SPLwithin 1.0 dB. Experimental results with the multi-tonalsound signals show a WNR of 10 dB with the measurementerror within 1.0 dB for all three tonal sounds.FIG. 10.

Soc. Am. 144 (6), December 2018 Zhao et al. 3219The feasibility of the proposed method for outdoorWNR was verified by an outdoor experiment, which is notshown here for the sake of brevity. Although the turbulencelength scale of outdoor wind is much larger than that of thewind from the fan in this paper, the results obtained by theproposed method are similar. The physical reason is thatthe proposed method utilized the different properties ofsound signals and wind noise. Wind noise is the turbulentfluctuations convected by the mean air flow, rather thanpropagating acoustic wave, therefore it cannot diffract to therear of the sphere. Therefore the property of wind noise andsound signal is much different in the spherical harmonicdomain, which is utilized by the proposed method for WNRwithout degradation of sound signals.IV. CONCLUSIONSThis paper utilized a portable rigid spherical micro-phone array to mitigate wind noise without degrading theSPL of the desired sound signal to be measured. The windnoise was found to be irregularly distributed in the sphericalharmonic domain at each frequency, contrasting with thesound signal that dominates in the first few spherical har-monic modes. A low pass filter method in the sphericalharmonic domain was proposed to reduce wind noise whilepreserving the SPL of the desired sound signal. Experimentalresults showed a 19.2 and 13.2 dB WNR at 150 and 500 Hz,respectively, with the measurement error of the desired soundsignal within 1.0 dB, even when the SPL of the sound signalis 8 dB lower than the wind noise. The proposed method wasalso validated with the measurements of the multi-tonal soundsignals in the presence of wind noise, which showed a 10 dBWNR with the measurement error within 1.0 dB. Future workwill extend the proposed method to sound source localizationusing beamforming algorithms in the spherical harmonicdomain.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSProfessor John Davy and Dr. Christopher Preston ofCSIRO are acknowledged for their support in the experiments.This research was supported under the Australian ResearchCouncil’s Linkage Project funding scheme (LP140100740).Abbott, J., Raspet, R., and Webster, J.
