ABSTRACT: 
This paper presents the study of non-classical nonlinear response of fiber-reinforced composites. Nonlinear elastic wave methods such as nonlinearresonant ultrasound spectroscopy (NRUS) and nonlinear wave modulation spectroscopy have been used earlier to detect damages in several materials. It was observed that applying these techniques to composites materials becomes difficult due to the significant inherent baseline nonlinearity. Understanding the non-classical nonlinear nature of the composites plays a vital role in implementing nonlinear acoustic techniques for material characterization as well as qualitative nondestructive testing of composites. Since fiber reinforced composites are orthotropic in nature, the baseline response variation with fiber orientation is very important. This work explores the nature of the inherent nonlinearity by performing nonlinear resonant spectroscopy (NRS) in intact unidirectional carbon/epoxy samples with different fiber orientations with respect to major axis of the sample. Factors such as frequency shifts, modal damping ratio, and higher harmonics were analyzed to explore the non-classical nonlinear nature of these materials. Conclusions were drawn based on the experimental observations.

INTRODUCTION The use of composites has increased exponentially in the past decade especially in aerospace and energy sectors. With increasing demand for light weight but strong materi- als, composites seem to be a very effective solution. Fiber re- inforced composites such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) are extensively used in the manufacturing sector. By using these materials, we make ourselves susceptible to the complexity of inspecting structures made from these materi- als. The field of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) has been used to catalogue various techniques for both inspection and characterization of metals. In the recent decade, techniques such as ultrasonics, thermography, radiography, etc., have been extended for composites in an attempt to create such a catalogue.1,2 Ultrasonics stands out as one of the best NDE techniques for composites and has been explored by many researchers including the use of guided waves.3–8 Typically, the damage would initiate in the form of matrix micro- cracking, matrix crushing, fiber-matrix debonding, etc. These defect initiators are very small and difficult to detect using traditional NDE techniques. For a tighter quality con- trol and damage prognosis, detecting precursor to damage is very vital. Precursors such as micro-cracking or low impact delaminations are very important in determining the fatigue life of the structure. To meet this requirement several researchers have used nonlinear acoustic techniques such as nonlinear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (NRUS) and nonlinear wave modulation spectroscopy (NWMS). These belong to a class of techniques called nonlinear elastic wave spectroscopy (NEWS) first devised by Guyer and Johnson.9 With higher excitation amplitudes some materials begin to act nonlinearly and deviate from linear elastic behavior even in the absence of a defect. This type of response was first reported for pristine rock and geomaterials by Guyer and Johnson.9 They predicted that NEWS techniques can also be used for inspection of damaged materials since the character- istic response of damaged and geomaterials were similar. They called this class of materials as mesoscopic materials where the elastic behavior was controlled by mesoscopic ele- ments along the grain boundary. Following this, several researchers have used NEWS techniques to detect and quan- tify damage in composites and other materials.10–19 Van Den Abeele demonstrated the use of NEWS techniques for detecting damage in fiber cemented plates. The hysteresis behavior along with non-classical nonlinear indicators were summarized.10,11 Impact damage in composite laminates and sandwich panels was investigated by Meo.14,15 Micro-crack density from heat damage was quantified using a nonlinear parameter by Van den Abeele.16 Aymerich17 studied the effect of impact damage on nonlinear modulation response. It was observed that clamping force for a cantilever beam affects the nonlinear response. Novak18 studied the evolution of nonlinear response (which was defined as read factors) for different damage states. Layered composites constitute multiple layers of fibers, fiber-fiber overlap, and fiber-matrix interface, etc. This would lead one to believe that composites may exhibit a)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

The pres- ent article does not explore the possibilities of using nonlin- ear acoustic methods for damage detection in composites since it has been performed by various researchers.14–19 Rather, it focuses on studying the inherent baseline nonli- nearity of fiber-reinforced composites, which is the nonlinear response of the material in its intact state. Knowledge of baseline nonlinearity becomes very important when nonlin- ear techniques are used for damage detection. Composites are primarily composed of binding materials (epoxy) and reinforcements (fibers). Assuming perfect bonding between fibers and epoxy and between multiple layers, the entire ma- terial can be treated as a continuum and an effective stiffness matrix can be used to describe the material. It is well known that by the same argument unidirectional laminates exhibit transversely isotropic properties, and composites in general can be described as orthotropic materials. Hence changing the fiber orientation of a unidirectional laminate would result in change in the stiffness matrix as well as the nonlinear response. To observe this phenomenon three fiber orienta- tions were chosen, i.e., 0, 45, and 90, since these are standard fiber orientations chosen for making cross ply [0/ 90] or [45/-45], or quasi-isotropic laminate [0/45/-45/90]. Nonlinear resonant spectroscopy (NRS) was used to charac- terize the nonlinear response of different samples used in this study. Standard parameters such as resonant frequency shifts and modal damping ratio variations which have been used by several other researchers were used to comment on the influence of fiber orientation on the baseline nonlinear response. Higher harmonic measurements were also used to analyze the nonlinear response. II. BACKGROUND The nonlinear response of several materials both dam- aged and undamaged has been extensively explored by Johnson, Van Den Abeele, Guyer, TenCate, etc., from Los Alamos.9–12,20–23 Van Den Abeele et al.20 used a phenome- nological model to show that for a nonlinear hysteretic mate- rial, linear softening (i.e., linear decrease in frequency), a quadratic dependency of the third harmonic on fundamental and linear increase of attenuation can be observed. This for- mulation holds good for damaged materials where the elas- ticity is controlled by volumetric cracks, bond systems, and other features.16 Similar types of response was observed for rock and geomaterials by Johnson and Rasolofosaon21 who had reported a linear decrease in frequency. Guyer et al.22 performed a set of resonant bar experiments with geomateri- als and reported a linear dependence of frequency even at very low strains (108 e 5 107). But in some recent research by Pasqualini et al.,23 it was reported that rocks and other geomaterials exhibit different frequency shift responses depending on the strain magnitude; (a) low strain linear zone, where the material behaves linear elastic and no frequency shift exists; (b) mid-range strain classical nonlin- ear zone where a quadratic softening in frequency can be observed as shown by Landau;24 and (c) high strain non- classical non-equilibrium zone where the response is con- trolled by slow and fast-dynamics and linear softening can be observed. Pasqualini et al. showed that the linear soften- ing observed experimentally in the non-equilibrium zone is due to the material conditioning effects resulting from slow dynamics. P. A. Johnson (personal correspondence) later found out that damaged materials behave in a similar fashion and have three strain ranges as described by Pasqualini, i.e., a linear zone, a quadratic zone and a non-equilibrium zone with linear softening. A schematic representation of each zone has been shown in Fig. 1. The strain range used in the current work has also been compared to the range used by other researchers. The lowest excitation frequency as shown in the figure lies in the classical non-linear zone hence result- ing in a non-zero offset similar to results obtained by Van den Abeele.16 The fundamental question of whether composites belong to linear elastic, CNL or NCNL will be explored in this study. Based on the multi-material, multi-layered structure of composites, there are several factor that can influence in- herent nonlinearity, such as ply orientation or fiber direction, residual stress, quality of cure, manufacturing method and type of resin and fiber used. We restrict this work to under- standing the influence of fiber orientation on nonlinear response. III. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS A. Sample preparation Several factors listed out in the previous section are inter- dependent and can influence the nonlinear response of the laminate. Hence, to only observe the effect of fiber orientation and minimize the effect of all other factors, a 30 layer unidir- ectional laminate was fabricated and 25.4mm 152.4mm coupons were cut in three different orientations, namely, 0, FIG. 1. (Color online) A schematic of the three strain zones that was observed by Pasqualini (Ref. 23). The low strain linear zone exhibits no frequency shift, while quadratic softening can be observed in the classical non-linear zone, fol- lowed by linear softening in the NCNL zone. The strain ranges used by vari- ous researchers have been compared to the strain range used in this study. 618 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 137, No. 2, February 2015 Chakrapani et al.: Inherent acoustic nonlinearity of composites 45, and 90. Prepreg carbon/epoxy fiber/resin system was used as the material system and a hot press was used to fabri- cate the laminate. This procedure ensures a nominally consist- ent volume fraction throughout the laminate. Since the samples were cut from the same laminate, they were all sub- jected to the same manufacturing process, fiber/resin type, quality of cure, etc. The fiber direction is parallel to the length of the sample for “0,” at 45 to the length for “45” and perpendicular to the length for “90.” A schematic of the fiber direction and sample orientation is shown in Fig. 2. Since the first order bending mode was excited during experimentation, the prop- erties along the length of the sample will dominate the non- linear response. Hence, the fiber orientation along the length of the sample was chosen as the variable parameter. All sam- ples were inspected by performing immersion ultrasound C- Scans and no distinct defects were found. B. Experimental setup A schematic of the experimental setup used is shown in Fig. 3. The setup consists of a continuous waveform (CW) generator which sends a sinusoidal signal to the amplifier where the signal is amplified and sent to a magnetostrictive actuator which was used for exciting the sample. The sample was supported directly on the actuator as shown, with the head of the actuator at the geometric center of the sample. An accelerometer was used to measure the out-of-plane response of the sample and was placed at the edge of the sample. Wax was used to couple the actuator and the accel- erometer to the sample. The response from the accelerometer was sent to a lock-in amplifier to track the frequency. The output from the CW generator was used as a reference for the lock-in amplifier. Data from lock-in amplifier were sent to a computer for processing. IV. RESULTS Nonlinear resonant spectroscopy was performed by sweeping a broad frequency range to find the various natural modes and the lowest order mode was chosen. A 50Hz sweep was performed on either side of the chosen resonant peak for 30 s and data were collected at 16Hz, meaning 480 points over 100Hz, which gives a frequency step size of 0.2Hz. This was repeated for various levels of excitation voltages and plot- ted together against amplitude. Figure 4 shows the various res- onance curves for 0, 45, and 90. A varying degree of shift in the frequency can be observed based on the orientation of the sample. Since “0” has a resonant frequency much higher than that of “90,” the acceleration data obtained from accelerometer were converted into strain so as to normalize with resonant frequency. The laminate mounted directly on the actuator head was constrained and excited at the center. To understand the type of vibration the beam is undergoing for the given set of boundary conditions, a finite element modal analysis was performed. The boundary conditions cho- sen for the finite element analysis was that of a cantilever beam with half beam length. Modal analysis showed that the first order bending mode observed for a cantilever beam was nominally in the same range as the experimentally observed frequency. The accelerometer position will only affect the magnitude of the measured acceleration. So in all cases accel- erometer was placed at the end of the sample where max acceleration can be measured. Similarly the position of the ac- tuator head will change the length of the cantilever beam resulting in a change of strain magnitude. The strain-velocity expression used by Van Den Abeele16,25 for free-free type of boundary condition was modified for cantilever beam with half-length as shown in Eq. (1), to match the experimental boundary conditions, e  0:219 T f ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 12 p 1:875 L=2  2 v; (1) where v is the velocity determined by integrating the acceler- ation data over time, L and T are sample dimensions: 152.4mm 4mm, and f is the resonant frequency. Further, to determine attenuation or modal damping ratio (MDR),10 the MDR formula was used as shown in Eq. (2), MDR ¼ Q 1 2 ¼ fhw=f 2 ; (2) where fhw is the frequency width at half the peak amplitude of the resonant peak (f) at finite strain amplitude. MDR has been used by many researchers to show non-classical nonlin- ear responses.10 In the linear zone, MDR remains a constant FIG. 2. The schematic representation of the various samples used for experi- mentation are shown. Fiber direction is along the coordinate axis “0” as shown. Sample dimensions along with orientation are shown in the schematic. FIG. 3. A schematic of the experimental setup used is shown. The sample was excited by a magnetostrictive actuator, and acceleration was recorded using an accelerometer. J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 137, No. 2, February 2015 Chakrapani et al.: Inherent acoustic nonlinearity of composites 619 and does not change. At higher strains, a linear increase in MDR can be observed for NCNL materials. A. Frequency shift The shift in the frequency, i.e., Df¼ f  f0, where f0 is the lowest amplitude excitation frequency, was calculated for all three samples with the data obtained from the NRS tests, with the frequency shift being normalized to the reso- nant frequency at lowest excitation (Df / f0). The frequency shifts for 0, 45, and 90 is presented in Fig. 5. Maximum shift was observed for 90, followed by 45 and 0. All strain data were limited to 15 micro-strain. A nominally linear fre- quency shift was observed with increasing strain amplitude over the data range. This overall response is consistent with non-classical non-linear materials. Although a good linear fit over the entire strain can be observed, fits over smaller ranges have to be performed to observe changes in nonlinear behavior. Goodness of fit was measured in terms of R2 val- ues, which was defined as R2 ¼ 1 X i yi  fið Þ2   X i yi  yð Þ2   ; (3) where yi are the observed values, fi are the fit values, and y is the mean of the observed value. The presence of a quadratic softening zone was investi- gated by performing a pure quadratic fit on the experimental data starting from low strain to the high strain amplitude. A comparison between quadratic fit and linear fit over the low range for 45 laminate can be seen in Fig. 6. The R2 value for linear fit over the small range was 0.801 compared to 0.9834 for the linear fit over the entire range. This shows that a discontinuity exists, which is an indicator that the ma- terial does not exhibit linear softening over the entire range. The R2 value for a pure quadratic fit (0.89) was better than the R2 value for the linear fit (0.801) which suggest the pres- ence of the quadratic softening zone or the classic nonlinear zone. Information in the CNL zone can be affected by vari- ous experimental factors such as humidity, temperature, etc. Furthermore, because of a gradual transition from the CNL to NCNL zone, results will necessarily be influenced by both responses. The pure quadratic fits in the small range were extrapo- lated for the entire range and plotted against the experimen- tal data as shown in Fig. 7. A good quadratic fit can be observed for a certain strain range beyond which the FIG. 4. (Color online) Resonance curves for various levels of excitation amplitudes.

Note the logarithmic scale for strain. The error bars have also been plotted in the data. 620 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 137, No. 2, February 2015 Chakrapani et al.: Inherent acoustic nonlinearity of composites experimentally observed data deviate from the quadratic fit. Comparing the goodness of fit in the low strain range as 45, the quadratic fit R2 value for 0 was 0.61 compared to linear fit value of 0.969. This can be due to the gradual transition between CNL and NCNL zone as suggested earlier. Further, to get a good quadratic fit, data in the linear strain range and CNL range have to be measured as shown by Pasqualini. Since the data for 0 start in the CNL range and transition quickly to NCNL range within a short strain range, the R2 value for quadratic fit will be lower than the linear fit. However, there are sufficient points in the NCNL range for 0 to describe a good linear fit confirming the NCNL response. The quadratic fit R2 value for 90 was 0.965 com- pared to linear R2 value of 0.945 which is consistent with 45. To be able to truly characterize the linear, CNL and NCNL strain zones, a measurement similar to Pasqualini has to be performed over a large strain range under controlled environment. This is considered out of scope of this study since the objective is to characterize the NCNL zone of these materials. Linear softening with increasing strain amplitude indi- cates NCNL behavior. Further, the presence of two zones, namely, quadratic softening zone and non-equilibrium zone with linear softening at higher strains, suggests that these materials can be classified under NCNL type of materials. B. Modal damping ratio Since 0, 45, and 90 have different MDR values, rela- tive change in MDR was used as shown in Eq. (4), DMDR ¼ Q 1  Q10 2 ; (4) where Q1/2 is the MDR at higher strain amplitude, and Q0 1/2 is the MDR at the lowest excitation amplitude. The DMDR calculated from Eq. (4) was plotted for all three sam- ples against strain as shown in Fig. 8. A linear increase in MDR was observed for all samples with 90 exhibiting the maximum increase, followed by 45 and 0. The linear increase in MDR suggests NCNL characteristics. The de- pendency of MDR on the fiber orientation is consistent with results obtained from frequency shifts. C. Harmonic analysis To further explore the presence of non-classical behav- ior, a higher harmonic analysis was performed on each sam- ple. Frequency sweeps were performed to find the fundamental resonant frequency, and the amplitude of higher harmonics were measured for the given excitation voltage. The process was repeated for different excitation voltages. To explore the NCNL aspect, a pure cubic fit was performed on the third harmonic experimental data for all three orientations as shown in Fig. 9. A pure quadratic fit was also performed on the experimental data to compare with cubic fit. Fitting was performed from the low strain range to the high strain range due to the discontinuous nonlinear response as shown earlier in frequency shifts. R2 values were used to compare the good- ness of fit between the quadratic and cubic fits. From Fig. 9, it is evident that the third harmonic does not follow a cubic FIG. 6. (Color online) The frequency shift in lower strain range for 45 sam- ple. A pure quadratic fit and linear fits were compared using their respective R2 values. From the R2 values the quadratic fit seems to be better than the linear fit in this range. The R2 value for the linear fit over the entire range as shown in Fig. 5(b) is 0.983, but linear fit over the low strain range is 0.801, which shows the discontinuity in response. FIG. 7. (Color online) Frequency shift vs strain showing the two zones, namely, classical nonlinear and non-classical nonlinear. A pure quadratic fit is compared with experimental data to show the threshold strain where the material begins lose its quadratic nature and behave like a NCNL material. J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 137, No. 2, February 2015 Chakrapani et al.: Inherent acoustic nonlinearity of composites 621 dependency of the fundamental which suggests the absence of CNL characteristics. A pure quadratic fit seems to match the experimental data well for both 0 and 45. The quadratic R2 value for 0 was 0.989 compared to the cubic fit which was 0.66 which shows that a quadratic fit is better. Similarly, the quadratic R2 value for 45 was 0.9931 compared to 0.4771 for the cubic fit which shows a better quadratic fit. However for 90, the experimental response lies somewhere between a quadratic and cubic response since the quadratic R2 value is 0.861 compared to the cubic response of 0.964. This suggests contributions from both CNL and NCNL for the given excita- tion range. Although the third harmonic response for 90 is somewhat ambiguous, the increase in MDR and frequency shift of the sample are indicative of NCNL response. By fitting the data from low strain to high strain amplitude, it can observed that beyond a particular acceleration (strain) the third harmonic loses its classic nonlinear response (cubic depend- ency) and begins to exhibit non-classical nonlinear response (quadratic dependency). The third harmonic scaling quadratic with the fundamental suggests NCNL characteristics. V. DISCUSSIONS From the results in Sec. IV, it can be observed that com- posites exhibit NCNL characteristics. The frequency shift, MDR and harmonic analysis results are consistent and show that unidirectional fiber reinforced composites exhibit NCNL properties. It can also be noticed from Figs. 6 and 7 that there exists a CNL zone where quadratic softening can be observed. This is consistent with results presented by Pasqualini et al.23 The strain range used in this study is con- sistent with the range used by several researchers for NDE of materials.10,16 Although the third strain zone is contami- nated by slow dynamics and not well understood, the high response in this zone is very important while applying this technique as a NDE tool. Measurements in a much lower strain range can be affected by temperature and humidity. This is considered out of scope since the focus of this study is to simply explore the effects of fiber orientation on the non-classical nonlinear response. To understand the influence of the chosen mode, a finite element modal analysis was performed on 0 laminate to find the higher order shear or torsional mode. NRS experiments were repeated for the torsional mode and the results are shown in Fig. 10. The fundamental bending mode was observed at 974Hz while the torsional mode could be observed at 4345Hz. The bending mode shows a much smaller frequency FIG. 8. (Color online) Modal damping ratio increase for different orienta- tions showing a linear fit. Highest increase in MDR with increasing strain can be observed for 90 followed by 45 and 0, which is consistent with the frequency shift response. Note the logarithmic scale for strain. FIG. 9. (Color online) Third harmonic acceleration values have been plotted against fundamental acceleration values for (a) 0, (b) 45, and (c) 90. In each case a pure quadratic and cubic fit was also performed to investigate quadratic or cubic dependency. The difference in the scale of fundamental acceleration for 0 compared to 45 and 90 arises from different fundamental frequencies. The R2 values for cubic and quadratic fits have also been listed. 622 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 137, No. 2, February 2015 Chakrapani et al.: Inherent acoustic nonlinearity of composites shift compared to the torsional mode as seen Fig. 10. This sug- gests that shear or sliding action has a bigger role to play in the contributions towards NCNL behavior as predicted by Johnson.26 In the bending mode, fibers play the major role since it is a unidirectional laminate with fiber direction ori- ented along the length of the laminate. On the other hand, properties of matrix comes into the picture in the torsional mode and hence it can be conjectured that part of the NCNL behavior would be a matrix dominated property. Non-equilibrium dynamics, slow dynamics, etc. have remained a poorly understood phenomenon. Although phe- nomenological models have been used to show similar response, lack of physical models highlights the need for more work in this area. The authors are currently in the pro- cess of building a theoretical model to explain the NCNL behavior of fiber reinforced composites. One of the possible reasons for this behavior might be nonlinear viscoelastic na- ture of the epoxy or matrix. Matrix dependent properties vary with fiber orientation with 90 exhibiting maximum matrix dependent properties compared to 0 which has more fiber based properties. The matrix or epoxy used for fabricat- ing composites has been shown to exhibit nonlinear visco- elastic properties.27–29 Creep and stress dependent response have been shown earlier in viscoelastic materials.27 Youzera et al.29 developed a nonlinear viscoelastic model and per- formed a forced vibration analysis to show an increase in loss factor as a function of vibration amplitude. They reported no significant dependence between loss factor and amplitude for a 0 core, while 45 and 90 show a significant increase in loss factor with 90 exhibiting highest increase followed by 45. This is consistent with the results presented in this article. The authors feel that viscoelasticity may only explain part of the response and more understanding of non- equilibrium dynamics is needed. Physical interactions such as fiber-fiber interaction, fiber-matrix interface interaction, residual stress, porosity, crazing, etc., can contribute to a higher nonlinear response and have to be considered in a physical model. The influence of multiple layers or layered media will be reserved for future work. VI. CONCLUSIONS The current work focused on investigating the influence of fiber orientation on inherent acoustic nonlinearity of com- posites. The initial hypothesis was that fiber reinforced com- posites which can be multi-material, multi-layered structures may act like rock and other geomaterials in terms of nonlinear response, i.e., non-classical nonlinear in nature. NRS tests were performed by collecting resonant frequency sweeps for increasing excitation voltages. Based on the frequency shifts in the various strain zones, the responses were found to be similar to that of NCNL materials. It was observed that 90 had the highest shift in frequency, followed by 45 and 0. A linear increase in MDR was observed with 90 increasing the highest followed by 45 and 0 consistent with the frequency shift. Similarly the third harmonic scaled quadratic as a func- tion of the fundamental amplitude. These results show that composites demonstrate a NCNL nature and reveal how the fiber orientation can affect the non-classical nonlinear response of composites. This highlights the need for a baseline study to allow quantification of damage in unidirectional fiber reinforced composites. This also highlights the fact that while designing a composite structure which may be subjected to fi- nite strain vibrations, designers should be made aware of the effect of vibration amplitude on the response of the structure.
