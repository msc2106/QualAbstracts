ABSTRACT: 
1noThe paper explores the structure of Italian Revealed Comparative Advan- tages (RCA), focusing on the export structure itself, on its changes over time and on its degree of persistence. The analysis is developed with the use of visual statistical tools and nonparametric statistical techniques that allow to estimate the empirical distribution of the Balassa (1965) Index, and to track its dynamics during three decades, from the 1970s to present. The main results of the analysis are that the structure of Italian RCA is highly persistent, but is changing; the structure is very different when it is examined at a macro-regional level; the distribution is not so similar to the one of the NICs when it is examined at a high level of sectoral disaggregation. Finally, using export data disaggregated at the provincial level, we show that the persistence in the pattern of RCA appears to be positively related to the presence of industrial districts.openDe Benedictis, LucaDE BENEDICTIS, Luc.

INTRODUCTIONTHE structure of Italian exports – its characteristics, its changes over time, itscauses and implications in terms of income and growth, employment, andfragility with respect to domestic and international shocks – has been the issuearound which at least three generations of Italian economists have discussed anddisagreed over the last 30 years.If one has to attribute to one single cause the origin of this multi-faceted debate,that very cause would be the perplexity associated with the evidence of Italybeing, on the one hand, a large industrialised country, with per capita incomecomparable to the top high-income OECD members (World Bank, 2004) and, onthe other hand, being characterised by an export composition where traditionallow-skilled labour-intensive sectors (OECD, 2001; and Peneder, 2003) such asTextiles, Wearing Apparel, Leather Products, Furniture and Footwear still play arelevant role.

INTRODUCTIONTHE structure of Italian exports – its characteristics, its changes over time, itscauses and implications in terms of income and growth, employment, andfragility with respect to domestic and international shocks – has been the issuearound which at least three generations of Italian economists have discussed anddisagreed over the last 30 years.If one has to attribute to one single cause the origin of this multi-faceted debate,that very cause would be the perplexity associated with the evidence of Italybeing, on the one hand, a large industrialised country, with per capita incomecomparable to the top high-income OECD members (World Bank, 2004) and, onthe other hand, being characterised by an export composition where traditionallow-skilled labour-intensive sectors (OECD, 2001; and Peneder, 2003) such asTextiles, Wearing Apparel, Leather Products, Furniture and Footwear still play arelevant role. This anomaly in the Italian trade structure with respect to one of itsfellow members of the G7, and its high level of persistence, is what makes ofItaly a case in the international trading system.This paper describes the primary feature giving rise to this debate: the Italianexport composition and its evolution over time. The analysis makes use of therevealed comparative advantage (RCA) index associated with the name of BelaBalassa and, through non-parametric statistical techniques, estimates the empiricalThe author is very grateful to MIUR (PRIN PIE 2003) and JETRO for the ﬁnancial support and toGiancarlo Spagnolo for his encouragement.

The persistencein the pattern of RCA is then examined at the sectoral level using provincial data,controlling for the presence of industrial districts – characterised by a cluster ofsmall family ﬁrms, a network of information-sharing and participation in innova-tion, Marshallian externalities and other strong agglomeration incentives – as theorganisational form of ﬁrms.The main results of the analysis are that the structure of Italian RCA is indeedhighly persistent but is changing, and several sectors characterised by compara-tive disadvantage in the 1980s now show a comparative advantage; the distribu-tion of Italian RCA changes sharply when it is examined at a macro-regionallevel, showing that regional disparities inﬂuence the shape of density functionof national RCA; the sectoral composition of exports – when it is examined ata high level of sectoral disaggregation – is not so similar to one of the newindustrialised countries (NICs) exporting labour-intensive goods, as one would apriori expect. Finally, simple visual inspection of sectoral export data disaggregatedat the provincial level and a Galtonian regression with an interacting dummyvariable show that the persistence in the pattern of RCA appears to be positivelyrelated to the presence of industrial districts.Even if the analysis applies to Italian data, the technique used in the paper canbe easily replicated and applied to the study of the evolution of RCA of any otherpossible geographical entity, at the country, region or urban level.The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains a short review ofthe debate on the Italian trade anomaly. Section 3 describes and discusses thecharacteristics of the Balassa index of RCA, and in Section 3a the boundedversion of the index is used to compare Italian RCA to several industrialisedcountries. In Sections 3b and 3c the persistence of Italian product specialisationthrough a scatter plot is visualised and the characteristics of Italian overallspecialisation through the estimated density function of RCA are examined. InSection 3d Italian RCA is compared with one of a selection of NICs. Section 4extends the analysis to provincial data comparing, in section 4a, national RCAwith one of four Italian macro-areas, and then, in Section 4b, the persistence inthe Italian structure of comparative advantages is related with the diffuse pres-ence of industrial districts in provinces highly specialised in sectors at the core ofthe Italian structure of RCA. Section 5 concludes.2. THE ITALIAN TRADE ANOMALY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES:A DEBATE OF LONG STANDING IN A NUTSHELLWhy is a largely industrialised country, like Italy, exporting traditional low-skilled labour-intensive goods? From a pure trade theoretical point of view this isITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1681© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005a puzzling anomaly.1 Seeking for a possible answer, one can rely on at least threemain potential explanations of the actual structure of Italian comparative advant-ages: (a) the factor proportion theory of comparative advantages, associated withthe predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem; (b) the theory of dynamic scaleeconomies, Marshallian externalities, and agglomeration, related both to the neweconomic geography and to the literature on industrial districts; and (c) the theoryof vertical differentiation and quality ladders. Even if these three approaches areperfectly compatible with each other, it is better to keep them separated, in orderto highlight the key elements of each speciﬁc approach.Starting from factor proportion, the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem predicts thatItaly would specialise in traditional sectors – producing and exporting labour-intensive goods – if the country is a labour-abundant country. But, is Italy alabour-abundant country? A positive answer would be empirically supported onlyfor periods before the second half of the twentieth century (Graziani, 1989).Since the mid-1950s, Italy began a process of capital accumulation which broughtthe country almost to the same average level of capital-labour ratio as other largeindustrialised countries. Since then, according to the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem,Italy should export capital-intensive goods to the rest of the world. Why is thedegree of persistence of the Italian exports’ structure so high, in spite of thesubstantial change in factor endowments? Why is Italy still exporting what it wasexporting in the 1950s?De Benedictis and Padoan (1999) and Epifani (1999) both offer differentbut converging interpretations of the persistence of the Italian structure of com-parative advantages; both emphasise the role played by dynamic economies ofscale in making the Italian export composition sticky (Krugman, 1987). Bothshow how, in a Ricardian framework (De Benedictis and Padoan, 1999) or in aHeckscher-Ohlin framework (Epifani, 1999), with dynamic economies of scalethe country will become more and more efﬁcient in the production of the goodsit was initially exporting, so that the dynamics of productivity would lock-in thecountry to its initial comparative advantage. If learning-by-doing is quite effec-tive it can nullify the effect of a change in factor proportions on comparative1 Aside from trade theory, very many different explanations have been put forward by thenumerous social scientists that have discussed the issue over the years (Graziani, 1989; and Ginsborg,1989). The most acquainted are the heritage of national economic history (Rossi and Toniolo,1996) and the dualistic structure of the economy (Lutz, 1962), the role of family-owned ﬁrms(Burkart, Panunzi and Shleifer, 2002), the inefﬁciencies of both private and publicly owned largeﬁrms (De Cecco, 2004), the large share of small ﬁrms in the size distribution of ﬁrms (Pagano andSchivardi, 2003), the underdevelopment of the ﬁnancial system and the inefﬁciency of the legalsystem (Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales, 2005), the prevalence of the rentier over the innovator(Nardozzi, 2004), and the absence of industrial policy and the reliance on the strategic use of theexchange rate to enhance competitiveness (Guerrieri and Rossi, 2000). All these various features ofItalian development reinforce the traditional structure of comparative advantages emerging in the1950s.1682 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005advantages and the export structure would remain unchanged. If this is the case,Italy is still exporting traditional low-skilled labour-intensive goods not becauseit is a labour-abundant country but because it was a labour-abundant country.But, why is Italy characterised by such a high degree of learning-by-doing? Themost acquainted answer is the diffusion in the late 1950s of industrial districts(Becattini, 1999; and IPI, 2002) that allowed small ﬁrms to exploit dynamic scaleeconomies due to Marshallian externalities. Without such intensive clustering,small family ﬁrms would not have been able to increase productivity and tohorizontally and vertically differentiate their production.From the 1970s onwards, the Italian anomaly of an industrialised countrycharacterised by the predominance of clusters of small ﬁrms producing andexporting traditional goods generates an anti-cyclical debate on the consequencesfor a small open country to rely on an export-led growth strategy, while exportinglow-skilled labour-intensive goods.2 On the con side of the debate Conti (1978),Onida (1978), Modiano (1982) and Guerrieri and Rossi (2000), among manyothers, noticed that the characteristics of Italian exports composition had strongimplications in terms of national dependence on imported technology, a low rateof R&D investment, a limited incentive for small ﬁrms to grow in size, and anintrinsic weakness of the export-led strategy, associated to the low-income elas-ticity of Italian exports. Iapadre (1996) and de Nardis (1997) put the accent onthe relatively high rigidity of the Italian export structure and on the possible risksin terms of sluggish growth rate, low employment capacity, and fragility withrespect to exogenous shocks, such as the EMU or a drop in world demand,associated to it. On the pro side Becattini (1989 and 1999), Brusco and Paba(1997), and many others, highlighted the qualities of a social and economicstructure self-organised as a Marshallian district, and Signorini (2000) showsstrong and robust evidence of the efﬁciency of small ﬁrms clustered into localindustrial districts. Finally, Faini (2004) takes an equidistant position, noticingthat no empirical evidence supports the view of the Italian pattern of specialisa-tion being responsible for the declining export performance and, in general, forthe economic difﬁculties of the country.Nowadays, Italy is growing at an average rate of 1.5 per cent yearly – halfa point below the EU average rate – and that total factor productivity hasdecreased in the second half of the 1990s, while it accelerated in the US and inthe OECD countries, on average, the anti-cyclical debate on the Italian anomalyhas gained momentum again.Among the various reasons that have been put forward to explain why theItalian sectoral specialisation is now facing more severe limits than before (see2 One might go even further back in history, all the way to the end of the Roman Empire or to theVenetian crisis of the seventeenth century (Glamann, 1974; and Rossi and Toniolo, 1996) to ﬁndexamples of similar arguments on the role of the exports crisis on the decline of the State.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1683© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005FIGURE 1The Italian Anomaly: 1980s vs 1990sOnida, 1999, for an extensive review of the issue) the most common one is theﬁercer competition from the NICs, associated to an overvalued euro. A cause lessthought about is the change in the characteristics of the sectoral world’s demand.Figure 1 plots the rate of growth of the sectoral world’s imports against theBalassa index of Italian sectoral comparative advantages, the index that is usedthroughout the analysis and that will be more properly deﬁned in Section 3. Eachsector is identiﬁed by a circle whose size is proportional to the share of the samesectoral exports in total Italian exports; lighter circles correspond to the averagevalues in the 1980s, while black circles correspond to the average values in the1990s. The vertical line separates sectors characterised by comparative advantage(the ones with an index taking a value greater than one) from sectors with com-parative disadvantages. The two horizontal lines identify the average rate ofgrowth of the world’s demand for sectoral imports in the 1980s (the lighterdotted line) and in the 1990s (the darker dotted line). Sectors above the horizontalline show a rate of growth of world’s demand higher than the average. Thecurves are non-parametrically ﬁtted regression functions, weighted by the sectoralshare in total Italian exports.1684 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005The Italian anomaly is immediately evident. The sectors with higher compara-tive advantages, both in the 1980s and in the 1990s, are traditional low-skilledmanufactures (Footwear, Furniture, Leather, Apparel and Textiles) and theirshare in total exports is quite remarkable. In the 1980s, the world’s demand forproducts belonging to these sectors was growing faster than the sectoral average.In the 1990s, characterised by a drop in the world’s demand for imports, thesame sectors became relatively less internationally demanded, being substitutedby Electrical Machinery, Pharmaceuticals and Industrial Machinery. As the non-parametric curves show, the slope of the sectoral world’s demand with respectto Italian RCA has changed sign from the 1980s to the 1990s. The relationshipswitched from being largely positive to negative or insigniﬁcant, implying thatItaly’s product specialisation is in sectors now less internationally demanded.In the next section the details of both Italy’s product specialisation (Schott,2004) and overall specialisation (De Benedictis and Tamberi, 2004) will be listed,focusing both on the role of single sectors, and on the shape of the distributionof RCA. In order to describe how the structure of Italian exports has evolvedover time, product specialisation using a traditional measure of revealed com-parative advantages will be quantiﬁed. The goal will be to measure Italian RCA,to emphasise the role of single sectors, to estimate the distribution of RCA and itspersistence, and to compare it with the one of a group of OECD and NICs.3. ITALIAN REVEALED COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGESAmong the metrics used in the analysis of bilateral and multilateral tradeﬂows, the ﬁrst and still most widely used measure3 built on one single variableis the Balassa (1965) index of revealed comparative advantage (RCA).43 The literature on the appropriateness of different measures of comparative advantage and on theirtheoretical interpretation is wide. More discussion on the topic can be found in Bowen (1983),Ballance, Forstner and Murray (1987), Vollrath (1991) and Lafay (1992). See also Iapadre (2001),Laursen (2002, Ch. 3) and OECD (2005) for a general discussion on the various measures used inthe literature.4 The use of the Balassa index has its own advantages and disadvantages. It is easy to construct, itsinterpretation is intuitive (see the Appendix for a simple application and De Benedictis and Tamberi,2004, for a more analytic explanation), and it is largely used (see Yi, 2003, for a recent application)in very different contexts and applied to different variables, such as employment, value added,productions, patents (see Kim, 1995, for an application of the index to US regional employment).On the other hand, many authors have identiﬁed some shortcomings inherent in the index (Bowen,1983; and Yeats, 1985) and the link between the index and the theory of comparative advantages isproblematic (Vollrath, 1991). Several alternatives are possible, the most commonly used in theanalysis of comparative advantages are the ones based on both export and import ﬂows (i.e. thenormalised trade balance). The use of those measure is not advisable when the analysis is structuredon a regional basis. Import marketing locations rarely coincide with the regional locations whereimported goods are sold, and the information contained in imports data can be misleading.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1685© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005The traditional way of deﬁning the Balassa index – which is indicated asb – is: bX XX Xijtijt wjtit wt //= , (1)where – for every time period t considered – i denotes a speciﬁc country, windicates the world economy (i.e. the entire set of countries considered in theanalysis), and j is a speciﬁc sector. b is, therefore, a sectoral relative exportmeasure in terms of share of world exports. Since the numerator ranges from0 (the country is not exporting products belonging to that particular sector) to1 (the country is an international monopolist in such category of products), andthe denominator 1dXXitwt = – which is the economic dimension of the country,in export terms – also ranges from 0 to 1, then b ranges between 0 and d.Therefore, equation (1) – omitting subscripts – can be written as:b = c · d, (2)where c is the sectoral market share of country i in sector j, and d is the timevariant upper bound of b (common to all sectors j). From equation (2) we can saythat when b ∈ [0, 1) (which is equivalent to saying that c < 1/d) the country hasa comparative disadvantage in sector j; while it has a comparative advantage insector j if b ∈ (1, d] (when c > 1/d). The demarcation value is given by the condi-tion c = 1/d, corresponding to the case where the country displays a sectoralmarket share equal to its total share of world exports.For every country, the distribution of b is characterised by a ﬁxed lower bound(0), a time variant upper bound (d), and an invariant demarcation value (1). DeBenedictis and Tamberi (2004) give a detailed description of the characteristicsof the distribution of b. For the current argument, the main feature of the distribu-tion is that its shape is asymmetric (as can be seen from the decentred position ofthe demarcation line in Figure 1, where b is used as the metric of the horizontalaxis), and that the degree of right skewness is inversely related to the country’sshare of total world exports, 1/d (i.e. small countries tend to be characterised byhigh maximum levels of sectoral b’s).In order to sharply reduce the degree of asymmetry of the distribution, theindex can be made bounded using the transformation:5 bbbB ( )( )=−+11. (3)1686 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005The bB version of b – where the superscript B stands for bounded – rangesbetween [−1, 1], and its demarcation value is at 0. The above transformation isuseful for visual purposes, giving emphasis both to comparative advantaged andcomparative disadvantaged sectors, so we will use it throughout the analysis.Even if moving from b to bB leaves the rank-order of sectors invariant, theinterpretation of the numerical value of bB is less evident, so we will present theoriginal b-values in the Appendix.a. Italian RCA in the 1970s and in the 1990s: An International ComparisonIn this section bB is used to analyse the Italian product specialisation togetherwith the one of ﬁve other OECD countries, for comparison. In Figure 2, sixscatter plots have been collected for Italy, Spain, Japan, Germany, the US and theUK in order to compare trade structures and trade patterns internationally. Let ustake the ﬁrst plot on the upper left (Italy) as illustrative; the discussion extendswith the other ﬁve plots for analogy.On the horizontal axis we have the sectoral bB values for 1970, and on thevertical axis we have the corresponding bB values for 1998.6 The two lines drawnin correspondence of the demarcation value bB = 0 separate sectors with revealedcomparative disadvantage from sectors with revealed comparative advantage,and deﬁne four quadrants. The two quadrants along the main diagonal containsectors that modiﬁed their relative position, from comparative disadvantage tocomparative advantage (upper quadrant to the left) or vice versa (lower quadrantto the right). The two quadrants along the secondary diagonal contain sectors thatdid not modify their position in terms of comparative advantage (upper quadrantto the right) or comparative disadvantage (lower quadrant to the left). Relativechanges are evident inside each one of the four quadrants. The 45° dotted linevisualises a condition of pure persistence.7The data used in Figure 2 is collected by the OECD (2002), at the two-digitlevel of the SITC (rev. 2) classiﬁcation (see the Appendix for a description of the5 For a discussion of the advantages of this transformation see Laursen (2002) and Iapadre(2001). See also Brasili, Epifani and Helg (2000) and Mancusi (2001) for applications of the sametransformation to export and patent data, and Vollrath (1991) for an alternative log-transformation.A critical discussion of the various possible transformations is in De Benedictis and Tamberi(2001).6 The choice of the two years 1970 and 1998 – that correspond to the initial and the ﬁnal year ofthe time series – does not inﬂuence the results. The robustness of the analysis was veriﬁed to thechoice of initial and ﬁnal years, using 1971 and 1997 as alternatives. The exercise was alsoreplicated using ﬁve-year averages, but the effect was not remarkable.7 It is called pure persistence since it implies not only that Italy has not changed its structure ofRCA, but that also all other countries considered did not change their structure.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1687© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005FIGURE 2Comparative Advantage (1970–1998): Italy, Spain, Japan, Germany, USA, UKNote:() ‘Traditional sectors’; ( ) ‘advanced sectors’ and () ‘other’.Data Source: OECD, STAN database, 2002.data); the sectors included are 27 manufacturing sectors, that we have roughlydivided into ‘traditional sectors’, ‘advanced sectors’ and ‘other’,8 respectivelyindicated in Figure 2 by the symbols (), ( ) and ().8 The classiﬁcation is related to the OECD’s ‘high-tech’, ‘low-tech’ taxonomy, discussed in Peneder(2003). See column 1 of Table A1 in the Appendix for the correspondence among sectors and thetaxonomy’s classes.1688 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005The information content of Figure 2 is largely self-explanatory.9 Startingfrom Italy it is evident that it had, and still has, very strong RCA in ‘traditionalsectors’ such as Textiles, Wearing Apparel, Leather, Footwear, Furniture, andPottery and China, it has improved its RCA in many ‘traditional sectors’ (whichlie above the 45° dotted line) but not in the top ones (Footwear, and WearingApparel), and it has also improved its RCA in some ‘other sectors’ such asMachinery and Other Manufacturing. What is also remarkable is the persistencein the structure of comparative advantages: almost all sectors are in the twoquadrants along the secondary diagonal. The only other country that shows sucha high persistence (a low dispersion around the 45° line) is the US.The opposite case is represented by Spain. From the 1970s to the 1990s Spainchanged markedly its pattern of comparative advantages. Many sectors with apositive bB – ‘traditional sectors’ but not only – lie below the 45° line (withthe noteworthy exception of Non-metallic Products), while some sectors – both‘traditional sectors’ and ‘advanced sectors’ – moved from being comparativedisadvantaged to be comparative advantaged. Spain, which for many reasonscan be considered similar to Italy, followed, during the period considered, a verydifferent product specialisation path.On the other hand, Japan and Germany are somehow similar cases. Both havein common an export structure characterised by a limited number of sectors withcomparative advantages – both ‘advanced sectors’ (Non-electrical Machinery,Transport Equipment, and Professional Goods) and ‘other sectors’ (RubberProducts); in both cases a conspicuous number of sectors moved from a positivebB value to a negative one; both countries are characterised by a high dispersionaround the 45° line.The US follows a fairly stable path. The large majority of sectors lie close tothe 45° line; as for Japan and Germany the value of the bB’s is quite small withonly one exception being Tobacco, with a bB around 0.5; ﬁnally, the sectorscharacterised by RCA are mainly ‘advanced sectors’.As for the US, the UK follows a fairly stable path, with the peculiarity of arelevant number of ‘traditional’ and ‘other sectors’ – such as Leather and Products,Footwear, Tobacco, Rubber Products, Non-ferrous Metals, Metal Products, andTransport Equipment – losing their original comparative advantage.This bird’s-eye view of RCA in six industrialised countries gives evidenceto the Italian product specialisation anomaly and to the persistence of thephenomenon. At the same time it offers two relevant insights. On the one hand,what is evident in Figure 2 is that the Italian top RCA ‘traditional sectors’, suchas Footwear and Wearing Apparel, decreased their bB values from 1970 to 1998,9 Both the choice of the level of sectoral disaggregation and the speciﬁc clustering is due toexpositional and visual purposes.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1689© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005while ‘other sectors’, such as Machinery, have increased their bB values. Nowadays,the Italian product specialisation is therefore characterised by an overall reduc-tion in relevance to ‘traditional sectors’, by a reproportion of relative weightsinside the category (more textiles and leather, less apparel and footwear), and bythe emergence of metallic and non-metallic products, machineries mainly used inthe production of traditional products. On the other hand, the relatively high levelof persistence in the structure of RCA is not a speciﬁc feature of Italian productspecialisation but is common to other counties as well, i.e. the US. We will comeback to both issues later on.b. Persistence and ChangeIn order to properly verify that the persistence of the Italian structure of com-parative advantages is not limited to across-product specialisation but extendsalso to within-product specialisation,10 we have to switch to a different inter-national data set, that should make it possible to deﬁne the bB values at the higherpossible disaggregation.The data set chosen is the UN-World Bank (1999) data set, includingCOMTRADE data on 193 exporting countries, with a sectoral disaggregationthat, at four digits of the SITC (rev. 2) classiﬁcation, includes 540 manufacturingsectors (see the Appendix for a description of the data set). From such data setone obtains very detailed information on sectoral RCA at the cost of losinginsights on the ﬁrst decade of our previous analysis, since the UN data set coversa time span of just 13 years, from 1986 to 1998.In Figure 3 we replicated the Italian scatter contained in Figure 2 using theUN-World Bank data set. The years considered are 1986 and 1998. Since alsowith these data the distribution of the b’s showed a strong right skewness wetransformed b’s in bB’s, so as to give emphasis both to comparative advantages(bB > 0) and disadvantages (bB < 0). We superimposed to the plot the continuousOLS regression line of bB1998 on bB1986.In Figure 3, the large majority of sectors are still located in the two quadrantsalong the secondary diagonal, containing sectors that did not modify their relativecondition in terms of comparative advantage (190 sectors; 35 per cent of totalsectors considered) or disadvantage (250 sectors; 49 per cent). Among the 190sectors in the upper left quadrant of Figure 3, 60 per cent of them (115 sectors)lie above the 45° line, indicating an increase in bB, and what is also worthnoticing is that sectors with revealed comparative disadvantage are much moredispersed around the 45° line than sectors with comparative advantages.10 A movement along the quality ladder would result in no change at all in across-product spec-ialisation, being hidden by its intra-product nature.1690 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005FIGURE 3Persistence of Italian Comparative Advantages (1986–1998)The most noticeable fact emerging from Figure 3 – and unobservable in highlyaggregated data – is that many sectors that were comparatively disadvantaged in1986 became comparatively advantaged in 1998 (66 sectors, 12 per cent), mov-ing from the lower quadrant along the secondary diagonal to the upper quadrantalong the main diagonal. An evidence obviously in contrast with the presumptionof a never changing pattern of RCA. Table 1 lists examples of the sectors movingfrom bB < 0 to bB > 0, and vice versa.Finally, the degree of persistence of the Italian structure of comparative advant-ages11 is anyway remarkable, even when using higher disaggregated data as in11 De Nardis (1997) measured the persistence of the Italian RCA testing the AR(1) characteristic ofthe various sectoral time series, ﬁnding very different autoregressive structures.Note:The dotted line is the pure persistence 45° line; the continuous line is the OLS regression:bB1986 = 0.001 + 0.83 · bB1998.Data Source: UN-World Bank database, 1999.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1691© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005TABLE 1Our Elaborations on UN-World Bank, TradeCAN Database, 1999SITC Sector bB1989 bB1998Code7841 Chassis ﬁtted with engines, for motor vehicles −0.369 0.5347851 Motorcycles, auto-cycles and cycles ﬁtted with motor −0.090 0.4666424 Paper and paperboard, cut to size or shape −0.157 0.4416591 Linoleum and similar ﬂoor coverings −0.222 0.3818421 Overcoats and other coats −0.093 0.3636579 Special products of textile materials −0.118 0.3586750 Hoop and strip, of iron or steel, hot and cold rolled −0.221 0.3365147 Carboxyamide-function compounds −0.022 0.3306282 Transmission, conveyor or elevator belts or belting −0.072 0.3257421 Reciprocating pumps −0.131 0.3256130 Furskins, tanned or dressed −0.213 0.3145825 Polyurethanes −0.092 0.3077913 Railway and tramway coaches, vans and trucks −0.615 0.2918483 Fur clothing (not including headgear) −0.420 0.2886417 Paper and paperboard, corrugated, creped, etc. −0.470 0.2617757 Electro-mechanical, domestic appliances 0.160 −0.0348922 Newspapers, journals and periodicals 0.048 −0.0875123 Phenols and phenol-alcohols 0.165 −0.1068462 Under-garments, knitted or crocheted, of cotton 0.245 −0.1298991 Articles and manufactures of carving or moulding material 0.158 −0.1518994 Umbrellas, parasols, walking-sticks 0.281 −0.1875836 Acrylic polymers, methacrylic polymers and acrylo-methacrylic 0.009 −0.1877112 Auxiliary plant for use with boilers of heading 0.008 −0.1898429 Other outer garments, men’s and boys’, of textile fabrics 0.210 −0.2106254 Tyres, pneumatic, new, of a kind normally used on motorcycles 0.265 −0.2267243 Sewing machines and furniture for sewing machines 0.033 −0.2296574 Elastic fabrics and trimmings 0.352 −0.2348959 Other ofﬁce and stationery supplies 0.089 −0.4106551 Knitted or crocheted fabrics, not elastic nor rubberised 0.537 −0.5305122 Cyclic alcohols 0.265 −0.5467511 Typewriters 0.274 −0.57212 The null hypothesis of 5 = 1 was tested using an F-test similar to the Chow test but the nullwas not accepted. In order to take into account the possible inﬂuence of outliers we also performeda resistant regression (using a median absolute deviation estimator), but the difference was notnoticeable.Figure 3. In the case of pure persistence the dotted 45° line and the continuous linecorresponding to the linear OLS would overlap, while they would be orthogonalin the case of complete structural change. In Figure 3 the two lines are very closeto each other, implying a high degree of persistence, on average. The estimatedβ is equal to 0.83 and is statistically signiﬁcant and different from one.12 If 5had been greater than one this would have meant that Italy would have become1692 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005more specialised in products where it was already specialised in the 1980s (andless specialised in products characterised by negative bB1986). Since 5 is lower thanone, the opposite tendency seems to be supported by the data: Italy is becomingless specialised in traditional sectors and new sectors are emerging.We will look for support for this ﬁnding – indicating both high relative persist-ence and some remarkable change in the distribution of Italian RCA – estimatingthe density function of bB in 1986 and 1998 and testing for the signiﬁcance of thechange occurred.c. Estimating RCA DensityIn this section more emphasis is given to the ordinal content of the Balassaindex of RCA, moving from the analysis of product specialisation to the one ofoverall specialisation. We will therefore study the shape and the dynamics of theoverall structure of the Italian RCA, leaving aside the intra-distributional changesthat have previously been observed. Using non-parametric statistics we will estim-ate the probability density function (PDF) of the Italian sectoral RCA. As forthe scatter plot in Figure 3, given the skewness of the b’s the analysis will becarried out using bB’s. A kernel density estimate will be used,13 adopting a Gaussiankernel function and a normal optimal smoothing parameter, as suggested bySilverman (1986) and Bowman and Azzalini (1997). Since the aim is to comparePDFs along time, the bandwidth of the PDF will be kept (the smoothing para-meter) constant: we will estimate it for 1986 and will also apply it to 1998. Theresults are set out in Figure 4.The vertical line in Figure 4 indicates the ﬁxed demarcation value, bB = 0; ifwe take such value as a focal point, it can be observed that the distribution isbell-shaped but still skewed, even on the bB dimension, and that the density ishigher around the demarcation value (in the interval −0.5 < bB < 0.5).Starting from 1986, the shape of the distribution is relatively centred and ischaracterised by high bB values in the right tail and by a noticeable bimodality.The principal mode is below the demarcation value, while the hump to the rightof the distribution (around bB = 0.2) indicates that a conspicuous number ofsectors were characterised by high bB values.The estimated PDF shows a noteworthy evolution in 1998. The major changeis that the overall distribution has moved to the right, with a small increase in thenumber of sectors with very low bB values and with a comprehensive increase inthe number of sectors with bB values around the median. A further major changeis that the secondary mode has switched position, moving from the left to the13 An intuitive explanation of the methodology applied to estimate the kernel densities is describedin the Appendix. See Silverman (1986) for a review of the topic.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1693© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005FIGURE 4Kernel Density of Italian RCA (1986–1998)Note:The vertical line is the demarcation value bB = 0; triangles indicate the location of the median in 1986 (light)and 1998 (black).Data Source: UN-World Bank database, 1999.14 The value of the median is −0.115 for bB1986, and −0.043 for bB1998.right, with sectors following a pattern of convergence towards the two modes.Finally, the median itself has moved to the right and is now closer to the demarca-tion value. Almost 50 per cent of the Italian sectors show a revealed comparativeadvantage.14The statistical signiﬁcance of the change through a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of stochastic dominance was tested. The null hypothesis that thedistribution function of bB1986 is not greater than the distribution function of bB1998was accepted with a p-value of 0.0275, indicating a signiﬁcant left shift in theposition of the distribution.1694 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005Hence, in spite of the relative high persistence of the Italian structure of RCAthe analysis of the density functions showed a signiﬁcant degree of mobility.Did this have any inﬂuence in terms of similarity with the RCA structure ofother countries? Can the inﬂuence of regional disparities on the national overallspecialisation be explored? Each issue will be discussed in turn in the next twosections.d. Similarity: OECD Countries and the NICsBeing highly specialised in traditional low-skilled labour-intensive sectors,Italy can be particularly sensitive to the growing relevance of Asian NICs ininternational markets. This increase in competition is frequently considered theproblem that small Italian ﬁrms are already facing, and calls for protection againstthe unfair competition of labour-abundant countries are becoming popular in Italy.The starting point of these claims is that Italy’s product specialisation is similarto those of the NICs and that they are competing on the same sectoral markets;the sharp reduction in Italian export shares is used as supporting evidence.While the second piece of evidence is incontrovertible, the ﬁrst one is lesscertain. Several authors (de Nardis and Traù, 1999; and De Benedictis and Tamberi,2000) have already stressed that underestimating the role of vertical differentia-tion in analysing trade competition between Italy and the NICs can seriouslymisrepresent the intensity in competition. A common way to assert it is to verifythe level of overlap in the structure of RCA.15 Table 2 contains the rank correla-tion of Italian RCA with a group of OECD countries and NICs, together with theautocorrelation of the same countries’ RCA along time.As far as Italy is concerned, its rank autocorrelation coefﬁcient is 0.91 at atwo-digit level and 0.80 at a four-digit level. It is the highest in the reducedsample used in Table 2. The coefﬁcient is, however, not very far from one of theUS (two-digit and four-digit levels) and, surprisingly, from the one of Japan16(four-digit level). What seems, therefore, to be relevant is not persistence per sebut persistence in a speciﬁc structure of RCA. In this case Italy is indeed ananomaly among the industrialised countries.The Italian rank correlation with respect to the other countries considered showsa negative sign in the case of the OECD countries and a positive one in the case15 A possible alternative is to compare unit values of sectoral exports. See de Nardis and Traù(1999) and Amighini and Chiarlone (2004) for applications to Italian RCA.16 Japan is showing a high-rank autocorrelation coefﬁcient at the two-digit level and a much lowercoefﬁcient at the four-digit level. In the former case, the high persistence in rank indicates thatchanges occurred within product groups and in a fairly ordered way (with reference to Figure 2, theproduct specialisation is changing but the order of relevance of the sectors remains relativelyunchanged).ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1695© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005of the NICs, at a two-digit level. With the exceptions of Romania and the US,17the coefﬁcient shrinks along time. Things are different at the four-digit level:both the degree of similarity with the NICs and of dissimilarity with the OECDcountries is reduced, indicating an imperfect overlap in product specialisation.The evidence that Italy is deﬁnitely competing with the NICs on the sameproduct segments is therefore mixed, at the aggregate level, and the changes inthe rank correlation coefﬁcients indicate that vertical differentiation is takingplace in traditional sectors. Italy is therefore not so similar to the NICs, as onewould expect. Hence, this imperfect overlap in product specialisation couldexplain the ability of small Italian ﬁrms to still compete with ﬁrms located inlabour-abundant countries.4. REGIONAL RCAThe analysis on the structure and the dynamics of RCA can be extended froma national to a regional level. In spite of the contribution of Bertil Ohlin, until17 The tendencies have to do with the characteristics of the catching-up process with the techno-logical leadership of the US and with the increased OPT ﬂows between Italy and Romania thatchanged noteworthy the product specialisation of Romania after 1989.TABLE 2Our Elaborations on UN-World Bank TradeCAN Database, 2003Country Year Rank Correlation with Italy Rank AutocorrelationTwo Digits Four Digits Two Digits Four Digits(35 sectors) (530 sectors) (35 sectors) (530 sectors)Japan 1986 −0.24 0.00 0.96 0.781998 −0.16 0.00USA 1986 −0.53 −0.20 0.90 0.791998 −0.60 −0.15UK 1986 −0.13 −0.02 0.66 0.721998 −0.04 −0.18Taiwan 1986 0.62 0.32 0.67 0.751998 0.48 0.27Thailand 1986 0.57 0.23 0.76 0.671998 0.46 0.19Romania 1986 0.28 0.22 0.83 0.681998 0.34 0.20Italy 1986 1.00 1.00 0.91 0.801998 1.00 1.00Note:The table is a partial modiﬁcation of Tables 3 and 4 in De Benedictis and Tamberi (2000).1696 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005recently trade economists generally considered the national product specialisationas if the country – a country whatsoever – would have been a homogeneouseconomic entity. Often that is not the case, and as it is argued by the so-calledNew Economic Geography, the occurrence of trade ﬂows and the changesin comparative advantages can be hardly understood without a theory of thelocation of economic activities in a dishomogeneous spatial dimension. Asfor Italy, this is certainly the case. Economic disparity among Italian regionsis a well-known fact (Graziani, 1989; and Rossi and Toniolo, 1996). A lessstudied implication of that very disparity is whether it has had any impact onthe dynamics of RCA at the national level. Is the Italian pattern of RCAdominated by the inﬂuence exerted by the changes in RCA which occurred ina particular geographic area? In order to address this question we have to con-sider export ﬂows and RCA indices at a disaggregation; data is chosen at theprovincial level.Let us deﬁne the sectoral export share of each province relative to the worldsectoral export share as: Θijp ijp wjip wX XX X //,=where the subscript p stands for ‘province’. On the other hand, the sectoral exportshare of each province relative to the national sectoral export share is: θijp ijp ijip iX XX X //.=We can now redeﬁne, omitting subscripts, the RCA index described in equa-tion (2) as:Θ ≡ θ · b ≡ θ · c · d, (4)showing that the sectoral RCA of each province (Θ) is positively related tothe national RCA index (b) and to the sectoral export share of each provinceand negatively related to the national sectoral export share (inversely relatedto θ).From the identity 4 we can also derive the following expression: bXXpipi ,≡ ⋅∑Θ (5)which indicates that the national sectoral RCA index is the weighted sum of thesectoral RCA of each province. Since the distribution of Θ is even more skewedITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1697© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005FIGURE 5The Italian Regional Anomalythan the distribution of b we opted again for a bounded version of the index,transforming Θ in ΘB = ( ) ΘΘ−+11, and Italian export data was applied at the provin-cial level collected by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT, 2002) between1991 and 2001. (See the Appendix for a detailed description of the data set.)a. Regional RCA DensitiesThe issue of national RCA being determined by speciﬁc regional overallspecialisation is explored with the help of kernel densities, comparing thenational estimated density function with the density functions of Italian regions,aggregated in four different macro-areas.1698 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005The four macro-areas considered consist of provinces in the North-West, theNorth-East, the Centre, and the Mezzogiorno of Italy.18 In each panel of Figure 5the estimated distribution of the ΘB values was plotted for each macro-area in1991, the dotted line, and 2001, the continuous line, together with the estimateddistribution of the bB values for Italy in 1991, the shaded area common to the fourpanels.We can compare national and regional values in 1991, just to give evidence ofthe differences in overall specialisation, and also changes in regional densitiesalong time can also be observed, as we did for national RCA in Figure 4. In allfour cases regional distributions are different from the national one in somerespects. (In all cases the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test did not acceptthe null hypothesis of the two distributions being drawn from the same continuousdistribution.) The North-Western provinces are characterised by a more con-centrated distribution (both in 1991 and in 2001), with an evident bimodality.From 1991 to 2001 the number of sectors with a positive ΘB has increased, andthe principal mode has moved from negative to positive. In North-Eastern andCentre provinces the shape of the density function did not change much, but thesecondary mode had a rise in relevance. In the Mezzogiorno extreme ΘB valuesconverged towards the mode or diverged, moving towards the edges of the dis-tribution, generating a noteworthy bilateral step in the density function. In allmacro-areas the median of the ΘB values moved to the right from 1991 to 2001.In summary, all macro-areas contributed to the switch to the right of thenational density function observed in Figure 4, but the relative contributionof each area is quite different. The major changes are the ones observed in theNorth-Western provinces, where the principal mode is now substantially positive,and in the Mezzogiorno. The degree of persistence is also very different acrossmacro-areas. Can this be related to the organisational structure of ﬁrms in thedifferent provinces? Have industrial districts anything to do with the persistenceof Italian RCA?b. Industrial Districts and PersistenceIn the ﬁrst section of the paper we founded the explanation of the actualstructure of Italian comparative advantages on the existence of learning-by-doingexternalities associated with the presence of industrial districts. An empiricalvalidation of that presumption is now sought. A direct test is, however, difﬁcultto put forward, so an indirect test was chosen, asking if sectors and provinces18 The regions belonging to the four macro-areas are the following: Valle d’Aosta, PiemonteLombardia and Liguria in the North-West; Veneto, Trentino Alto-Adige, Friuli Venezia-Giulia andEmilia Romagna in the North-East; Toscana, Marche, Umbria and Lazio in the Centre; and Abruzzo,Molise, Puglia, Campania, Basilicata, Calabria, Sicilia and Sardegna in the Mezzogiorno.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1699© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005characterised by the presence of industrial districts have a signiﬁcative effecton the persistence of Italian RCA.Theory does not offer a clear-cut prediction. On the one hand, the clusteringof ﬁrms, allowing growth in productivity through a cooperative network ofinformation-sharing and co-participation to innovation, promotes horizontaland vertical differentiation, granting ﬁrms producing labour-intensive goods tointernationally compete with productions coming from labour-abundant NICs.The prevalence of cooperation over competition among ﬁrms in the cluster alsoallows follower ﬁrms to rapidly adapt to successful strategies adopted by theleading ﬁrm in the sector. Within-product ﬂexibility and the ability to rapidlyadapt to changes should therefore be enhanced in clustered ﬁrms. On the otherhand, ﬁrms clustered in a district may be less sensible to market signals whenlock-in phenomena are more pronounced; that would inhibit the propensity tochange sectoral product specialisation, favouring RCA’s persistence. The ques-tion should therefore be addressed empirically.Fortunately, the long and fruitful tradition of studies on the role of theindustrial districts in shaping the structure of the Italian economy19 has recentlybeen enriched by the collection and elaboration of data by the ItalianNational Statistical Institute (ISTAT, 1997). We will make use of this data,20jointly examining the export structure of the 104 Italian provinces and the pres-ence of industrial districts in each province.Unfortunately, the time span covered by the data only covers ten years, from1991 to 2001, while the sectoral aggregation allows us to consider 35 manufacturingsectors of the SITC (rev. 2) classiﬁcation (ISTAT, 2002). The data on industrialdistricts (ISTAT, 1997) identiﬁes 616 local labour systems, that, excluding thefood districts, reduces to 259 districts specialised in the production and exportof Paper, Chemicals, Machinery, Miscellaneous Manufactured Articles (Toys,Musical Instruments and Jewellery), Leather and Footwear, Furniture, Non-metallic Mineral Manufactures, Textiles, and Apparel and Clothing. Noteworthy,in some sectors where the scale of production is a relevant factor, the presenceof industrial districts is null or very limited (Chemicals, Iron and Steel, RoadVehicles); the majority of the districts are concentrated in the traditional sectors(Leather, Textiles, Furniture, Apparel and Clothing, Footwear, MiscellaneousManufactured Articles) and in sectors producing machineries (Power GeneratingMachinery, Specialised Machinery, Metal Working Machinery) and is localisedin the North-East and Central Italian provinces; the number of districts in the19 See Becattini (1999) for a recent summing up and Signorini (2000) for a quantiﬁcation of thedistrict effect in ﬁrm’s efﬁciency.20 We use the ISTAT (1997) classiﬁcation since it is the most widely used. Many other classiﬁcationsare, however, available (IPI, 2002). Every classiﬁcation is prone to criticism and each classiﬁcationtends to over- or under-estimate the phenomenon.1700 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005Mezzogiorno is very limited. In our analysis we used a modiﬁed version of theISTAT classiﬁcation deﬁned by Lucia Piscitello that allows us to consider notonly the main sector of specialisation of the district but also the eventual secondmain sector. The resulting total number of sectoral districts amounts to 313.Several characteristics of the data on RCA in the Italian provinces must betaken into account: (a) ΘB is a bounded index, a large number of observationshave a ΘB ≈ −1 (almost 30 per cent of the observations have values lower than−0.9), more than eight per cent of the observations have high ΘB values (greaterthan 0.5); (b) the ISTAT-Piscitello classiﬁcation allows us to construct a dichoto-mous variable associated with the presence or absence of industrial districts in asector of a certain province, but does not allow to quantitatively differentiate(small vs big; mono-product vs multi-product; old vs new, homogeneous struc-ture of ﬁrms vs pyramidal structure) one district from the other; (c) the number ofprovinces changed from 1991 to 2001; eight new provinces were instituted after1995: this inﬂates the number of ΘB = −1 in the ﬁrst years considered.21Figure 6 describes the scatter plots of nine over the 35 sectors included inthe original data set. Having the 1991 ΘB values on the horizontal axis and the2001 ΘB values on the vertical axis, the spots identify the sectoral RCA of the104 Italian provinces: the darker spots correspond to the provinces characterisedby the presence of industrial districts, the empty spots to the provinces charac-terised by the absence of industrial districts, and the shaded square identiﬁesthe bB value for Italy, derived in expression (5). We also plotted in all panels a45° dotted line and the continuous OLS regression line.Two things are worth noting: the remarkable presence of industrial districtsin sectors of national comparative advantages, and the higher degree of persist-ence (lower dispersion around the 45° line) in sectors characterised by bothpositive or negative bB and by the presence or the absence of industrial districts.Persistence seems to be a prevalent feature in the subsample of sectors high-lighted in Figure 6.We will further explore the issue through the following Galtonian regression:22 Θ Θ ΘjpB jpB jp jpB jp jpd d u2001 1 1991 2 1991 ,= + ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ +α β β γ (6)where djp is a dichotomous variable that assumes value one if the sector jin province p is characterised by an industrial district, and zero otherwise, theinteraction term permits different slopes for different levels of the factor djp, and21 This can be seen in Figure 6 where eight observations are systematically drawn in proximity tothe vertical axis.22 A similar approach has been used in the analysis of RCA by Crafts and Thomas (1986), Amendola,Guerrieri and Padoan (1992) and Laursen (2002).ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1701© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005FIGURE 6A Selection of Sectors – Italian Provinces (1991–2001).Note:Dark spots identify provinces characterised by the presence of industrial districts (according to the ISTAT-Piscitello classiﬁcation); the shaded square identiﬁes the bB value for Italy.Data Source: ISTAT (1997 and 2002).ujp is an error term. Those provinces that did not exist in 1991 were excludedfrom the data.Regression results are summarised in Table 3. In all regressions presented, thecoefﬁcients of particular interest are 51 and 6.The 51 coefﬁcient in regression (1) in Table 3 indicates a degree of persistencenot far from the one visualised in Figure 3. The regression is a pooled version of1702 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005the separate regressions shown in Figure 6, the 51 coefﬁcient is high, positive andsigniﬁcant: a change of one unit in ΘB1991 will tend to increase ΘB2001 by 0.81. Inregression (2) we controlled for sectoral and regional heterogeneity in dataadding sectoral and macro-regional dummies to the regression. The coefﬁcient51 is not much reduced, indicating that only a minimal part of persistence is dueto compositional effects attributed to sectoral characteristics or to the speciﬁcgeographic location of ﬁrms. The ﬁt of the regression improves and the F-testindicates that the dummy variables are statistically signiﬁcant. In regression (3)the district dummy variable was included in a way that allowed for differentintercepts in the regression line. If we compare two provinces having the samevalue of ΘBjp in 1991 the estimated value ΘBip in 2001 will always be 0.164 higherfor the province characterised by a district in the j-sector: industrial districtsenhance Italian RCA. In regression (3) an interaction term was also added, whosecoefﬁcient 6 catches the effect of districts on persistence. The estimated coefﬁ-cient is positive and signiﬁcant indicating that persistence is higher for provinceswith sectors where ﬁrms clustering is present: the regression line for suchprovinces is 0.284 + 0.846 · ΘBjp; while in the case of no districts the regressionline is 0.120 + 0.713 · ΘBjp. Finally, in regression (4) we only considered provincialsectors exporting abroad, so to focus on ΘBjp > −1. The results are not muchdifferent: the level of persistence is a little bit higher, 51 = 0.729 and the effectof districts on the intercept and the slope of the regression is reduced. The mainmessage remains the same, however: in the time span considered the presence ofindustrial districts is positively related to the persistence of RCA in Italy.TABLE 3Galtonian Regressions: The Dependent Variable is ΘB2001 (1) (2) (3) (4)Intercept −0.061*** 0.111* 0.120* 0.114*(0.007) (0.066) (0.066) (0.065)ΘB1991 0.810*** 0.752*** 0.713*** 0.729***(0.011) (0.013) (0.013) (0.014)district 0.164*** 0.161***(0.024) (0.024)ΘB1991*district 0.133** 0.121**(0.043) (0.042)Macro-regional dummy No Yes Yes YesSectoral dummy No Yes Yes YesObservations 3,359 3,359 3,359 3,196 (no zeros)σu 0.349 0.338 0.335 0.335R2adj 0.614 0.636 0.638 0.641F 5,347*** 151.5*** 149.1*** 140.4***Notes:Standard errors in parentheses.Signiﬁcant tails: 0.000: ‘***’; 0.001: ‘**’; 0.01: ‘*’.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1703© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 20055. CONCLUSIONSItaly is a trade puzzle: an industrialised country with a highly persistentspecialisation in labour-intensive traditional goods is an anomaly in the worldtrading system. In this paper we have explored the structure of Italian exports,making use of the Balassa index of revealed comparative advantage (RCA),focusing on the export structure itself, on its change over time and on its degreeof persistence. The analysis has been developed through non-parametric statisti-cal techniques that allow us to estimate the empirical distribution of the Balassaindex and to track its dynamic change during three decades, from the 1970s tothe present. As theory suggested, we relate this change to the role of industrialdistricts, in order to show how the organisation of ﬁrms in the local structure ofproduction promotes or bounds it.In spite of the high persistence in the structure of RCA, several changes haverecently occurred. We have given evidence to some of them: (a) the Italian struc-ture of comparative advantages is not only characterised by ‘traditional sectors’and the relevance of ‘machineries’ is substantially increasing; (b) on the otherhand, the intensity of the bB values associated to ‘traditional sectors’ still remainsvery high compared to other OECD countries, so that the distribution of the bB’sis still more right-skewed than other industrialised countries; (c) a conspicuousnumber of sectors comparatively disadvantaged in 1985 are now becoming morecomparatively advantaged; (d) the overall specialisation is moving to the right,the bimodality of the 1980s has been inverted in the 1990s, the main mode of thedistribution is unique and is above 1, and almost 50 per cent of the manufacturingsectors are now comparative advantaged; (e) those national changes are mainlygenerated by the changes occurring in the distribution of RCA in provinceslocated in the North-West, where the production of machineries is located, andin the Mezzogiorno, highly specialised in traditional sectors; (f) the presence ofindustrial districts is positively related to the degree of persistence of RCA.After 30 years the Italian anomaly is still there. We will see in the nextdecades if the signs of change that we are now depicting are just a temporaryturbulence or instead are the indicators of a more radical turn in the Italianpattern of comparative advantages.APPENDIXData DescriptionThe empirical strategy followed in this paper has been largely dependent ondata availability. Since the ideal data set consisting of a panel of highly spatiallyand sectorally disaggregated data is unavailable, we have been therefore moving1704 LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005from one data set to the other when a speciﬁc question required the use of aspeciﬁc level of data disaggregation.More precisely, the new OECD Stan database (OECD, 2002) has been usedwhen an international comparison was required and the sectoral disaggregationshould be around 20–30 sectors in order to make the visual representationmeaningful; the World Bank TradeCAN database has been used (UN-WorldBank, 1999) when we required a higher level of sectoral disaggregation; andﬁnally the Italian ISTAT data set (ISTAT, 2002) was used when a higher level ofspatial disaggregation was required.More detailed explanations on the data used are given below.The STAN database. The data (used in Figure 2) is collected by the OECD(2002), at the two-digit level of the SITC (rev. 2) classiﬁcation. It covers around75 per cent of world trade.The sectors considered in the two-digit OECD (2002) data set are: Food,Beverages, Tobacco, Textiles, Wearing Apparel, Leather & Products, Footwear,Wood Products, Furniture & Fixtures, Paper & Products, Printing & Publish-ing, Industrial Chemicals, Other Chemicals, Petroleum Reﬁneries & Products,Rubber Products, Plastic Products (n.e.c.), Pottery & China, Glass, Non-metallicProducts (n.e.c.), Iron & Steel, Non-ferrous Metals, Metal Products, Non-electrical Machinery, Electrical Machinery, Transport Equipment, ProfessionalGoods, and Other Manufacturing.Deriving b we have used the total (and sectoral) export of OECD countriesas w variable(s); which – according to OECD (2002) – corresponds to more than70 per cent of total world exports.The UN-World Bank database. The UN-World Bank (2000) TradeCAN datacome from the COMTRADE database, the ofﬁcial trade database of the UnitedNations Statistical Ofﬁce. The time series starts in 1985 in some countries and in1986 in others, and ends at 1998. There are 82 reporting countries and 193countries of origin. According to the collectors, ‘Trade-CAN incorporates wellover 90 per cent of world trade’.TradeCAN uses the SITC (revision 2) classiﬁcation, at two-, three- and four-digit levels of disaggregation. We used the two-digit level in Table 2 (63 groups),and the four-digit level in Figures 3 and 4, and in Table 2 as well (786 sub-groups). We only used data on manufacturing sectors (540 at the four-digit level)including sectors with SITC code from 5 to 9. Food sectors (codes 0, 1, 2 and 4)were not included because of the difﬁculties in separating raw material frommanufactures. Ten manufacturing sectors were excluded from the analysis sincethere was no data available for 1998. The total number of yearly observations inour analysis amounts to 530.The ISTAT database. The ISTAT (2002) database collects data on Italianexports at the provincial level. The data includes all 104 Italian provinces, andthe time span is ten years, from 1991 and 2001.ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1705© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005The 35 sectors considered in the analysis are: Organic Chemicals; InorganicChemicals; Dyeing and Tanning; Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Products; Essen-tial Oils for Perfume; Fertilisers; Plastics in Primary Forms; Plastics in Non-primary Forms; Other Chemical Materials; Leather; Rubber Manufactures; Wood(excluding furniture); Paper; Textile; Non-metallic Mineral Manufactures; Ironand Steel; Non-ferrous Metals; Manufactures of Metal; Power GeneratingMachinery; Specialised Machinery; Metal Working Machinery; Other IndustrialMachinery and Parts; Ofﬁce Machines; Telecommunication and Sound RecordingApparatus; Electrical Machinery; Road Vehicles; Other Transport Equipment;Prefabricated Buildings and Sanitary; Furniture; Travel Goods and Handbags;Apparel and Clothing; Footwear; Professional and Scientiﬁc Instruments; Photo-optical Goods and Watches; Miscellaneous Manufactured Articles.b-Values: 1970 and 1998The numerical values of the b’s for Italy, Spain, Japan, Germany, US and theUK derived from the OECD (2002) database for 1970 and 1998 are included inTable A1.Some information can be extracted from simple manipulation of the data con-tained in Table A1. Using the b’s in a cardinal way allows the possibility ofdemarcation and of sectoral and country ranking. In 1970, the share of Italianexports in the textiles sector was proportional to the world share to an order ofmagnitude of 1.42; and in 1970 the share of the Italian textiles sector with respectto the Italian professional goods sector (the relative contribution to total export)was (1.42)(0.59) = 0.84 times greater than for the sum of the countries consideredin the sample set; and, ﬁnally, that in 1970 the share of the Italian textiles sectorwas (1.42)(0.91) = 1.29 times greater than the same share for Germany.Estimating Kernel DensitiesThe easier way of describing kernel densities is to relate them to histograms.As in Bowman and Azzalini (1997) the histogram may be written as: f b( ) ( ; )b I b hBjnBjB= −=∑1,where bBj is the data (with j = 1, . . . , n); bBj is the centre of the interval in which bBjfalls, and I(bB − bBj; h) is the indicator function of the interval [−h, h].The Kernel estimator has the form: e ( ) ( ; )bnw b hBjnBjB= −=∑11∫ ,1706LUCA DE BENEDICTIS© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005TABLE A1Our Elaborations on OECD (2002): b – 1970, 1998Code Sector Italy Japan USA UK Spain Germany1970 1998 1970 1998 1970 1998 1970 1998 1970 1998 1970 19980 Food 0.49 0.76 0.41 0.07 1.03 0.93 0.39 0.68 3.04 1.41 0.37 0.730 Beverages 1.20 1.25 0.03 0.04 0.08 0.40 2.94 2.02 3.86 1.68 0.25 0.450 Tobacco 0.02 0.15 0.00 0.14 2.28 2.67 2.11 0.80 0.65 0.24 0.33 0.711 Textiles 1.42 2.29 1.79 0.49 0.35 0.73 1.13 1.01 0.84 1.04 0.91 0.881 Wearing Apparel 3.38 3.14 1.23 0.06 0.29 0.68 0.82 1.03 1.32 0.76 0.67 0.851 Leather Products 2.16 4.88 0.69 0.12 0.44 0.47 1.44 0.76 2.90 2.17 0.94 0.591 Footwear 7.41 5.53 0.37 0.02 0.06 0.23 0.66 0.61 8.38 3.54 0.40 0.440 Wood Products 0.54 0.46 0.59 0.03 0.70 0.85 0.13 0.14 1.59 0.59 0.33 0.421 Furniture, Fixtures 1.81 3.44 0.34 0.08 0.30 0.54 0.65 0.52 1.85 1.24 1.50 0.830 Paper Products 0.27 0.57 0.22 0.17 0.92 0.95 0.33 0.54 0.29 0.70 0.32 0.880 Printing, Publishing 1.13 0.94 0.51 0.16 1.20 1.26 1.54 1.97 3.95 1.30 0.93 1.072 Industrial Chemicals 0.74 0.65 0.89 0.80 1.20 1.12 0.89 1.06 0.72 0.76 1.27 1.232 Other Chemicals 0.78 0.73 0.34 0.64 1.15 0.94 1.52 1.53 0.60 0.70 1.17 1.082 Petroleum, Reﬁneries, Products 2.23 0.70 0.12 0.29 0.76 0.78 1.06 1.06 2.35 1.41 0.86 0.480 Rubber Products 1.30 0.97 1.29 1.20 0.59 0.69 1.33 0.96 2.38 1.89 0.87 1.100 Plastic Products, n.e.c. 2.10 1.67 1.90 0.28 0.62 0.87 0.75 0.90 0.67 1.03 1.03 1.111 Pottery, China etc. 1.36 1.58 2.95 1.51 0.12 0.44 1.70 1.69 0.98 1.31 1.41 0.951 Glass Products 1.25 1.13 0.61 0.85 0.80 0.82 0.84 0.61 0.74 1.15 1.07 1.001 Non-metallic Products, n.e.c. 2.23 3.28 0.71 0.55 0.61 0.36 0.98 0.70 1.34 3.46 1.14 0.800 Iron Steel 0.49 1.05 2.01 1.24 0.50 0.33 0.64 0.89 0.38 1.31 1.04 1.080 Non-ferrous Metals 0.30 0.53 0.34 0.49 0.73 0.74 1.23 0.91 0.76 0.95 0.58 0.910 Metal Products 1.16 1.70 1.08 0.71 0.78 0.85 1.22 0.82 1.23 1.09 1.33 1.222 Non-electrical Machinery 1.32 1.16 0.61 1.34 1.44 1.21 1.17 1.10 0.57 0.49 1.36 1.092 Electrical Machinery 0.83 0.63 1.89 1.75 1.01 1.21 0.91 1.04 0.50 0.60 1.09 0.912 Transport Equipment 0.68 0.58 1.07 1.24 1.26 0.98 1.02 0.86 0.65 1.61 1.03 1.142 Professional Goods 0.59 0.57 1.38 1.65 1.48 1.37 1.13 1.11 0.23 0.35 1.32 1.030 Other Manufacturing 1.39 1.79 1.47 0.72 0.72 0.68 2.13 1.89 0.62 0.56 0.80 0.54ITALIAN COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES 1707© Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005where w is a symmetric probability function with zero mean called the kernelfunction. The kernel function can take various forms; if a normal density functionis chosen, then h – which is called the smoothing parameter – is the standarddeviation of the function.The function w has generally little effect on the shape of the distribution, whileh is crucial in determining the smoothness of the estimate. In the analysis weused a Gaussian kernel and an optimal h (Bowman and Azzalini, 1997).REFERENCESAmendola, G., P. Guerrieri and P. C.
