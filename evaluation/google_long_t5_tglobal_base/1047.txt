ABSTRACT: 
In February 1944, Missak Manouchian and twenty-one of his fellow Resistance fighters were executed by the Nazis. Over sixty years later, a prize-winning French author, Didier Daeninckx, is regularly depicting key members of this band of warriors in his novels, short stories, childrenâ€™s books and other writings, thereby finding himself at the forefront of a veritable wave of imaginative representations and commemorations of these martyrs for the cause of freedom. After exploring this individual obsession of Daeninckxâ€™s and its relationship to the broader retrospective trend, this article ultimately contends that not only the authorâ€™s subject matter, but also many of his narrative strategies suggest that France has still not really managed to come to terms with the legacy of the Occupation.

Following a series of highly visible attacks in Paris, committed by the CommunistÂµLPPLJUDQWÂ¶ Resistance group of Missak Manouchian,2 the Brigades spÃ©ciales (special Brigades) of the French police finally pounce on the perpetrators, and arrest follows arrest. At the end of a very brief trial a few months later, twenty-three members of the combat unit, including Manouchian himself, are condemned to death. The twenty-two men are immediately shot at Mont ValÃ©rien, on 21 February 1944 (the one woman, Olga Bancic, is executed separately, beheaded in Stuttgart on 10 May). More or less simultaneously, the photos of ten of these freedom fighters are displayed on the infamous Affiches rouges (red posters), which are plastered over the walls of French towns and cities, and which denounce ÂµOÂ¶$UPpHGXFULPHÂ¶WKH$UP\RIFULPHmost obviously composed of people with names of foreign, if not Jewish, origin. Shortly afterwards, the Liberation of France, for which these combatants willingly gave their lives, commenced. That is by no means the end of their story, however. Throughout the post-war period, WKHJURXSUHJXODUO\FRPHVEDFNLQWRWKHKHDGOLQHVIRUPLQJDV0DUJDUHW$WDFNKDVQRWHGÂµDQ LPSRUWDQWIRFDOSRLQWIRUUHPHPEUDQFHDQGFRQWURYHUV\Â¶ (2013: 175).3 For example, in 1955, in honour of the group, and to mark the inauguration of a rue du Groupe Manouchian in Paris, Louis Aragon writes the poem which will first appear in /Â¶+XPDQLWp on 5 March 1955, HQWLWOHGÂµ*URXSH0DQRXFKDLQÂ¶DQGWKHQin his collection, Le Roman inachevÃ©, as Âµ6WURSKHV SRXUVHVRXYHQLUÂ¶ (1956: 225-26).

Another important development occurs in the 1980s, when a Âµ0DQRXFKLDQ$IIDLUÂ¶EORZVXS, centred on allegations that the unit was deliberately sacrificed, and the ensuing debate runs and runs (Courtois, 1985; Kidd & Blyth, 2000; Atack, 2013: 176-77). The 1980s also see the first of a number of books memorializing his former colleagues by one of the surviving members of the unit, ArsÃ¨ne Tchakarian (1986, 1991, 2012). Yet of all the writers and creative talents who IRFXVRQWKLVÂµ$UP\RIFULPHÂ¶, one particular figure currently stands out in France. The figure in question is Didier Daeninckx. A prize-winning novelist and short-story-teller who now regularly publishes in mainstream collections, Daeninckx initially made his name in the noir genre, which provided him with the perfect outlet for his own version of the anti-establishment views that had run in his family for generations: his father and paternal grandfather were both anarchists, the latter having been punished for desertion in 1917, while his mother was a member of the PCF (French Communist Party), as was her father, the communist mayor of one of the Paris suburbs in the 1930s. Daeninckx similarly began his political life in the Party, but left in 1982, following a disagreement Â² an early example of his irrevocably contestatory spirit (Daeninckx, 1997: 8-9, 104-05, 117-19; Maricourt, 2009: 18-24, 262-63). This all-embracing, politicized non-conformism continues to energize 'DHQLQFN[Â¶V writing todayDQGKLVÂ°XYUHLVreplete ZLWKÂµUHEHOOLRXVFKDUDFWHUV>Â«@FKDUDFWHUVZKRVKRZ WKDWLWLVSRVVLEOHIRUWKLQJVWRFKDQJHÂ¶0DULFRurt, 2009: 218). It therefore comes as no surprise to discover that, time and again in recent years, the author has turned his gaze back to the Manouchian resistance group, and depicted it Â² to a greater or lesser degree Â² in a wide variety of his texts. It is the threefold aim of the present article to examine this apparent compulsion RI'DHQLQFN[Â¶VWRVLWXDWHLWLQLWVEURDGHUFRQWH[WDQGto suggest what it may reveal about the status of the Occupation in France today. 3 'DHQLQFN[Â¶V interest in the so-FDOOHGÂµAUP\RIFULPHÂ¶first materializes in 2004, although its focus is not the obvious one. Rather than the leader, the centre of attention is another member of the group, Rino Della Negra. Daeninckx makes this footballer-for-Red Star-cum-doomed-Resister the subject of a brief biographical piece Â² later reproduced in La MÃ©moire longue (Daeninckx, 2008) Â² as well as the hero of Viva la libertÃ©, the third of his 7URLVVHFUHWVGÂ¶$OH[DQGUD, a collection of illustrated FKLOGUHQÂ¶VERRNVDOO of which centre on the Occupation (2003a, 2003b, 2004).4 The following year, Della Negra reappears in Âµ5XEULTXH6SRUWVÂ¶RQHRIWKHVKRUWVWRULHVLQCitÃ©s perdues, and then in 2006, he resurfaces again, this time with his comrades-in-arms, in ItinÃ©raire GÂ¶XQVDODXGRUGLQDLUH. Spanning the period from 1942 to 1981, but devoting about half of its pages to the Occupation and its immediate aftermath, this lengthy (for Daeninckx) novel follows the salaud ordinaire (ordinary bastard) of the title as he moves up the ranks, progressing from his early subordinate role in the wartime Special Brigades to his more active participation in many of )UDQFHÂ¶VSRVW-war causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres prior to 1981.5 AOWKRXJKWKH0DQRXFKLDQJURXSÂ¶V appearance here is limited, the text is an important part of the overall story, as it deals at some length with the policemen who effected the arrests, giving readers an excellent insight into the outlook and practices of these detectives. The significance of this focus becomes clear in 2009, when Missak appears. In this novel set in the winter of 1954-55, Louis DragÃ¨re, a young journalist at /Â¶+XPDQLWp and a committed member of the PCF, is asked to conduct a review of the Manouchian group, so that the party will know if there are any skeletons in the cupboard of this now-lauded team of men and women (the man who explains the task is the suggestively named Vieuguet - Old lookout). In time-honoured detective fashion (despite the fact that the book is not marketed as belonging to this genre), Louis embarks on an investigation, by the end of which a detailed portrayal of Manouchian, the Armenian poet who ended up dying for France, has emerged. 4 Given its subject matter, then, Missak can be seen as the perfect complement to ItinÃ©raire GÂ¶XQVDODXGRUGLQDLUH. Its concentration on the eponymous Resistance leader combines with WKHHDUOLHUZRUNÂ¶VGHSLFWLRQRIhis enemies to form a far more complete and balanced picture. What is more, as Daeninckx himself has admitted, nothing could better RIIVHWÂµWKHLWLQHUDU\RI an ordinary salaudÂ¶WKDQÂµWKDWRIDQH[HPSODU\KHURÂ¶ (Rubino, 2009: 178).6 Still in 2009, Daeninckx publishes a second version of the Manouchian narrative, 0LVVDNOÂ¶HQIDQWGHOÂ¶$IILFKHURXJH, a text which, like Viva la libertÃ©, is illustrated and aimed at young children. In 2010, a third variation on the theme appears, this time for slightly older children. Entitled Avec le groupe Manouchian, it once again has Rino Della Negra amongst its cast list. )LQDOO\LQ'DHQLQFN[Â¶V*oncourt-Prize-winning collection of short stories, /Â¶(VSRLUHQFRQWUHEDQGH, includes two further references to members of the group: the XELTXLWRXV'HOOD1HJUDIHDWXUHVEULHIO\LQÂµ)RXVGX)RRWÂ¶, while Manouchian plays a more fundamental UROHLQÂµ3DJHGHJDUGHÂ¶. All of this evidence ably demonstrates that, since the start of the new millennium, Daeninckx has been obsessed by the Manouchian group, but what might his motivation be? Apart from the range of narrative possibilities that the combat unit offers to an established writer of noir fiction, there are a whole host of other answers to this question, one notable one being the need to provide a personal commemoration in print, to honour the commitment, rebellion and ultimate self-sacrifice of these brave freedom fighters. This tribute can be seen in many ways. Firstly, the titles of the key works, which convey a positive intimacy with the leader of the gang (he is affectionately called Missak) or a bond of solidarity with all of its members (Avec le groupe Manouchian). Secondly, the listing of the names and last words of those involved, as is best seen in Avec le groupe Manouchian (2010: 93-94, 100-101), where the now grown-up narrator takes part in television and radio debates, explicitly explaining, in ZRUGVUHPLQLVFHQWRIWKRVHRIWKHÂµ)DWKHURI+LVWRU\Â¶+HURGRWXVÂµ,UHPHPEHUWKHLUQDPHV 5 >Â«@E\VSHDNLQJ,Vave them from oblivion at leastÂ¶ (2010: 99).7 Finally, there is perhaps a more subtle accolade being offered by Daeninckx, and this to Manouchian in particular. Speaking of 0LVVDNRXOÂ¶HQIDQWGHOÂ¶$IILFKHURXJH, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Le Bon has observed: Âµ+LVWRU\LV rewritten as a poem, in homage to the poet that Missak MaQRXFKLDQZDVZKHQKHZDVDOLYHÂ¶ (Le Bon, 2010: 213). The same ÂµSRHWLFÂ¶TXDOLW\LVDIHDWXUHof DOORI'DHQLQFN[Â¶VILFWLRQVRQ this subject, with Missak being a conspicuous example. The start of this novel sees Louis and his photographer travel to meet a gang of local \RXWKVWKH)DXFKÂ¶PDQ, so called because of their lack of money (fauchÃ© ÂµEURNHÂ¶, on whom he is to write an article. The encounter is eloquent. Margaret Atack has rightly highlighted the ZD\LQZKLFKÂµDQREYLRXVSDUDOOHOLVGUDZQZLWKWKHIRUHLJQUHVLVWHUVÂ¶, thanks to their camaraderie, their nicknames, their marginality, and the fact that their photos will soon be displayed for all to see (Atack, 2013: 179), but the resonance does not end there. The access WRWKHWHHQDJHUVÂ¶GHQLVYLDD sort of small, concealed basement window, and once Louis is inside, an electricity cut makes the scene look like ÂµDPHHWLQJRIFRQVSLUDWRUVÂ¶ (Daeninckx, 2009a: 17). Here, too, the opening serves as a metaphorical introduction to the narrative to come, for DragÃ¨re will soon be asked to go on another journey, down into a more or less hidden past, to investigate and write about another group of young conspirators working in the shadows (those of WKHÂµGDUN\HDUVÂ¶RI-44).

The figure obviously comes to represent him: naive and SROLWLFDOO\ÂµUHGÂ¶, he too has his (ideological) innocence WKUHDWHQHGE\WKHÂµZROIÂ¶ he encounters, learning that RQHRI0DQRXFKLDQÂ¶VFRPUDGHV-in-arms 6 seems to have been ÂµD7URWVN\LWHPROHZKRKDGLQILOWUDWHGWKHPRVWSUHVWLJLRXVJURXSRI &RPPXQLVWILJKWHUVÂ¶(2009a: 130). In addition to such metaphors, Missak is characterized by a network of echoes and leitmotifs. /RXLVÂ¶VLVQRWWKHILUVWLQWHUQDOLQYHVWLJDWLRQRILWVNLQd (2009a: 241, 254); information is frequently repeated, as interviewees say the same things and Louis writes down, and then transcribes, what he has heard; and there are two betrayals of the group, which are in turn mirrored by the situation of all those members whom the Communist Party has recently denounced and punished as traitors, the Resistance hero, Charles Tillon, included (2009a: 123, 171-72, 173, 190-91. Cf. Daeninckx, 1997: 109). An important variation on this strategy of repetition is the use of mises en abyme. For instance, reflections of Manouchian are seen both in the artist BediguLDQÂ¶VSRUWUDLWRIKLP (2009a: 89- 90),8 DQGLQWKHTXRWDWLRQVIURP9LFWRU+XJRÂ¶VSRHPÂµ/Â¶(QIDQWÂ¶ (2009a: 148-50), which GHSLFWVD\RXQJ*UHHNER\ÂµDEDQGRning all the beauties of the world for gunpowder and bulletsÂ¶ (2009a: 150 Â± 'DHQLQFN[Â¶VLWDOLFV7here are also oft-repeated commemorations within 'DHQLQFN[Â¶Vown literary commemoration, most notably the references to the forthcoming inauguration of the rue du Groupe Manouchian in Paris and to $UDJRQÂ¶V aforementioned memorial poem, written to mark the event.9 All of these various homages come together in a crescendo at the end of the novel, after Louis submits his positive report. The new street is inaugurated$UDJRQÂ¶VSRHP appears; the key figures whom Louis has interviewed are present; and the assignment on the )DXFKÂ¶PDQLVFRPSOHWHG. Now, although this finale clearly gestures (once again) to the traditional detective novel, where after a period of disruption and an admittedly conclusive, linear investigation, things finally return to normal, it does something more besides. The circularity involved here Â² and throughout Â² SURYLGHVDQRWKHUÂµSRHWLFÂ¶tribute to Manouchian, structurally mirroring the life of the man who escaped deportations, concentration camps and genocide in Armenia (2009a: 56-58), only to find the Nazis doing 7 the same thing in Europe, and who, Daeninckx stresses, was executed the day before his wedding anniversary (2009a: 98). $WOHDVWSDUWRIWKHVLJQLILFDQFHRI'DHQLQFN[Â¶VLQGLYLGXDOREVHVVLRQZLWK Manouchian and his colleagues is that it is part of a much broader commemorative thrust. In February 2004, the sixtieth anniversary of the executions was remembered at a ceremony at Mont ValÃ©rien, while Rino Della 1HJUDÂ¶VIRRWEDOOFOXE5HG6WDUXQYHLOHGDSODTXHLQKLV honour before the team went on to play Â² VLJQLILFDQWO\JLYHQWKHJURXSÂ¶VOLQNVWRWKDW part of the world Â² OÂ¶$UPpnienne (the Armenian team). Daeninckx attended this match (Allezredstar, 2004; Maricourt, 2009: 179), and was clearly inspired by the event as it serves as the narrative present in Viva la libertÃ©. These two celebrations were quickly followed by a mass of others, and in a variety of areas. In 2009, the book-reading public could not only HQMR\'DHQLQFN[Â¶VMissak and 0LVVDNOÂ¶HQIDQWGHOÂ¶$IILFKHURXJHEXWDOVR$ODLQ%ORWWLqUHÂ¶V Le Tombeau de Tommy (which focuses on another important member of the Manouchian group, one who likewise traYHUVHV'DHQLQFN[Â¶VWH[WVRQWKHVXEMHFW7KRPDV(OHNIn the area of the YLVXDODUWV5REHUW*XpGLJXLDQÂ¶VFRQWURYHUVLDOILOP/Â¶$UPpHGXFrime (2009) undeniably stands out, but other noteworthy developments include the DVD release of Frank &DVVHQWLÂ¶V movie, /Â¶$IILFKHURXJH (2008), and the appearance of two documentaries: $PDWDQG3HVFKDQVNLÂ¶V/D7UDTXHGHOÂ¶$IILFKHURXJH (2006), which aired on television on 15 March 2007, and 0LFKHO,RQDVFXÂ¶VMissak Manouchian, une esquisse de portrait (2012), to which Daeninckx contributed, and which toured a number of community arts centres. In a different branch of the visual arts, a huge painting of Manouchian on the side of a building in Paris was unveiled (March 2012), and although it was later to be defaced with racist graffiti (Le75020, 2014), this actually served to keep its subject in the news. At the same time as all of these tributes were taking place, the succession of more formal, public commemorations continued. On 21 February 2009, a plaque was unveiled at 11, rue de Plaisance in Paris, to 8 mark the site where Manouchian and his wife last lived, while an indirect homage was made on 8 March 2012, when the aforementioned ArsÃ¨ne Tchakarian was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour for his work on the group, with President Sarkozy making clear precisely ZKDWWKHLQGLYLGXDODXWKRUÂ¶Vcontribution to the nation (and, implicitly it might be said, the contribution of all of WKRVHPHQWLRQHGKHUHDPRXQWHGWRÂµ0HPRU\LVWKHZULWLQJRI\RXU ERRNVÂ¶Tchakarian, 2012: 298). More recently, in February 2014, seventy years after the executions, Red Star, which has regularly organized commemorations, again celebrated the life of Rino Della Negra, while there was another ceremony at Mont ValÃ©rien, attended by dignitaries such as President FranÃ§ois Hollande and Charles Aznavour, whose own family is part of the Manouchian story, and whose fame Â² like the Red Star football matches Â² has helped to keep it alive in popular culture. Currently, there is a campaign to get the ashes of those executed transferred to the PanthÃ©on, the ultimate accolade. Needless to say, Daeninckx is one of the signatories of the on-line petition (Manouchian-panthÃ©on, 2014). If this broader context shows that Daeninckx is very much in tune with, if not slightly ahead of his time, as he has been ever since his break-through novel, Meurtres pour mÃ©moire (1983),10 this is not to say that he has abandoned his role of rebel and militant activist. On the contrary. By praising the Manouchian group, he is able, as is his wont, to underline the long- neglected contribution made to France by non-natives. It is not for nothing that the sub-title of Avec le groupe Manouchian is Les ImmigrÃ©s dans la RÃ©sistance (Immigrants in the Resistance),11 nor that, within its pages, when a unit of soldiers from the collaborationist LVF (Legion of French Volunteers against Bolshevism) marches past, one of the Resisters says: Âµ:HZKRZHUHERUQLQDOOIRXUcorners of the earth, in Hungary, Armenia, Poland, Romania, [...] we are doing more for this country than those loud-mouths on parade protected by their PDVWHUVÂ¶ (2010: 32-33). Yet Daeninckx is not simply making a point about the Occupation here. As ever (see Maricourt, 2009: 212, 214, 217), he believes that the past is relevant to the 9 present Â² DFRQQHFWLRQDOUHDG\LPSOLFLWLQKLVXVHRIWKH)DXFKÂ¶PDQPHWDSKRULQMissak Â² and that racism, anti-Semitism and fascism live on, and still need to be countered. This is why, in his various texts on the Manouchian group, he includes quotations from the extreme right-wing press of the time. This is why, in the Epilogue of Avec le groupe Manouchian, he has his now-adult narrator say: It will soon be seventy years since the gunshots rang out over the hill at Mont ValÃ©rien, but not a single day has passed since without me trying to prolong the echo. To warn of the danger. (2010: 99) This is also why, in the same book (2010: 38-40), the blowing up of a pro-Nazi bookshop (by Thomas Elek) by means of a book bomb has great symbolic value Â² it represents the explosive power of literature and the ability to use it as a weapon,12 qualities that the author himself exploits to denounce the threats he sees around him. One way to combat this menace is, of course, to make sure that everyone is aware of LW7KLVWRRLVSDUWRI'DHQLQFN[Â¶VSURMHFWÂ² to inform (cf. Maricourt, 2009: 274). Thus, in Missak, details are given of a number of things about which, it is stated, ÂµQRERG\VSHDNVÂ¶ including the role of women in the Resistance and two executed Resisters, Georges Gruman and Maurice Brover (2009a: 91 & 169; 213 respectively). It is on Manouchian himself, however, that Daeninckx claims to shed most new light, thanks largely to his discovery of, in KLVRZQZRUGVÂµDQXPEHURIXQSXEOLVKHGGRFXPHQWVRIZKLFKWKHKLVWRULDQVZHUHXQDZDUHÂ¶ (Daeninckx, 2009c: 153. Cf. Rubino, 2009: 179-80). This wish to enlighten, this attempt to bolster memory and to XVHKLVZULWLQJÂµWR counter REOLYLRQÂ¶(Maricourt, 2009: 211) leads Daeninckx to accompany his tribute to the Manouchian group with a whole host of unsavoury facts from the Occupation. Some are presented at length, others only in passing, but the cumulative effect is striking. Most visibly, perhaps, he reminds his readers that the French special Brigades arrested Manouchian and his 10 colleagues, engaged in torture and generally acted dishonourably (in ,WLQpUDLUHGÂ¶XQVDODXG ordinaire, there is ironic reference throXJKRXWWRWKHÂµFRXUGÂ¶KRQQHXUÂ¶Â² the central FRXUW\DUGOLWHUDOO\WKHÂµFRXUW\DUGRIKRQRXUÂ¶Â² at the Paris police headquarters). He also recalls other collaborators, of varying commitment and motivation: the French volunteers of the LVF, the SS Charlemagne Division, the Milice (Militia), and the French Gestapo; the judges; anGWKHVHQGHUVRIWKHÂµPLOOLRQVÂ¶of letters of denunciation. At the same time, he turns the spotlight onto )UDQFHÂ¶V persecution of Jews Â² pointing out that they were sometimes betrayed by their own co-religionaries (2006: 47-49; 2009a: 91) Â² and highlights a number of eloquent events linked to the Liberation, such as the failure properly to purge those who had compromised themselves, a failure which is of course linked to his current warnings about neo-Nazism. The Resistance, and specifically the Communist Resistance, does not escape 'DHQLQFN[Â¶Vadmonishing gaze either. In Missak, as mentioned earlier, WKHÂµ$UP\RIFULPHÂ¶is revealed to be riven by factionalism and betrayed by its own members twice, while the PCFÂ¶V move, in the course of the Occupation, from non-belligerence to full-blown guerrilla warfare is shown massively to complicate the moral landscape. In fact, as is so much else, this breaking down of simplistic, black-and-white certainties is embodied by the Manouchian group itself, for it included a German (an antifascist, and an inverted mirror image of the Frenchmen who fought for Hitler), and its leader was a poet-warrior, an intellectual man of action (as too is Daeninckx). 'DHQLQFN[Â¶Vattempt to underline the complexity of the Occupation for his readers goes hand in hand, quite naturally, with a recognition of some of the problems involved in trying to recover the past. In Missak, the information that Louis accumulates is often contradictory (2009a: 185), the recollections of eye-witnesses are unreliable (2009a: 110), and to make matters worse, there are Machiavellian forces at workÂµ0HPRU\FDQRIWHQEH 11 seen to be organizeGIRUJHWIXOQHVVÂ¶+HQU\5RXVVRKDVobserved (1987: 14), and Paul Ricoeur has similarly highlighted ÂµWKHDEXVHV>Â«@UHVXOWLQJIURPDFRQFHUWHGPDQLSXODWLRQRIPHPRU\ DQGIRUJHWIXOQHVVE\WKRVHLQSRZHUÂ¶(2003: 97). This is precisely what Louis discovers Â² the references to betrayal which are LQ0DQRXFKLDQÂ¶VILQDOOHWWHUKDYH mysteriously disappeared from the transcripts prepared by the PCF (2009a: 185). Then there is the problem of writing about the past, DSUREOHPHQFDSVXODWHGE\'DHQLQFN[Â¶Vown preference for historical fiction, where the boundary between history and invention is blurred. Undeniably, much of the DXWKRUÂ¶VZRUNIRUDQGLQMissak is that of a historian. He has conducted research, consulted archives and eye-witnesses, discovered new documents, and then published the results, portraying historical figures, reproducing source material, and including a bibliography.13 Yet the paratext insists that WKLVÂµGHQVHO\UHIHUHQWLDOWH[WÂ¶$WDFN is a novel, and this assertion is fully justified within its pages, fRUMXVWDV/RXLVÂ¶VLQYHVWLJDWLRQUHSUHVHQWVWKH 3&)Â¶VORRNLQJLQRQLWVHOIVRWRRLVWKLVWH[WEODWDQWO\VHOI-aware (cf. Atack, 2013: 176, 181). A good example of this is its central portrayal of the writing process Â² writing as investigation, writing as re-writing Â² as Louis amasses the details that eventually inform his report. Furthermore, the large role played by literature and quotation (as shown by +XJRÂ¶V aforementioned poem) is impossible to miss,14 as is the citing of the associated creative arts of film, painting and song (cf. Daeninckx, 2010: 8). Throw into this mix 'DHQLQFN[Â¶Vmany mises en abyme, as demonstrated earlier, and what we have here is a form that underlines the interrogative nature of the text. Are historical and literary narratives really all that different? Is a divide between the intra- and extra-textual worlds actually relevant to literature? How much confidence can people have in official memory, in official history, or even in archives? These are just some of the questions that Daeninckx is asking (see also Atack, 2013). He is also asking questions about identity. Speaking of his own works decades after the Liberation, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2014, Patrick Modiano, 12 admittedÂµ)or me, many of the historical figures cited are almost characters from legends. I feel as if they are some sort of mythÂ¶ (Montalbetti, 1969: 43). Daeninckx, in Missak, seems to be in a similar situation, very much aware that Manouchian is not so much a man as Â² just like the Greek boy iQ+XJRÂ¶VSRHPZKLFKHYRNHVKLP Â² a linguistic construct, or to reapply $WDFNÂ¶VFRPPHQWRQWKHZKROHJURXSÂµDSURGXFWRIQDUUDWLYHDQGLGHRORJLFDOSURFHVVHVÂ¶ (2013: 177). During the Occupation, the rebel leader became a criminal, a bogey-man, this identity forged for him by OÂ¶$IILFKHURXJH and collaborationist journalists. Then after the war, he became an exemplary Resister, an idealized icon of the PCF, as vaunted, along with his group, LQ$UDJRQÂ¶VSRHP It is the simplification of this second myth that is the major cause of concern for Daeninckx. Âµ7he statue erected in his honour puts WKHKHURLQWKHVKDGHÂ¶the novelist has lamented (Rubino, 2009: 181), and the self-same worry is equally evident in Missak, as expressed via one of its key leitmotifs Â² the rising level of the Seine and associated flooding, which result in the gradual disappearance into the river of the statue of the Zouave on the 3RQWGHOÂ¶$OPD$OPDEULGJH. The Zouave, of course, is a foreign French fighter, just like Manouchian, and the allusive threat posed is made clear when the army has to move things out of the cellars of Notre-Dame, the storerooms of the Louvre and the archives of the Palais- Bourbon ÂµVRWKDWWKHPHPRULHVVWRUHGXQGHUJURXQd >Â«@DUHQRWVZDPSHGÂ¶ (Daeninckx, 2009a: 213).15 Daeninckx is engaged in similar salvage work.16 As suggested by his use of metaphors Â² another example of self-aware mirroring Â² he wants to get to the story beneath the surface storyÂµWRVFUatch away to see what lies behind, to give free rein to the power of PHPRU\Â¶0DULFRXUW, 2009: 71). He wants to combat the idealized myth, to paint a more complex picture RI0DQRXFKLDQDQGÂµJLYHDQHZDQGVXUSULVLQJGLPHQVLRQWR>KLV@FKDUDFWHUÂ¶ (Daeninckx, 2009c: 153), to give him back his humanity, his identity, and thereby provide him with the tribute he merits. In so doing, he can simultaneously mount a more general 13 attack, and denounce the ÂµLQVWUXPHQWDOLV>DWLRQRI@WKHKHURLFVDFULILFHRIWKH5HVLVWDQFHÂ¶that had become such a striking feature of the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy (Raymond, 2013: 99 and passim), and of which he would have been all too aware when he was writing Missak and its companion volumes. The preceding analysis would seem to suggest that, in many ways, a useful reference point IRU'DHQLQFN[Â¶s personal and, often, the more widespread, obsession with Manouchian LVJLYHQE\3LHUUH1RUDÂ¶VFHOHEUDWHG Lieux de mÃ©moire (1984-92) and his innovative concept of the realms or sites of memory.

Whether Nora intended his study to be limited to his own time or not (III.3 (1992): 1012), the fact remains that the Manouchian group now appears to have become another, albeit contemporary, ÂµVLWHRIPHPRU\Â¶LQ)UDQFH.17 Apart from this fundamental relevance, there are further ways in which Les Lieux de mÃ©moire resonate with the current trend RISD\LQJKRPDJHWRÂµWKH$UP\RI FULPHÂ¶, and especially with 'DHQLQFN[Â¶V approach. Like Daeninckx, in addition to memory, Nora is concerned with French history Â² RQHRIKLVFKDSWHUVLVHQWLWOHGÂµ+RZVKRXOGWKHKLVWRU\RI )UDQFHEHZULWWHQ"Â¶,,,-32).

What is more, DNH\HOHPHQWRI'DHQLQFN[Â¶VILFWLRQ is the revelation of unsavoury details about the Occupation, but Nora himself posits that this might be a weakness of his own work when he rehearses some of the possible criticisms of his previous volumes in his final tome: amongst the things not dealt with, he notes, is ÂµHYHU\WKLQJ)UDQFHUHSUHVVHVDQGGRHVQRWZDQWWRNQRZDERXWLWVHOIÂ¶,,, In his analysis of a different novel by Daeninckx (Le Der des ders), centred on a different conflict (World War I), Martin Hurcombe demonstrates how the novelist RYHUFRPHVÂµWKHELQDU\ opposition of history to memory, incorporating a pluralising, contestatory memory that enriches our historical understanding of the war, revealing previously occluded aspects of its politically complex reality, thereby undermining a monolithic post-war narrative of national XQLW\Â¶The same applies to the DXWKRUÂ¶VManouchian project, and it is no doubt at least partly because of this ÂµSOXUDOLVLQJÂ¶heretical impulse Â² and probably also because of ILFWLRQÂ¶VJUHDWHUDELOLW\WRKDQGOHthe sort of unreliable, contradictory and often fragmentary information referred to earlier Â² that Daeninckx has chosen to write novels, albeit historical novels, rather than histories Ã  la Nora. %HIRUHFRQFOXGLQJLWZLOOEHKHOSIXOWRFRQVLGHURQHILQDODVSHFWRI'DHQLQFN[Â¶V Manouchian project Â² the importance of different generations. In Missak, Louis is a young man in 1954-55, and was still in his mid-teens when the war ended. Aliona, the narrator of Avec le groupe Manouchian, is even younger during the Occupation, when the main narrative 15 is set. In both cases, there is a marked parental absence (2009a: 84, 217, 154-55; 2010: 5, 14- 15, 38, 55), and what this equates to is clear: a young generation cut off from its roots and lacking a heritage, as symbolized by the missing parents.19 In her recent study of French crime fiction and the Second World War, Claire Gorrara has spoken of this self-same problem of a lack of transmission of the past, and recognized the UROHRIFKLOGUHQÂ¶Vcrime books Â² DQGLQGHHG'DHQLQFN[Â¶VFKLOGUHQÂ¶s books Â² in any attempt to solve it (Gorrara, 2012). Although the works in question here cannot, for one reason or another, assuredly be classified as crime fiction, provide a remedy is precisely what Daeninckx is trying to do. His two FKLOGUHQÂ¶VERRNVon Manouchian include a range of paratextual support Â² an interview, photographs, reproductions of letters, and so on Â² to reinforce the impact of the actual narratives. They are nothing if not well documented.20 In this light, the very end of Missak is revealing. Part of the positive conclusion that has already been described LVWKHUHWXUQRI/RXLVÂ¶Vpreviously absent mother, a sign that, now that his investigation into the Manouchian group is over, at least part of his, and by extension WKHQDWLRQÂ¶VOost heritage and identity has been restored. However, quite apart from the sense of circularity generated and the other non-totalizing literary techniques already mentioned, the complete story has not been told. Louis has not met up with all of the key witnesses, and what really happened remains, to his mind, a jigsaw with pieces missing, so much so that he readily admits that he has not understood everything (2009a: 273, 278). This sense of unresolved business remaining Â² which in turn UHIOHFWV'DHQLQFN[Â¶V general distrust of official consensus and memorial closure Â² is much more noticeable in the Epilogue to Avec le groupe Manouchian, where the now grown-up Aliona reveals that she is still going into schools to talk about her experience of the Resistance, in much the same way as Daeninckx, in a further blurring of boundaries, extends his work to teenagers and young children. 16 This is worthy of note. The widespread reassessment of the Occupation that emerged in France in the 1970s, dubbed the mode rÃ©tro (retro fashion), showed that this problem of the transmission of knowledge about the war years, with all of its implications for individual and national memory and identity, badly affected the younger war and post-war generations Â² the generations of Louis, Aliona, and indeed Daeninckx himself (he was born in 1949). Yet forty or so years later, another one or two generations further on, the battle for hearts and minds is evidently still being fought, and it is in this context that the existence of one, final metaphor might be suggested. Insofar as the Manouchian group is a collective made up of individual parts, occasionally marked by betrayal, anchored in both the past and the present, and open to manipulation by people in positions of power, would it be wrong to see it as a sort of embodiment of memory in the abstract, the implicit subject of 'DHQLQFN[Â¶V investigation? To conclude, as may by now be clear, 'DHQLQFN[Â¶V0DQRXFKLDQSURMHFWH[SUHVVHV itself over a number of years, in a variety of formats, and with different target audiences. What appears to motivate him, besides the basic, understandable wish to tell a good story, is a mixture of inter-related drives. He wants to commemorate the freedom fighters concerned; praise, through them, the contribution made by non-natives to France; show Â² and warn his compatriots Â² that the problems posed by the war have not gone away; give a more rounded picture of the Occupation in general and of Missak Manouchian in particular; and counter the ongoing political exploitation and misrepresentation of the Resistance. In doing this, he additionally raises questions about literature, history, recollection, and the recoverability of the past, targeting especially the young, in an attempt to increase their knowledge of the war years and, despite the obvious difficulties involved, EROVWHUWKHLUDQGWKHQDWLRQÂ¶VLGHQWLW\. This quest, as may by now also be clear, takes on a distinctive form. Prime amongst 'DHQLQFN[Â¶VQDUUDWLYHVWUDWHJLHVÂ² both within his individual, often interrogative texts and 17 sometimes between them Â² are metaphor, repetition, circularity, intertextuality and mise en abyme. Indeed, such mirror-SOD\FDQHYHQEHVHHQRQDIDUEURDGHUOHYHOZLWKWKHDXWKRUÂ¶V Manouchian project representing a microcosm of the wider concern with the combat unit.21 What this ultimately suggests, of course, is a lack of finality, as any one narrative tends to lead on to something or somewhere else. This is important, and not merely because it further UHIOHFWV'DHQLQFN[Â¶Vdisaffection with RIILFLDOGRPÂ¶Vpursuit of resolution. Given that his personal venture is also a smaller version of the fascination with the dark years of 1940-1944 in general, his refusal of easy closure may be extrapolated to this much higher level as well, and taken (along with his choice of subject matter) as another (if more evocative) sign of the phenomenon that John Flower has recently analyzed so well (2014) Â² the fact that the country is still, as it were, locked in the circle of remembrance, still SODJXHGE\ÂµWKHW\UDQQ\ RIPHPRU\Â¶1RUD,,,; that it is still awaiting its final liberation from the Occupation; and that the words of Conan and Rousso, expressed way back in 1994, still palpably ring true: France continues to be in the grip of ÂµXQSDVVpTXLQHSDVVHSDVÂ¶a naggingly LQGLJHVWLEOHÂµHYHU-SUHVHQWSDVWÂ¶ (Conan & Rousso, 1994, 1998).22 18 Works Cited Unless otherwise indicated, all books listed are published in Paris. /Â¶$IILFKHURXJH Directed by F.

This latter text also depicts a real-life member of the French Gestapo, Alex Villaplane, who was a former French international footballer; he therefore serves as a sort of inverted image of the footballing Resister, Rino Della Negra. 7 +HURGRWXVZULWHVÂµ+HUHDUHVHWIRUWKWKHKLVWRULHVRI+HURGRWXVRI+DOLFDUQDVVXVWKDWPHQÂ¶VDFWLRQVPD\QRWLQ time be forgotten nor things great and wonderful, accomplished whether by Greeks or barbarians, go without UHSRUWÂ¶ 8 This is even more pronounced in 0LVVDNRXOÂ¶HQIDQWGHOÂ¶$IILFKHURXge, where one of the illustrations shows an artist in the process of sketching Manouchian, so there is a double, not a single, pictorial representation. 9 It was, in fact, precisely these tributes which caused Daeninckx to set his novel in the winter of 1954-55 (Rubino, 2009: 181). 10 See e.g. Maricourt, 2009: 215, 220. 11 Similarly, the documentary section at the end of 0LVVDNOÂ¶HQIDQWGHOÂ¶$IILFKHURXJH LVHQWLWOHGÂµ0LVVDN 0DQRXFKLDQHWOHVLPPLJUpVUpVLVWDQWVGHOÂ¶$IILFKHURXJHÂ¶0LVVDN0DQRXFKLDQDQGWKHLPPLJUDQWUHVLVWHUVon the Affiche rouge). 12 Cf.

More broadly, considering WKDWLQKLVÂ°XYUHDVDZKROHlike many other contemporary French novelists, Daeninckx does not restrict himself to the dark years of the 1940s, but extends his explorations to a range of troublesome periods of French 23 history Â²World War I and the Algerian War amongst them Â² it might well be argued that both he and France are in thrall to the, rather than to an, ever-present past. It is a topic that could usefully be explored.
