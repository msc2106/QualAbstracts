ABSTRACT: 
Sediment proxy records from a continuous, 1.5 million year long deep-sea sediment core from a site in the western Norwegian Sea were used to obtain new insights into the nature of palaeoceanographic change in the northern North Atlantic (Nordic seas) during the climatic shift of the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (MPR). Red-green sediment colour and magnetic susceptibility records both reveal significant differences in their mean values when comparing the intervals older than 700 000 yr (700 ka) with those from the past 500 kyr. The timing and duration of these changes indicates that the MPR in the Nordic seas is characterised by a gradual transition lasting about 200 kyr. Together with further sedimentological evidence this suggests that the mid-Pleistocene climate shift was accompanied by a general change in ice-drift pattern. It is further proposed that prior to the onset of the major late Pleistocene glaciations in the Northern Hemisphere a significant proportion of the ice in the eastern Nordic seas originated from a southern provenance, whereas later it dominantly came from the surrounding landmasses.

Introduction Proxy data of sediments from deep-sea cores of the Northern Hemisphere give clear evidence for a striking difference between the palaeoclimatic conditions of the early and late Pleistocene (e.g. Henrich, 1989; Jansen and Sjøholm, 1991; Fronval and Jansen, 1996). This climatic change is known as the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (MPR) and characterises a shift towards the strong climatic contrasts with alternating periods of massive continental ice-sheet accumulation and decay known from late Pleistocene glacial and interglacial climate intervals. This switch in climate variability during the MPR accompanies a change from an obliquity-dominated climate mode, i.e. climate fluctuations characterised by a periodicity of about 41 000 yr (41 kyr), to an eccentricity-dominated one with variability centred at a period near 100 kyr (e.g. Pisias and Moore, 1981; Ruddiman et al., 1986; Berger and Jansen, 1994). It is still under debate, however, whether the nature of the climate transition was gradual (e.g. Ruddiman et al., 1989) or abrupt (e.g. Berger and Wefer, 1992). A number * Correspondence to: Jan P.

The late Pleistocene palaeoclimatic conditions at high north- ern latitudes are very well documented in palaeoceanographic proxy records from the northern North Atlantic region, i.e. the Nordic seas. Records of planktonic oxygen isotopes, ice- rafted debris (IRD) and carbonate contents from deep-sea sediments of this region indicate that the high northern latitudes were characterised by short, warm interglacial episodes with extended glacial periods in between (e.g. Fronval and Jansen, 1997; Henrich, 1998; Bauch et al., 2000). However, so far there are only a few long, continuous records from the Nordic seas that provide detailed information about the climatic con- ditions of the times just before and after the MPR (e.g. Jansen et al., 1988, 1990; Wolf and Thiede, 1991; Baumann and Huber, 1999). Accordingly, the knowledge about the nature of environmental change at high northern latitudes during the MPR is patchy. Little is known, for instance, about changes in ice-drift patterns related to the mid-Pleistocene climate shift. The purpose of this paper therefore is to use high-resolution sedimentological proxy data from a deep-sea sediment core in the western Norwegian Sea that covers approximately the past 1.5 million years. The time coverage of the core is ideal to unveil some aspects of the palaeoceanographic conditions in the Nordic seas before and after the MPR. 184 JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE Core material and methods Core MD992277 (69°15′N, 6°19′W; Fig. 1) was recovered in 1999 during the IMAGES V campaign using the CALYPSO piston core system onboard R/V Marion Dufresne. Immediately after drilling the core, about 34 m long, was cut into sections 1.5 m long and the physical properties of the sediment were measured onboard. Thereafter, the core was split open into two sections and a detailed core description as well as sediment colour measurements were undertaken. Density and magnetic susceptibility were measured onboard at 2-cm steps. Magnetic remanence and low field bulk (volume) were measured at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. Magnetic data were aquired every 2 cm from u-channel samples, which constitute continuous sampling of core sections having 1.5 m length and a 2 × 2 cm cross-section (see Tauxe et al., 1983). Stepwise demagnetisation of magnetic remanence was performed at 5-mT steps from 10 to 60 mT using the high-resolution small access 2 G passthrough magnetometer with online alternating field (AF) device installed in Gif-sur-Yvette (Weeks et al., 1993). Sediment colour, i.e. sediment lightness, (L∗) and red- green colour (a∗) was remeasured in 1-cm steps using a Minolta CM-2002 spectrophotometer (onboard colour measurements were originally done in 5-cm steps). Bulk carbonate content (% of weight) was measured every 5 cm using a LECO C-200 carbon determinator at GEOMAR. The down-core records of all these sediment properties and proxies are summarised in Fig. 2. Age model construction Several sedimentological parameters were used to obtain an age model for core MD992277. Core PS1243 (69°22′N, 6°32′W), located in the immediate vicinity of the study site (Fig. 1), has an established age model dating back to marine isotope stage (MIS) 12 (Fig. 3a). It is based on correlation of the oxygen isotope data (also taking bulk carbonate content and IRD records into account; see Bauch et al., 2000; Bauch and Erlenkeuser, in press) to the standard SPECMAP chronology (Imbrie et al., 1984; Martinson et al., 1987). The colour scanning results from MD992277 (Fig. 3a), i.e. mainly a seven-point moving average smoothing of the red- green colour as well as lightness were correlated to the same records from PS1243 (colour analysing method for PS1243 is the same as described for MD992277).

Note that the carbonate content and inclination measurements do not cover the entire core sections points linear interpolation was applied, thus leading to an age model for the upper 1200 cm of site MD992277 that pene- trates MOIS 12 (Fig. 3a). As the uppermost 50 cm of sediment from MD992277 are disturbed owing to the Calypso coring method, the age of the sediment surface at the study site was taken from the surface sample of nearby PS1243. Ages between the sediment surface and the age of the first tie point of the colour records were interpolated. In the depth interval 1200–1800 cm the records of density, sediment lightness and bulk CaCO3 content were used to identify cold and warm marine isotope stages (Fig. 3b). Warm intervals are characterised by high carbonate content and sediment lightness values as well as low density values. In contrast, cold intervals typically show low carbonate content and sediment lightness values but an increased density. This is in agreement with many previous palaeoceanographic studies on Pleistocene sediments from the Nordic seas (e.g. Henrich, 1998; Bauch and Helmke, 1999). Several major warm and cold events between MOIS 12.4 and 19.3 can be identified (Fig. 3b). Ages for these events were assigned following the SPECMAP chronology (Imbrie et al., 1984). As for the upper core sections, linear interpolation was applied between the various tie points. The carbonate content of the study site was determined from 1050 cm down to the base of the core (Fig. 3b). However, as previously observed at other Nordic seas sites (Jansen et al., 1988; Henrich, 1989), sediments from parts of the Matuyama chron are almost barren of any carbonate, probably owing to intense carbonate dissolution (Jansen et al., 1988). Consequently, in the lower part of the sediment record magnetic inclination was used to obtain additional tie points for the age model (Fig. 3b). Several major and minor polarity events of the magnetic Brunhes and Matuyama chrons also identified in the North Atlantic (Channell et al., 2002), i.e. Santa Rosa, Jaramillo, Cobb Mountain and Gardar, could be identified within the magnetic inclination record (Fig. 3b). Using linear sedimentation rates between these tie points the interpolated ages indicate that core MD992277 dates back to approximately 1.5 Ma. Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. J.

Dashed black lines show that interglacial MOIS are characterised by a high carbonate content as well as high lightness and low density values.

Magnetic polarity events of the inclination record are labelled Records of magnetic susceptibility and sediment colour The mean values of magnetic susceptibility over the entire record reveal a significant change from generally higher val- ues, characterising the older sediment sections, towards lower values in the younger part (Fig. 4). The sediments before 700 ka fluctuate around a mean magnetic susceptibility value of 72.8, whereas after about 500 ka a much lower mean value of only 45.1 is noted (Fig. 4). The interval between 700 and 500 ka represents a period of transition between these two levels showing a continuous decrease of mean magnetic susceptibil- ity values.

In general, intervals of increased a∗ values in a sediment colour record point to more reddish sediments, whereas lower a∗ values are typical for a more greenish colour of the sediment. At site MD992277 the a∗ values rise from 0.5 characterising the interval of more greenish sediments older than 700 ka to a mean value of 3.6 for the more reddish sediment sections from the past 500 kyr. However, in comparison with the magnetic susceptibility signal the colour record differs in some respect: the section older than 700 ka reveals a second but somewhat smaller change in the mean red-green colour values. In particular the sediments prior to about 1.1 Ma are characterised by slightly lower values than between 1.1 Ma and 700 ka. Moreover, the red-green colour record from the period between 500 and 700 ka does not show a continuous increase of a∗ values but is characterised by minimum values centred at about 600 ka. This minimum is followed by a steep rise to the maximum level within the entire red-green colour record (Fig. 4). Both sediment parameters clearly reveal a significant change of mean values during the mid-Pleistocene. The timing of these transitions from lower red-green colour and higher magnetic susceptibility values prior to 700 ka to higher red-green colour and lower magnetic susceptibility values after 500 ka strongly indicates that the observed changes are related to the overall palaeoclimatic changes that occurred during the course of the MPR. Discussion Red-green colour variations of deep-sea sediments in the North Atlantic are driven primarily by changes in the concentration of several iron- and manganese-bearing components (Nagao and Nakashima, 1992). Hence, several mechanisms can cause the variability in the red-green colour record of MD992277: a number of studies on Quaternary sediments from the Northeast Atlantic revealed that the input of terrigenous reddish material into the sediment can be linked to the transport of ice- rafted sediments (e.g. Bond et al., 1997, 1999). A correlation between changes in the input of IRD and the variability of red-green sediment colour reflectance was proposed for late Pleistocene sediments from this region (Helmke et al., 2002). In general, intervals of reduced or enhanced bottom water flow in the Nordic seas may also alter the concentration of specific terrigenous components in the sediment (Moros et al., 1997) and, subsequently, the sediment colour.

Grey curve underlying the red-green colour and magnetic susceptibility records represents a polynomial smoothing of the records to illustrate the general trend of both curves. Shaded area between about 700 and 500 ka denotes the shift from high mean values of magnetic susceptibility in the older sediment sections towards lower mean values during the past 500 kyr (and lower mean values of red-green colour before 700 ka towards higher values in the sediment sections younger than 500 ka). Horizontal, stippled lines show mean magnetic susceptibility and red-green colour values before and after the shift in values. The corresponding mean values are also given for reference of pore-water chemistry on the red-green colour record of MD992277, e.g. an oxidation of minerals containing Fe2+ into Fe3+ within the sediment (Canfield, 1989), may be another possibility. However, the simultaneous change of mean red-green colour and magnetic susceptibility values makes it most likely that changes in the input of sediment components, i.e. in the transport mechanism and/or transport direction of terrigenous material to the core site, are the reason for the observed changes in the sediment colour record. This means that in the course of the MPR the portion of reddish components delivered to the core site increased, leading to a higher mean in a∗ values over the past 500 kyr. This implies also that the shift in mean red-green colour values cannot be related to differences between glacial and interglacial climatic conditions, as for the entire Pleistocene in the Northern Hemisphere these contrasts were strongest during the past 600 kyr or so (e.g. Fronval and Jansen, 1996; Baumann and Huber, 1999). Magnetic susceptibility measures the degree of magnetisa- tion of a certain material (Opdyke and Channell, 1996) and is controlled by the nature, the size and the abundance of ferro/ferrimagnetic grains, by paramagnetic minerals (clays) and also by non-magnetic (diamagnetic) minerals such as carbonates, which can dilute the magnetic phase. The input of magnetic particles may be aeolian (Verosup and Roberts, 1995), via ice-rafting (Robinson et al., 1995), and ocean cur- rent systems (McCave et al., 1995; Kissel et al., 1999). Site MD992277 is located northeast of Iceland, i.e. north of the Tertiary basaltic province that stretches from Scotland to south- east Greenland (Fig. 1), a region that is known to be the main source area of magnetic minerals in sediments south of Iceland (Moros et al., 1997; Kissel et al., 1999). The results from MD992277 point to a single, significant mid-Pleistocene change in the mean values of the susceptibility and colour records from the past 1.5 Myr. We suggest that this mid-Pleistocene change reflects a modification of the total input of terrigenous material into the sediment caused by ice rafting, i.e. sediment input by icebergs and/or sea-ice drift. This ice-rafted transport is a main contribution to the total input of terrigenous material at high-northern latitude sediment sites. Previous studies from other regions in the North Atlantic have shown that major variations in the mean magnetic susceptibility signal of sediments may be linked to changes in the composition of the deposited terrigenous ice- rafted material, i.e. they may indicate a change in source regions and transport mechanisms of IRD (e.g. Robinson et al., 1995; Stoner et al., 1995). Especially with respect to the colour record, the export of sediment by sea-ice may explain the observed shift at the mid-Pleistocene. It is known that the sea-ice extent in the Nordic seas and the subsequent release of sediment from the melting ice varied during recent times (Berner and Wefer, 1994; Ramseier et al., 1999, 2001; Peinert et al., 2001). The Arctic Ocean’s marginal areas have some red-bed sediment outcrops and, thus, are a potential source area for the input of fine-grained, red-coloured sediments into the Nordic seas via sea-ice transport. A sea-ice export of sediments from the Arctic Ocean into the Nordic seas has been described previously (Pfirman et al., 1997; Ramseier et al., 1999). Also, it has to be considered that silt and clay may drift over large distances after the release from the drifting ice before they finally reach the sea-floor (e.g. Ramseier et al., 2001). Hence, the intensification of glacial conditions during the past about 600 kyr could have been accompanied by increased sea-ice transport from the Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. J. Quaternary Sci., Vol. 18(2) 183–191 (2003) ICE-DRIFT PATTERN IN THE NORDIC SEAS 189 Arctic regions and release of reddish silt and clay into the Nordic seas. Iceland was repeatedly covered by ice sheets prior to the MPR (Eiriksson and Geirsdottir, 1991), and there are some indications that the same holds true for the British Isles (Rose and Allen, 1977). In general, direct evidence for the existence of early and middle Pleistocene glaciations on the Northern Hemisphere continents are rare. Investigations of trough-mouth fans on the northwest European margin indicate that ice streams did not extend onto the shelf before the mid-Pleistocene (Vorren and Laberg, 1997). However, the amount of ice-rafted input into the Nordic seas during the Pleistocene gives some indication about the relative intensity of glaciations on the adjacent continents at that period (e.g. Jansen et al., 1988; Fronval and Jansen, 1996; Baumann and Huber, 1999). Based on such data it seems evident that continental glaciers repeatedly reached the shelf regions during the entire Pleistocene period with a marked intensification of continental glaciations occurring after the mid-Pleistocene. Onboard investigations of the sediments from site MD992277 revealed an abundant occurrence of Cretaceous coccoliths prior to the MPR, with a prominent layer of chalk IRD at about 900 ka. A similar conspicuous occurrence of Cretaceous coccoliths was not recognised for the upper part of MD992277, although chalk IRD also has been described from other last-glacial sediments in the Nordic seas (Spielhagen, 1991). Since the northeastern boundary of the upper Cretaceous chalk facies extends from the British Isles across the North Sea (Fig. 1, Ziegler, 1990), it seems evident that the Cretaceous chalk material at site MD992277 originated from iceberg rafting, i.e. icebergs that drifted northward from the general North Sea region (see Fig. 1). Iceland and the northern part of the British Isles, Scotland, lie within the Tertiary basaltic province (Fig. 1). Hence, they are potential source regions for a high input of magnetic particles at site MD992277 before the MPR. This is consistent with our observation that the low field susceptibility values are significantly higher before the MPR than after. Moreover, Upper Cretaceous Chalk is also found today in western Scotland and is thought to be the remnant of a much more widespread occurrence that has been largely eroded during Tertiary and Quaternary times (Hallam, 1991). Therefore, an iceberg drift from the northern British Isles might also explain the observed patterns prior to the MPR in core MD992277. In general, the transport direction of drifting icebergs is influenced by ocean surface currents as well as by the prevailing wind systems. During the past about 600 kyr, after the MPR, deep-sea benthic δ18O records indicate a larger glacial ice volume than before the MPR (e.g. Tiedemann et al., 1994). For this time, sedimentological evidence from the Nordic seas (e.g. Jansen et al., 1988; Fronval and Jansen, 1996) points at large ice-sheet cover over the Northern Hemisphere, especially Fennoscandia. This coincided also with a first major development of a Barent Sea ice-sheet noted for MOIS 16, at about 620 ka (Laberg and Vorren, 1996). Studies on the terrigenous components of deep-sea sediments have shown that iceberg-rafting into the central Nordic seas principally originated from the surrounding landmasses (Fig. 1), i.e. Scandinavia and Greenland, but also Iceland and the Barents Sea archipelagos (Henrich, 1989; Krissek, 1989; Baumann et al., 1995; Dowdeswell et al., 1999), which were regions of massive iceberg calving. It is believed that the surface water intrusion into the Nordic seas, i.e. the northward inflow of Atlantic waters, was strongly reduced during late Pleistocene glaciations (e.g. Henrich, 1998; Sarnthein et al., 2001, and references therein). As high regional atmospheric pressure usually builds up over large continental ice-sheets leading to strong katabatic winds, the major expansions of Fennoscandian ice-sheets after 620 ka (Laberg and Vorren, 1996) could have favoured an enhanced, strongly wind-induced iceberg drift from northern directions to the core site. Accordingly, the relative contribution of glacial iceberg drift from southern sources after the MPR was less strong and the terrigenous sediment input to our core site became dominated by icebergs that originated from the ice-sheets around the Nordic seas. The 3.5 Ma long magnetic susceptibility record from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 907 (located at 69 °N and 12 °W on the Iceland Plateau) also reveals a change in the mean susceptibility values during the late Matuyama and Brunhes chrons (Jansen et al., 2000), which corresponds to our observations at site MD992277. At Site 907 the authors find a general relationship between glacial intervals with high IRD content and low field susceptibility. They suggest that the magnetic susceptibility signal is principally related to intensity changes of bottom water currents (cf. Moros et al., 1997). However, both sediment reflection and the physical property data of core MD992277 led us to suggest a somewhat different scenario, in which the respective contributions of the different ice-sheets on iceberg drift into the Nordic seas and on IRD input at site MD992277 significantly changed during the MPR. Also, the intensity of sea-ice drift may have changed across the mid-Pleistocene climate shift. The transition between higher and lower magnetic susceptibility mean values lasted for about 200 kyr (from 700 to 500 ka) supporting other studies that propose a rather long and gradual transition for the MPR (e.g. Hall et al., 2001). Summary Using a number of sediment parameters and additional data from nearby deep-sea sediment an age model for piston core MD992277 from the western Norwegian Sea was established. The sediment at the study site covers approximately the past 1.5 Myr. Data from both the red-green colour of the sediment and from magnetic susceptibility reveal a distinct mid-Pleistocene shift that probably was related to the general climatic change of the MPR. The magnetic susceptibility values were higher before 700 ka when compared with the values after 500 ka, and a coeval change from lower to higher mean values is observed for the red-green colour of the sediment. Between 700 and 500 ka, the values of magnetic susceptibility decreased continuously, whereas the red-green colour values increased. This shift in both sedimentological records, which lasted 200 kyr, indicates a gradual transition of climatic conditions during the MPR. It is suggested that the observed shifts in the proxy records of MD992277 resulted from a general change in the pattern of ice rafting into the Nordic seas. Taking all our sedimentological evidence into account, it is proposed that prior to the mid- Pleistocene climatic shift a substantial northward-directed iceberg drift from the North Sea region existed in the Nordic seas. This is in contrast to the transport pattern of ice after the MPR when the major contribution of icebergs in the Nordic seas originated from the surrounding landmasses, i.e. Scandinavia and Greenland as well as Iceland and the Barent Sea shelf region. Also, after the MPR an increased drift of sea-ice into the Nordic seas may have substantially influenced the total terrigenous input into the sediment.
