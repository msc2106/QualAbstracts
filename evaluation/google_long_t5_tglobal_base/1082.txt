ABSTRACT: 
Patterns of partnership formation and dissolution are changing dramatically across the Western world. Some scholars have argued that women's trajectories of union formation and dissolution are diverging by education, with the higher educated postponing but eventually marrying and the lower educated more likely to cohabit or divorce if they do marry. At the same time, the variation in partnership behavior has also increased across countries, suggesting that country context plays an important role. Here, we use latent class growth models to compare the educational gradient of partnership trajectories in the United States and 14 countries in Europe and investigate the role of education and country context. Our results indicate a consistent positive educational gradient for partnership patterns showing the postponement of marriage, regardless of whether marriage was preceded by cohabitation, but a less consistent gradient for patterns reflecting long-term cohabitation and union dissolution. Although the US results show evidence of an educational divergence in marriage and union dissolution, the evidence from the other countries is weak. In addition, country context explains more of the variation in class membership than education, with context becoming more important over time. The divergence in behaviors across country contexts suggests that social, cultural, political, and economic developments are essential for understanding changes in partnership formation and dissolution.

Theevidence for these arguments is primarily from the United States, where eco-nomic inequality has been increasing (McLanahan and Percheski 2008), but alsofrom other countries such as Australia and New Zealand (Heard 2011). Whileevidence from some countries in Europe indicates that the educational gradientfor having a birth within cohabitation is negative (Perelli-Harris et al. 2010), theevidence for union trajectories as a whole is scant. Indeed, the associationbetween education and analyses of individual events (e.g., divorce, marriage,and cohabitation) differs across countries and over time (Härkönen andDronkers 2006; Kalmijn 2013; Matysiak, Styrc, and Vignoli 2013; Neels andPerelli-Harris 2013). Thus, it is not clear that the association between patternsof partnership formation and education is universal or can be generalized toother industrialized countries.In addition, levels of union formation and dissolution have not been increas-ing uniformly across countries and instead appear to be diverging (Billari andLiefbroer 2010). The proportion that has ever married is higher in SouthernEurope than in Northern Europe, while the proportion that has ever cohabitedis higher in Northern Europe compared to Southern Europe (Neels and Perelli-Harris 2013; Sobotka and Toulemon 2008). The median age at marriage variesfrom around 22 in parts of Eastern Europe to over 31 in Northern Europe(Billari and Liefbroer 2010). The percentage of women who ever experiencedunion dissolution ranges from less than 10 percent in Southern and someEastern European countries to over 40 percent in Norway and the United States(Galezewska, Perelli-Harris, and Berrington 2013). This divergence in behaviorsacross countries suggests that the social, cultural, political, and economic con-text is essential for understanding changes in partnership formation anddissolution.Thus, although an individual’s education may be key to understandingchanges in certain aspects of union formation or in certain countries, it isnot clear that trajectories are diverging by education everywhere. In thispaper, we examine the following main research questions: How do the edu-cational gradients for patterns of partnership formation differ acrossEurope and the United States and over time? Are certain partnership pat-terns more likely to be consistently associated with education than others?In addition, country of residence appears to be very salient for understand-ing new developments in union formation. Thus, we also investigate to whatextent both country context and individual-level education play a role inunion formation.To answer these questions, we study the association between women’s educa-tion and holistic partnership trajectories using latent class growth models(LCGM). Most studies of union formation and education model only singleevents, which show the association with a particular type of union behavior, butdo not show how education is associated with partnership trajectories as a252 Social Forces 95(1)whole. Given that partnership behavior has become much more complex andde-standardized, with individuals experiencing cohabitation, union dissolu-tion, and multiple partnerships (Perelli-Harris and Lyons-Amos 2015; Elizingaand Liefbroer 2007), studying a single event at a time does not show the totalassociation between education and partnership behavior across the lifecourse.Thus, it is necessary to examine holistic partnership trajectories to show howeducation is associated with partnership formation and dissolution across thelifecourse.This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, by using latentclass growth models, it presents an innovative way of modeling partnership for-mation by simultaneously examining the timing, sequencing, and quantum ofevents. Although previous studies in demography have used this method (e.g.,Dariotis et al. 2011), they have rarely been used for comparing family formationacross multiple countries and with large datasets. Second, the study examines towhat extent the association between partnership patterns and education is simi-lar across countries. These ﬁndings contrast the United States with Europe andprovide insights into whether the underlying reasons for family change are uni-versal. Third, the study assesses the relative contribution of education and coun-try to the probability of membership in a given class. This provides evidence forthe role of both individual-level education and country-speciﬁc context.Theoretical FrameworkEducation and Partnership PatternsWith the decline in marriage and rise in divorce throughout the 1970s and1980s, economic and ideational theories posited that the increase in women’seducation was responsible for the spread of new behaviors (Becker 1991; van deKaa 1987; Lesthaeghe 2010). Highly educated women’s economic independenceallowed them to live outside marriage and divorce if they did marry (Becker1991). Now oriented toward autonomy and career, more educated womenrejected the patriarchal institution of marriage in favor of more ﬂexible arrange-ments such as cohabitation. If they did marry, their opposition to traditionalinstitutions such as the Church would lead them to be more likely to divorce andrepartner in cohabiting unions (Lesthaeghe 2010).Several recent explanations, however, have tended to stress that women’shigher education is beneﬁcial to marriage and protects against divorce(Oppenheimer 1988; Oppenheimer 1997; Goldstein and Kenney 2001; Sweeney2002; McLanahan 2004; Cherlin 2009; Perelli-Harris et al. 2010). Higher edu-cated women may postpone marriage, but as their economic potential becomesmore similar to men’s, they become more attractive to prospective spouses,which results in higher marriage rates compared to their less educated counter-parts (Oppenheimer 1997; Sweeney 2002; Goldstein and Kenney 2001). In addi-tion, the resources that highly educated women bring to the union reduce riskPartnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 253and stabilize marriage, resulting in lower divorce rates (Oppenheimer 1997;Matysiak, Styrc, and Vignoli 2013).Many of these shifts have been the result of widespread social and economicdevelopments that have altered the institution of marriage, thereby facilitatingthe gains to marriage for highly educated women (Cherlin 2009; Stevenson andWolfers 2007). In many industrialized countries, marriage now appears to beshifting away from a dependent, patriarchal relationship toward a more egalitar-ian partnership with both partners contributing to the relationship (Heard 2011;Kalmijn 2013). Changes in lifestyles have led marriage to be advantageous forthose who complement each other, rather than those who specialize in differentdomains (Stevenson and Wolfers 2007). In addition, new labor-market demandsand middle-class aspirations have resulted in many choosing a dual-earnermodel, which often beneﬁts those with greater economic potential. Having ahigher shared income allows the couple to maintain a higher standard of livingand protect against unemployment or illness, resulting in increased relationshipstability.In the United States, the emerging positive educational gradient of marriage(Isen and Stevenson 2010) has led some researchers to claim that marriage isbecoming a status symbol reserved for the economic elite (Cherlin 2009).Increases in income inequality have made it even more difﬁcult for low-educatedcouples to achieve the standard of living perceived necessary for marriage(McLanahan and Percheski 2008). Qualitative studies from the United Statesalso indicate that low-income couples would like to marry, but often lack theﬁnancial stability to do so (Reed 2006; Gibson-Davis 2007; Smock, Manning,and Porter 2005). In addition, low-income couples who do marry face a greaterrisk of divorce, due to strains brought about by employment instability and jobloss (Edin and Kefalas 2005).The corollary to this argument is that in places with a high economic bar formarriage, couples who are not ready or able to marry live in cohabitation.Couples with weak economic prospects—usually the least educated—are mostlikely to cohabit (Oppenheimer 2003; Kalmijn 2011). Studies from the UnitedStates show that the least educated do not have the ﬁnancial or emotionalresources to convert their cohabiting relationships into marriage, and insteadﬁnd themselves cohabiting or cycling through multiple partnerships (Kennedyand Bumpass 2008; Lichter, Turner, and Sassler 2010). Thus, even though cou-ples of all educational levels increasingly begin their relationships with cohabita-tion, as relationships progress and individuals reach later adulthood, the morehighly educated are most likely to marry. This results in a negative educationalgradient for cohabitation, especially by the time of the ﬁrst birth (Perelli-Harriset al. 2010). In addition, given that cohabiting unions are more likely to dissolve(Heuveline, Timberlake, and Furstenberg 2003; Galezewska, Perelli-Harris, andBerrington 2013), the least educated are more likely to experience the dissolu-tion not only of their marriages, but also of their cohabiting unions.Although a great body of literature in the United States provides evidence fora positive educational gradient for marriage and a negative educational gradientfor cohabitation and divorce (see McLanahan and Percheski 2008; Carlson and254 Social Forces 95(1)England 2011), the ﬁndings in Europe are more inconsistent and depend on typeof transition, time period analyzed, and method of measurement. In most coun-tries, higher education leads to the postponement of marriage (Goldstein andKenney 2001; Coppola 2004; Kalmijn 2007), and the increase in the age at mar-riage is correlated with the expansion of education (Sobotka and Toulemon2008). The association with ever marrying or staying married, however, is lessconsistent (Kalmijn 2013). The educational gradient for the percent of womenwho have ever cohabited is mixed (Neels and Perelli-Harris 2013) and maydepend on the point in the lifecourse analyzed (Mikolai, Perelli-Harris, andBerrington 2014). Thus, it is unclear whether the educational gradient forcohabitation and the transition to marriage is consistent across the lifecourse.Likewise, the evidence for the relationship between education and divorce ismixed. In the United States, the educational gradient of divorce has reversedfrom positive to negative (Martin 2006). In Europe, the educational gradient fordivorce appears to switch as the prevalence of divorce increases; the gradient ispositive in countries where divorce has just begun to emerge and negative incountries where divorce is more common (Härkönen and Dronkers 2006;Matysiak, Styrc, and Vignoli 2013). This reversal may be due to changes in thecosts of divorce: when the social and economic costs of divorce are high, onlyhighly educated women have the resources to divorce, but when the costsdecline, the least educated may be more likely to divorce (Härkönen andDronkers 2006). Nonetheless, it is unclear whether this reversal occurs every-where, especially given the lack of a strong relationship between education anddivorce in some countries.Country Context and Partnership PatternsAlthough social and economic change may be leading to different partnershiptrajectories by education, the role of country has also been found to be one ofthe most enduring factors shaping family formation. Numerous studies havefound that countries, or states deﬁned by national borders, have been importantfor deﬁning demographic processes across space (e.g., Klüsener, Perelli-Harris,and Sánchez Gassen 2013; Coale and Watkins 1986). By developing standardpolicies, education, communication, and media, the modern state has organizedand structured populations, resulting in greater homogenization of behaviorswithin countries (Watkins 1991). Country borders continue to be important fordeﬁning behaviors, such as levels of nonmarital fertility (Klüsener, Perelli-Harris, and Sánchez Gassen 2013). Countries delineate the space in which peo-ple are exposed to economic, social, political, and cultural factors, which in turninﬂuence individual behaviors that aggregate to population-level behavior.Social change also does not happen randomly in space, but is generally con-centrated within the borders of countries. Within countries, underlying culturalpropensities and historical kinship systems (Reher 1998) coupled with socialand political developments led to the diffusion of new ideas and the practice ofnew behaviors (Lesthaeghe and Neels 2002). Some populations adopt new beha-viors quickly, while others maintain traditional behaviors for decades. ForPartnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 255example, cohabitation and divorce have only recently started to increase inSouthern Europe, due to the persistence of “strong family ties” (Reher 1998).Catholicism has slowed the diffusion of cohabitation and divorce in Italy,Poland, and Lithuania (Vignoli and Salvini 2014; Mynarska and Bernardi 2007;Katus et al. 2007). On the other hand, Protestantism may have promoted liberalvalues in countries such as Estonia (Katus et al. 2007) and other Nordic coun-tries. In general, the Nordic countries experienced an earlier orientation towardgender equality and female participation in the labor force (Bernhardt, Noack,and Lyngstad 2008), which facilitated women’s independence and potentiallyled to the increase in cohabitation and divorce. However, much of WesternGermany also has Protestant roots and cohabitation has continued to remainlow, due to a persistent conservative orientation toward motherhood and thebreadwinner model (Konietzka and Kreyenfeld 2002). Thus, the factors inﬂu-encing family behavior and facilitating changes in family behavior cannot bedecanted down to one factor, but instead are multifaceted and complex.In addition, globalized processes of change may interact with local conditionsto produce speciﬁc effects. Although the emergence of feminism and individuali-zation may have been important for liberalizing attitudes across countries, glob-alization of labor markets throughout the 1980s and 1990s may have produceduncertainty that led to postponed marriage or temporary relationships (Millsand Blossfeld 2005; Perelli-Harris et al. 2010). Yet, the impact of uncertaintymay have different effects on union formation in different countries. For exam-ple, youth unemployment and temporary employment have been linked to thepostponement of marriage with low premarital cohabitation in Spain (Castro-Martin, Domínguez-Folgueras, and Martín-García 2008), while economicuncertainty has been associated with higher levels of cohabitation and nonmari-tal fertility in Eastern Germany (Konietzka and Kreyenfeld 2002). Economicinsecurity also interacted with rapid social change in the post-socialist world, forexample, by producing a pattern of disadvantage for childbearing in cohabita-tion in Russia (Perelli-Harris and Gerber 2011). Thus, ideational change coupledwith changes in economic conditions has led to new patterns of union formationbehavior and raised questions about whether previous theories of marriage areadequate for explaining these new developments.Along with cultural and economic developments, policies and legal systemsare also important for understanding the variation in partnership behaviorsacross countries. Historical and cultural developments led to variation in therights and responsibilities provided to married and cohabiting couples, whichmay in turn be related to the choices couples make about whether to marry ordivorce (Perelli-Harris and Sánchez Gassen 2012). For example, the enactmentof divorce laws, especially those that allowed divorce without the consent ofone’s spouse, led to short-term increases in divorce, although these increasesmay have been the result of pent-up demand rather than long-term effect (Kneipand Bauer 2009). Nonetheless, divorce laws can reﬂect and reinforce cross-national differentials in divorce. Likewise, laws on cohabitation and marriagediffer considerably across Europe; some countries, such as the Netherlands andNorway, have equalized many laws on cohabitation and marriage, while others,256 Social Forces 95(1)such as Germany, Switzerland, Lithuania, and Russia, continue to maintain dis-tinctions between marriage and cohabitation, especially in tax law (Perelli-Harrisand Sánchez Gassen 2012; Sánchez Gassen and Perelli-Harris 2015). Differentlegal regimes may shape choices about marriage and cohabitation, although thecorrelation is far from perfect (Sánchez Gassen and Perelli-Harris 2015).Finally, certain factors may mediate the relationship between education andunion formation. The diffusion of a behavior may result in the reversal of theeducational gradient, as seen with divorce (Matysiak, Styrc, and Vignoli 2013;Härkönen and Dronkers 2006). The development of new values such as genderequality in some countries may be associated with a positive educational gradientfor marriage (Kalmijn 2013). Nonetheless, while gender equality may be impor-tant for inﬂuencing the educational gradient of marriage, we do not knowwhether an individual’s education or country context matters more for determin-ing overall trajectories of union formation. Given the persistent and dynamiceffects of culture, economic conditions, and policy context, as well as the effects ofindividual-level education on speciﬁc partnership transitions, it is important toexamine the relative contribution of one’s own education and country context.DataTo answer our two main research questions, we analyze retrospective union andfertility histories from 15 surveys that have been standardized in a dataset calledthe Harmonized Histories (Perelli-Harris, Kreyenfeld, and Kubisch 2010;and see www.nonmarital.org). We focus on women, because the union historiesfor men are not available in all countries. The data for Austria, Belgium,Bulgaria, Estonia, France, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Romania, and Russia comefrom the Generations and Gender Surveys (GGS), which interviewed nationallyrepresentative samples of the resident population in each country. These surveysbroadly reﬂect vital registration indicators for marriage (Vergauwen et al.2015). Because the GGS is not available for all countries, we also employedother data sources. The Dutch data come from the 2003 Fertility and FamilySurvey (FFS). The data for the UK are from the British Household Panel Survey(BHPS). The Spanish data come from the Survey of Fertility and Values con-ducted in 2006, and the Polish data are from the Employment, Family, andEducation survey conducted in 2006. The US data are from two rounds of theNational Survey of Family Growth, conducted in 1995 and between 2006 and2008. Table 1 shows the number of women aged 15–45 in each survey by educa-tion and cohort for the analysis sample.Despite slightly different survey designs, the union histories are relativelycomparable. Our data include the month of entrance into cohabiting and maritalunions as well as separation and divorce. Questions about cohabitation gener-ally refer to co-resident relationships with an intimate partner that last morethan three months. Our analysis examines the relationship states that occurbetween the ages of 15 and 45. However, because most of our surveys inter-viewed women who were older than 45 at the time of the survey, we comparewomen born in 1945–54, 1955–64, and 1965–74.

In the US NSFG, only women up to age 44 were interviewed;thus, the 1995 NSFG allows us to examine only the 1951–54 cohorts, while the2006–08 NSFG allows us to examine the 1955–64 and 1965–74 cohorts.Although the Harmonized Histories surveys are relatively comparable, eachsurvey’s sampling strategy and response rates differ, which can have differentimplications for the creation of the latent classes. Some surveys do not requireweights (for example, Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania), while some surveysinclude sample weights at the individual level (Austria, France, US), or both thehousehold and individual level (UK). Since our inference regards individual-levelbehaviors, we apply the individual-level weights where relevant. Where unavail-able, we use a constant as the individual-level weight. In addition, some surveys(i.e., Italy) have very large samples, which may dominate the results in a pooleddataset. To analyze the pooled dataset, we have transformed the weightingschemes to retain their internal consistency, but also provide meaningful cross-national solutions. To create a sample with each survey equally represented, werescale the weighted population totals so that each survey contributes the sameproportion to the total sample. This approach allows the internal validity of thesurveys to be maintained (all the weights are adjusted), but ensures that no onesurvey dominates the sample.Table 1. continuedBirth cohortCountryEducationallevel 1945–54 1955–64 1965–74Russia GGS Low 8.6 (99) 2.3 (33) 3.3 (35)Medium 68.9 (792) 75.6 (1031) 73.1 (747)High 22.3 (257) 22.0 (302) 23.5 (239)Spain SFS Low 75.8 (723) 53.7 (716) 37.2 (506)Medium 15.9 (152) 29.0 (390) 39.9 (551)High 8.1 (78) 17.2 (230) 22.8 (318)UK BHPS Low 26.3 (201) 12.1 (105) 6.2 (56)Medium 15.9 (239) 34.9 (304) 37.7 (341)High 42.3 (323) 52.9 (460) 56.0 (551)US NSFG Low 12.9 (211b) 12.5 (496b) 16.5 (317c)Medium 37.5 (612b) 40.8 (1596b) 26.0 (495c)High 49.5 (809b) 46.6 (1832b) 57.3 (1094c)aHistories were not collected for the 1945–54 birth cohort in the Austrian GGS and the 1945–54and 1955–64 birth cohorts in the Poland EFES.bData are from 1995 National Survey of Family Growth and refer to the 1951–54 cohorts.cData are from the 2006–08 National Survey of Family Growth and refer to the 1955–64 and1965–74 cohorts.Partnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 259MethodsWe use a two-stage process to answer our two main research questions: 1) Weanswer the ﬁrst research question by using latent classes as the dependent vari-able in a multinomial logit model with education and country included asexplanatory variables. 2) We answer the second research question by showingthe relative contribution of education compared to country context in inﬂuenc-ing the probability of latent class membership.LCGM ModelsLatent class growth curve models (LCGM), which are the dependent variable inour analyses, trace partnership patterns for each individual and then cluster thepatterns into latent classes.1 To create the growth curves, we ﬁrst expand thedata into person-years.2 We then ﬁt separate trajectories for each union status:never in union, cohabiting, directly married, married having previously cohab-ited, and single after being in a previous union.3 We distinguish between directlymarrying and marrying after cohabiting to show how entrance into marriagechanges over time. This approach reveals to what extent cohabitation is emerg-ing as a precursor to marriage or as a long-term relationship that lasts until therespondent is 45.The response variable for the model is deﬁned as the random variable yi,which is deﬁned at each year of the respondent’s partnership history.⎧⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩⎪⎪⎪=y sNever in a unionCohabitingMarried preceded by coabitationDirectly marriedSingle after separation01234i age,Respondents switch between these different states as they move along the life-course from ages 15 to 45. A respondent can move between these mutuallyexclusive states; for example, if she marries at age 20, divorces at 25, cohabits at28, and then remarries at 30, she would be in the states never in union, directlymarried, single after being in a previous union, cohabiting, and married havingpreviously cohabited. We were unable to model higher-order partnershipsdirectly due to small sample size that distorted the LCGM results. If two of thesepartnerships are present within the same year, the higher-value state is selected(for example, if cohabitation transitions to marriage in the same year, the year isclassiﬁed as =y 2ij rather than 1). In certain circumstances, the selection of high-er states will lead to the truncation of a relationship, for instance if a relationshipstarts during the same year as a separation. In order to avoid missing relation-ships, we overwrite years classiﬁed as separation with the new relationship sta-tus, although again these relationships may be truncated. As a result, periods ofseparation lasting less than one year could be missed. However, sensitivity260 Social Forces 95(1)analyses comparing multiple approaches show that the underestimation doesnot bias our results.We then use Mplus (Muthén and Muthén 2011) to calculate growthequations that describe different trajectories. Trajectories are combined to formeach latent class, which describe different partnership patterns across the life-course. Each woman has a probability of being in each latent class; the moreclosely her observed partnership history is to the class trajectories, the higher theprobability of class membership. The probability of being in partnership s at agiven age is deﬁned as π = ( = )Pr y sis i age, (see Equation 1). i indexes the individ-ual woman. The probability of partnerships across the lifecourse is modeled as agrowth equation, where yi age, is a function of age and age2.4 A separate growthequation is speciﬁed for each classCj, where j indexes the class and there are 1…Jclasses.

All three of these parametersvary depending on membership in a particular class. In Equation 1, the trajecto-ries differ only according to class membership,Cj.5We use the Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR-LRT; Lo,Mendell, and Rubin 2001) to determine the number of classes (Nylund,Asparouhov, and Muthén 2007). The LMR-LRT is similar to conventional like-lihood ratio tests that interpret p-values below a certain threshold as indicativeof an improvement in model ﬁt, where the p-value is adjusted to reﬂect the factthat the likelihood does not follow a chi-square distribution.6 The LMR-LRTp-values indicate that eight classes optimally ﬁt the pooled data; the addition ofan eighth class improves model ﬁt at the 1 percent level (LMR p-value is below0.01), but the addition of a ninth class is not signiﬁcant.7Figure 1 shows the eight latent class trajectories extracted from the model.The area under the curve represents the probability of being in a relationshipstate at a given age between the ages of 15 and 45. The solid line shows theprobability of being never partnered; the dash-dot-dash line represents the prob-ability of being in cohabitation that does not transition to marriage beforeage 45; the small dotted line represents the probability of having a direct mar-riage; the medium dashed line represents the probability of being in a marriagethat was preceded by cohabitation; and the gray dashed line represents the prob-ability of being single after having separated from a previous relationship.Women can transfer between states at any point; for example, a woman may benever married, then directly marry, spend some time single after marital dissolu-tion, and then transfer back into cohabitation or marriage for higher-orderPartnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 261Figure 1. Latent classes based on models of growth trajectories262 Social Forces 95(1)unions. Repartnering is incorporated into cohabitation, premarital cohabitation,or marriage lines.8The classes and their sensitivity to robustness checks have been discussed indetail in Perelli-Harris and Lyons-Amos (2015); therefore, we only brieﬂydescribe them here. The ﬁrst four classes primarily reﬂect marriages unlikely toend in separation by age 45: classes 1 and 2 include only direct marriage, whileclasses 3 and 4 reﬂect marriage preceded by cohabitation. Classes 1 and 3 showpatterns of marriage that occur relatively early—the marriage trajectory starts toincrease in the teens and peaks by age 25. Classes 2 and 4, on the other hand,reﬂect later marriage; in class 2, direct marriage starts shortly after age 20 andpeaks in the late 20s, while in class 4, cohabitation peaks in the mid-20s, withmarriage following in the late 20s. Class 5 reﬂects delayed partnership forma-tion, with a strong increase in cohabitation occurring after age 30, some mar-riage in the late 30s, as well as those people who were unlikely to experiencepartnerships before age 45.Classes 6 and 7 reﬂect partnership patterns dominated by separation andrepartnering. Class 6 shows a strong increase in direct marriage in the 20s thatpeaks around age 25 and a gradual increase in being single after separation untilover 60 percent of women are predicted to be single after separation. Some ofthe women in this class reentered cohabitation or marriage in their 30s. Class 7starts out with cohabitation followed by marriage, but the class is dominated bya strong trend in single after separation. Although the probability of direct mar-riage is low, the majority of women in this class are expected to remain singleafter separation into their 30s and 40s. Finally, class 8 is characterized by cohab-itation with a small uptick in being single after separated. Note that the cohab-itation class is not identical to the marriage classes, since it shows astrong decline in cohabitation in the 30s, due to transitions into marriage ordissolution.Multinomial Regression ModelOnce we have created the latent classes, we allocate respondents to a class basedon their posterior probability of class membership and estimate multinomialregression models in Stata SE 12.9 It is unlikely that women would be misallo-cated in our analysis, as the classes extracted in our models show excellent deﬁ-nition based on the class mean posterior membership probability (the lowest is0.959 for classes 6 and 7). This is expressed as a random variable, ji, where theprobability of class membership for individual i is π = ( = )C jPrij J .We then applythe following multinomial regression model (Equation 2):⎛⎝⎜⎜⎞⎠⎟⎟ππ β= ′ = { … } ( )= j Jxln 1 2ijij j i1In this model, xi is a vector of dummy variables of individual characteristics(education, birth cohort, and country) and βj is a set of coefﬁcients measuringtheir effect on class membership.Partnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 263As discussed above, our main variable of interest is individual’s level of edu-cation, speciﬁed as three categories standardized across countries. Each surveyincludes a six-category measure of highest level of education attained by inter-view based on the International Standardized Classiﬁcation of Education(ISCED 1997). We collapsed these categories into three basic categories:low (ISCED 1 & 2—completed basic secondary), medium (ISCED 3 & 4—completed secondary school and any education beyond secondary educationbut less than completed college [including vocational and technical schools]),and high (ISCED 5 & 6—university degree and higher). We recognize that theseeducational categories are crude and have context-speciﬁc meanings, but givendata limitations, they are optimal for comparisons across a large number ofcountries. Note that the distribution of respondents by education differs acrosscountries, with some countries having a much higher proportion of womenwith higher education than others (table 1). However, because our intent is tocompare the educational distribution within countries rather than across coun-tries, these differences are less important.The multinomial model predicts class membership based on education, birthcohort, and country. We interact educational level with country and birth cohortto produce educational gradients for each national setting and measure changein these gradients over time. The models are then used to generate predictedprobabilities, associated standard errors, and prediction intervals. Because edu-cational gradients are unlikely to be linear, we assess gradients based on a signif-icant difference between proportions using a two-tailed t-test.Relative Contribution of Education and CountryOur second research question assesses the relative contribution of individual-level education and country to the probability of falling in a given latent class.The multinomial logistic regression model can be used to predict the probabilityof class membership; however, because education, cohort, and country are inter-acted with each other, the resulting complexity of the beta coefﬁcients makes itdifﬁcult to assess whether education or country is the largest contributor to vari-ation in predicted probabilities. While we could incorporate a multilevel model-ing strategy, with individual-level effects (education) nested within context(country), this method is unsuitable. First, the speciﬁcation of country as a ran-dom effect is methodologically questionable, because the multilevel modelassumes that higher-level units are exchangeable, which our countries are not(Hox, van de Schoot, and Matthijsse 2012). In addition, the number of countriesin our dataset is too low for an interpretation of the random component (Hox,van de Schoot, and Matthijsse 2012; Bryan and Jenkins 2016). Second, sinceour analysis does not include macro-level data, there is no advantage to using amultilevel model. Third, the speciﬁcation of education as a ﬁxed coefﬁcient andcountry as a random effect in a multilevel model means that it is difﬁcult tomake direct comparisons between the two.We therefore perform a series of ANOVA tests to determine which factor bet-ter explains variability in class membership. A higher proportion of variance264 Social Forces 95(1)(deﬁned as partial sum of squares as a proportion of total sum of squares)explained by a factor in the ANOVA indicates a greater contribution to varia-tion in predicted probabilities. ANOVAs are performed on the predicted prob-abilities of class membership for each latent class generated from the predictivemodel described in Equation 2. ANOVA tests make the assumption that theresponse variable is normally distributed; thus, we transform the predictedprobabilities (which are non-normal).10 We perform the analysis by birthcohort to detect whether there is a change in the contribution of an individual’seducation or country to the latent class, although we do not perform formaltests to determine whether the change over time is signiﬁcant.ResultsEducation and Partnership PatternsAs discussed above, the ﬁrst aim is to determine whether the eight latent classesare signiﬁcantly associated with an individual’s level of education. We run multi-nomial models with the eight classes as the dependent variable and education,country, and cohort as predictor variables. Tables 2a and 2b show the predictedprobability of falling into each latent class by education, country, and cohort.The shaded results indicate a signiﬁcant difference between high and medium orlow and medium education (.05 level based on a two-tailed t-test). Light grayindicates that the educational gradient is negative; black indicates the educa-tional gradient is positive; and medium gray indicates the gradient is U-shaped.Higher education is associated with delayed marriage classes, regardless ofpremarital cohabitation. Table 2a shows the probability of falling into the fourstable marriage pattern classes. Immediately we can see that in most countries,the two early marriage patterns (classes 1 and 3) are dominated by light graysquares that indicate a negative educational gradient, while the two later mar-riage patterns (classes 2 and 4) are dominated by black squares that indicate apositive educational gradient. Note, however, that the negative educational gra-dient is sometimes associated with a signiﬁcant difference between the higherand medium educated, and sometimes between medium and low. In addition,the results are not completely consistent across all countries; some countriesshow a U-shaped educational gradient, and some have a positive educationalgradient for the early marriage class, due to the least educated being in thecohabitation or dissolution classes. Despite these nuances, the results show thathigher education is related to the postponement of marriage.We also ﬁnd that the relationship between education and marriage timingholds regardless of whether the marriage was preceded by cohabitation; in mostcountries, the least educated have earlier marriage patterns than the more edu-cated, even when they experience premarital cohabitation. The educational gra-dient for delayed marriage preceded by cohabitation is overwhelmingly positive,with the exception of Estonia. The prevalence of this pattern is increasing acrosscohorts in every country, reﬂecting the popularity of premarital cohabitationand the delay of marriage, but not the rejection of marriage.

Thus, education consistently shapes the educational gradi-ent of the timing of marriage, regardless of whether it was preceded bycohabitation.The separation and cohabitation classes show an inconsistent educationalgradient across countries. Table 2b presents the association between educationand partnership patterns that are not centered on long-term stable marriage(classes 5–8). The results for these classes are much more mixed, with inconsis-tent relationships and very few common patterns across countries. Class 5,which represents delayed partnership formation and remaining never partnereduntil age 45, has a mix of positive and negative gradients. Italy and Spain standout as having a high probability of falling into class 5 and strong positiveeducational gradients, due to general delayed union formation and marriage(Castro-Martin, Domínguez-Folgueras, and Martín-García 2008). The positiveeducational gradient has emerged more recently in Austria, Lithuania, theNetherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Spain. Cohorts in some countries,however, have no educational gradient or a U-shaped gradient, as in Bulgariaand the United States. In the UK, the least educated in the youngest cohort havea particularly high probability of falling into class 5, perhaps because of the lowrates of forming co-residential unions.Results for the separation classes (classes 6 and 7) are also mixed. In mostcountries, if the gradient is signiﬁcant it is usually negative, with the exception ofEstonia. Lithuania and Russia have positive gradients for earlier cohorts, butthey too have negative gradients for later cohorts. Italy has a consistently posi-tive educational gradient for class 7, which corroborates previous evidence thatthe emergence of divorce in Italy has been associated with higher education,although note that the predicted probability for this class is very small. The classrepresenting cohabitation (class 8) also has inconsistent educational gradients.Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Russia had positive gradients in theearliest birth cohorts, supporting studies that long-term cohabitation emergedamong the most highly educated, especially in the Low Countries and France.However, only Austria has a positive educational gradient for the youngestcohort. In Bulgaria, Lithuania, Romania, and the United States, the educationalgradient for the most recent cohort is negative. Note that the educational gradi-ent for long-term cohabitation is consistently negative in the United States, sup-porting other ﬁndings (Kennedy and Bumpass 2008).Divergence by Education for Marriage and Separation?Taken as a whole, table 2a indicates that women with lower education have asigniﬁcantly higher probability of falling in the earlier marriage classes (classes 1and 3), while highly educated women are more likely to be in later marriage clas-ses (2 and 4). However, it is difﬁcult to know from table 2a whether more or lesseducated women are more likely to enter and stay in stable marriages through-out the reproductive ages, as discussed in the theoretical framework. In addition,it is difﬁcult to know from 2b whether women with higher education are270 Social Forces 95(1)diverging from women with lower education with respect to separation aftereither cohabitation or marriage. In order to answer these questions, we also showtable 3, which combines the results from classes 1–4 and classes 6–7 and speciﬁ-cally looks for differences between high and low education.Table 3 shows that throughout much of Western and Northern Europe andthe United States, the educational gradient for staying in marriage throughoutthe reproductive period is signiﬁcantly positive, supporting the recent ﬁndingsthat marriage is now more likely for the highly educated. This is the case in thelatest cohorts in France, Lithuania, Norway, the UK, and the United States.Nonetheless, there is no signiﬁcant relationship between education and stayingin marriage in Central and Eastern European countries. In some countries, suchas Poland and Romania, the lack of relationship is probably due to a highprobability of all women entering and staying in marriage, while in Russia,women are more likely to be in classes with union dissolution, and in Estonia,women are more likely to be in long-term cohabitation. On the other hand, inSouthern Europe, the gradient for the marriage class tends to be negative, pri-marily because the most highly educated delay union formation until their late30s and early 40s, as represented by class 5.However, for the separation classes, when the educational gradient is signiﬁ-cant, it is consistently negative: in the most recent cohorts in Austria, France,Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the United States, the lower edu-cated have a signiﬁcantly higher probability of falling into a marital dissolutionor separation class than the higher educated. These results might suggest that thehigher and lower educated have signiﬁcantly different partnership trajectories.However, only France, Lithuania, and the United States show a positive gradientfor the marriage classes and a negative gradient for the separation classes, indi-cating that the relationship is not uniform within countries. Hence, while theresults for the United States, France, and Lithuania indicate that patterns ofunion formation and dissolution appear to be diverging by education, this trenddoes not seem to be occurring to the same degree in the other countries.Country Context and Individual’s EducationWe then turn to our second research question, which uses ANOVA to assess therelative importance of micro-level education and macro-level country contextfor each latent class by cohort (table 4). Each analysis presents the relative shareof the variation in the predicted probabilities for that class explained by educa-tion and country, as well as the proportion remaining unexplained.In the latent class for early, direct marriage (class 1), education was initiallyvery important—it explained almost half of the variation in predicted probabili-ties for the 1945–54 cohort. In later cohorts, however, the relative importanceof education declined to explain only about 10 percent of the variation in pre-dicted probabilities. In contrast, cross-national variation increased in importancefrom explaining just under a quarter of the variation in the 1945–54 cohorts tonearly 80 percent in the 1965–74 cohorts. The percent of unexplained variancealso declined across the cohorts, indicating that education and country contextPartnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 271Table 3.

Although ourtests cannot show whether the change across cohorts is signiﬁcant, the magni-tude of the difference suggests that in the earliest birth cohorts, education was amore dominant factor than country context. Then, as countries started to experi-ence increases in educational attainment and delays in marriage at differentrates, country setting became more important.The pattern is similar in the later direct marriage class (class 2), except thatthe role of education was less pronounced over the three cohorts and cross-national variation was always dominant. In class 3, the class representing earlymarriage preceded by cohabitation, country was the dominant factor for allcohorts. However, in this class, the role of education was minimal: educationexplained less than 8 percent of the variation in all cohorts and between 9 andTable 4.

In contrast, educational attain-ment explained a greater proportion of the variance in class 4, which representspostponed marriage preceded by cohabitation. However, the proportionexplained by education declined, and as in the other classes, country becameincreasingly important. Again, education and country explained nearly all of thevariation, with only 5 percent left unexplained for the latest cohort.In class 5, representing late union formation and never partnering, educationinitially accounted for roughly one-quarter of the total variation in predictedprobabilities. Thereafter, the relative importance of education declined, whilethe proportion of variance explained by country increased. Note that the pro-portion of variance explained by education in the 1965–74 birth cohorts washigher in class 5 than in any other class. Therefore, although the relative impor-tance of education compared to national setting declined (as for classes 1, 2,and 4), education was still relatively important for delayed union formation.Also, this class had a high proportion of unexplained variance, suggesting thatfactors other than country and education were important.For classes 6 and 7, which characterize union dissolution patterns, educationis of limited importance in all cohorts, accounting for less than 2 percent of vari-ance. This supports the above ﬁnding that marital dissolution and separationpatterns are less likely to be associated with educational attainment, and thatcountry context is far more important for explaining separation. Note as wellthat country context is so important for predicting marital dissolution or separa-tion patterns that the proportion of unexplained variance is strikingly low—lessthan 6 percent for both classes. In class 8 (long-term cohabitation), education isonly marginally important, accounting for less than 5 percent of variation in thepredicted probability. In contrast, the proportion of variance explained by coun-try increased by roughly 20 percentage points over the cohorts. While unex-plained variance was relatively high in the earlier cohorts, less than 10 percentof variation was unexplained for the 1965–74 cohort. These results indicate thateducational level is only marginally inﬂuential in explaining long-term cohabit-ing behavior, but country setting is becoming increasingly important.DiscussionRecent studies in the United States and Europe have argued that the more highlyeducated are increasingly following a trajectory characterized by delayed butstable marriage, while the least educated are following a trajectory includingcohabitation and union instability (Isen and Stevenson 2010; Cherlin 2009;Martin 2006; Perelli-Harris et al. 2010; McLanahan 2004). No study, however,has examined this argument with holistic partnership trajectories between ages15 and 45 using cohabitation and marriage histories. Our approach allows us toexamine the complexity of relationship transitions across the lifecourse by simul-taneously investigating the timing and type of partnership formation, as well asunion dissolution and repartnering (see Perelli-Harris and Lyons-Amos 2015).Given that partnership transitions are often interdependent, tracing partnershipstatus throughout adulthood allows us to better understand how education is274 Social Forces 95(1)related to a range of processes rather than just a single event. The results fromour ﬁrst analyses provide some support for the diverging trajectories argument:higher education is important for understanding the timing and prevalence ofstable marriage patterns in the majority of our studied countries, and in somecountries partnership patterns with union dissolution were associated withlower education. However, the results from the second analysis reveal that awoman’s education is less relevant for predicting partnership patterns than thecountry in which she is living, which suggests that context may be more impor-tant than individual-level characteristics.Previous studies have indicated that union formation behaviors have beendiverging across Europe and the United States (Billari and Liefbroer 2010), sug-gesting that social and cultural change has been occurring at different rates andproducing diverse patterns of union formation. Here, we ﬁnd that macro-levelcountry context explains more of the variance in predicted probabilities thanindividual-level education and is an excellent predictor of partnership patternsas a whole. While education may be important for understanding the timing ofmarriage or the delay of union formation at the individual level, it is not themain predictor of partnership patterns in any latent class except the early mar-riage class. In fact, the importance of country context appears to be increasingover time, suggesting a growing inﬂuence of social, cultural, and economic fac-tors on women’s partnership behavior. This increasing divergence is occurringdespite the expansion of educational attainment in all countries, an expansionthat produces greater within-country heterogeneity and should provide a greateropportunity for education to become more inﬂuential as lower educationbecomes more selective of certain groups. Thus, our ﬁndings show that eventhough women’s education has increased everywhere and should be producinggreater differentials in partnership behavior, country of residence has becomemore important for characterizing partnership behavior.Note, however, that it is impossible to completely disentangle the effect of edu-cation on the individual level from macro-level country context; country contextdoes reﬂect the aggregate level of education in a country. The increase in educa-tion at the macro level may be driving social and cultural change and producingdifferences in partnership formation across countries. For example, the greaterpercent of women who attained higher education in the Scandinavian countriesmay be leading to a faster pace of delayed marriage and increased cohabitationthan in Eastern European countries, where higher education has not expanded asquickly. Nonetheless, our results indicate that the within-country variation in edu-cation is less important for partnership patterns than the between-country varia-tion of country context as a whole. For example, the ﬁndings suggest that thepartnership pattern of a highly educated Norwegian is more similar to that of aless educated Norwegian than a highly educated Romanian.This is not say, however, that an individual’s level of education is not impor-tant for understanding union formation, particularly the timing of marriage.Overall, the two early marriage classes were dominated by negative educationalgradients, while the two later marriage classes were dominated by positivegradients, suggesting that highly educated women are more likely to delayPartnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 275marriage in pursuit of other opportunities, such as a career, or may be able toprolong the spousal search process due to their higher economic potential(Oppenheimer 1997). In addition, as higher education has expanded, the pro-portion of women in the early marriage classes has declined, with a greater pro-portion shifting to the later marriage classes, demonstrating how education hasbeen important for delaying marriage. Cohabiting before marriage did not seemto change this relationship: latent classes with premarital cohabitation and earlymarriage usually had negative gradients, while those with premarital cohabita-tion and later marriage had positive gradients. Thus, premarital cohabitation isrelatively inconsequential for understanding the educational gradient of partner-ship formation compared to the stronger and more consistent associationbetween education and the timing of marriage.In addition, education does seem to be associated with patterns of marital sta-bility and union dissolution in some countries, particularly for more recentcohorts. The United States stands out as having a clear long-term divergence inunion formation patterns by education; the stable marriage classes have positiveeducational gradients for all cohorts, while the union dissolution classes havenegative educational gradients for all cohorts. The long-term cohabitation classis also characterized by a persistent negative educational gradient. However, theevidence for a divergence in partnership trajectories in Europe is comparativelyweak. While in most of Northern and Western Europe, women with higher edu-cation have a higher probability of experiencing stable marriage, this associationhas only recently emerged and is not always consistent. Countries in Central andEastern Europe tend to have no signiﬁcant relationship between education andstable marriage classes, most likely because marriage is relatively young and uni-versal, especially in Russia, Poland, and Romania (Hoem et al. 2010). In Italyand Spain, however, the stable marriage classes have a negative educational gra-dient, due to highly educated women having a higher probability of falling intothe delayed partnership class. The educational gradient for the union dissolutionclasses is either negative or insigniﬁcant and has been for all cohorts. Theseresults suggest that when looking at union trajectories as a whole, the educa-tional gradient of union dissolution has not reversed over time, contradictingstudies that examine only the transition to divorce (Härkönen and Dronkers2006; Matysiak, Styrc, and Vignoli 2013).Note that this study has several limitations. The reporting of cohabiting rela-tionships may be subject to recall error, and each survey is subject to limitationsthat may bias results (see Perelli-Harris, Kreyenfeld, and Kubisch 2010). Thenumber and form of the latent classes are sensitive to the speciﬁc countries andcohorts included, and the US 1951–54 cohort is not directly comparable to the1945–54 cohorts in other countries. Due to truncation, the 1965–74 cohortwould not have reached age 45, depending on the year of the survey in eachcountry. This will have reduced the exposure time for these women, possiblyunderestimating their prevalence in the union dissolution classes, or evendelayed marriage classes, and it could also have implications for the educationalgradient. These issues were discussed extensively and tested with sensitivity anal-yses in Perelli-Harris and Lyons-Amos (2015). Finally, the analyses are only276 Social Forces 95(1)descriptive and cannot establish a causal relationship between education andpartnership trajectories. Despite these shortcomings, however, we feel that thebeneﬁts of comparing latent classes across countries and examining the youngestcohort with the available data outweigh these limitations.Indeed, by including the youngest cohorts, we can see how country context isbecoming more relevant across cohorts, as shown in the second analysis.Relative to individual-level education, country increasingly explains more of thevariance in partnership classes over time, or at least does not change substan-tially. Thus, the increasing variation between countries has become more impor-tant for understanding holistic patterns of union formation and dissolution.However, the reason for the divergence in partnership behavior may be becausesome countries are at the forefront of new developments, while others are lag-ging behind (Billari and Liefbroer 2010; Lesthaeghe 2010). As cohabitation andunion dissolution increase in all countries, Europe and the United States mayeventually experience greater convergence. On the other hand, with the increas-ing de-standardization of the lifecourse, convergence may become less likely, aseach country takes its own unique path. Indeed, qualitative research has sug-gested that participants in countries across Europe interpret the meaning ofcohabitation in different ways (Perelli-Harris et al. 2014). Thus, in order tobetter understand these developments, it is important not only to search for com-mon explanations for changes in partnership, but also to examine context-speciﬁc factors. Only in-depth investigation into historical, cultural, economic,and policy developments will lead to a better understanding of how and whypartnership patterns are changing.Notes1. Sequence analysis extracts partnership histories in a similar way but requires assump-tions about missing data and may produce clusters not supported by the data.2. Although person-months may be more accurate, computational limitations requirethe use of yearly intervals. However, robustness tests in individual countriesproduced similar results.3. Women are considered single at time of separation, not divorce. Widows were codedas single after being in a previous union.4. Other speciﬁcations of the underlying distribution did not substantially alter theresults.5. Growth mixture models with random coefﬁcients did not converge with our data.6. Although the bootstrap likelihood ratio test is better for testing the number of classesdue to a lower false positive rate (Nylund, Asparouhov, and Muthén 1997), the testis too computationally intense.7. The number of classes is sensitive to model speciﬁcation; for example, the number ofcountries can change the number of classes. Hence, the eight latent classes are speciﬁcto this model speciﬁcation, and we urge caution in interpreting this exact number(Warren et al. 2014).8. We tried adding a trajectory for second- and higher-order unions, but only three clas-ses emerged, indicating a loss of diversity. Therefore, we speciﬁed that respondentsreenter cohabitation or marriage after separation.Partnership Patterns in the United States and across Europe 2779. We would prefer to estimate the model based on the pseudo-class method usingMplus (Wang, Brown, and Bandeen-Roche 2005; Nylund, Asparouhov, andMuthén 2007), but this approach was too computationally intensive.10. We tested ANOVA results with both logit and square-root arcsine links, but due tosimilar results, we only present logit links.About the AuthorsBrienna Perelli-Harris is Associate Professor of Demography at the University ofSouthampton.
