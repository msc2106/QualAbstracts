ABSTRACT: 
peer-reviewedEvidence shows that there are individual differences in the extent to which people attend to and integrate information into their decisions about the predictive contingencies between events and outcomes. In particular, information about the absence of events or outcomes, presented outside the current task frame, is often neglected. This trend is particularly evident in depression, as well as other psychopathologies, though reasons for information neglect remain unclear. We investigated this phenomenon across two experiments (Experiment 1: N = 157; Experiment 2: N = 150) in which participants, scoring low and high in the Beck Depression Inventory, were asked to learn a simple predictive relationship between a visual cue and an auditory outcome. We manipulated whether or not participants had prior experience of the visual cue outside of the task frame, whether such experience took place in the same or different context to the learning task, and the nature of the action required to signal occurrence of the auditory outcome. We found that all participants were capable of including extra-task experience into their assessment of the predictive cue-outcome relationship in whatever context it occurred. However, for mildly depressed participants, adjacent behaviours and similarity between the extra-task experience and the main task, influenced information integration, with patterns of 'over-integration' evident, rather than neglect as we had expected. Findings are suggestive of over-generalised experience on the part of mildly depressed participants.PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe.

Murphyca Centre for Social Issues Research, Department of Psychology, University of Limerick, Republic of Irelandb Health Research Institute, University of Limerick, Republic of Irelandc Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, UKA B S T R A C TEvidence shows that there are individual diﬀerences in the extent to which people attend to and integrateinformation into their decisions about the predictive contingencies between events and outcomes. In particular,information about the absence of events or outcomes, presented outside the current task frame, is oftenneglected. This trend is particularly evident in depression, as well as other psychopathologies, though reasons forinformation neglect remain unclear. We investigated this phenomenon across two experiments (Experiment 1:N= 157; Experiment 2: N= 150) in which participants, scoring low and high in the Beck Depression Inventory,were asked to learn a simple predictive relationship between a visual cue and an auditory outcome. Wemanipulated whether or not participants had prior experience of the visual cue outside of the task frame,whether such experience took place in the same or diﬀerent context to the learning task, and the nature of theaction required to signal occurrence of the auditory outcome. We found that all participants were capable ofincluding extra-task experience into their assessment of the predictive cue-outcome relationship in whatevercontext it occurred. However, for mildly depressed participants, adjacent behaviours and similarity between theextra-task experience and the main task, inﬂuenced information integration, with patterns of ‘over-integration’evident, rather than neglect as we had expected. Findings are suggestive of over-generalised experience on thepart of mildly depressed participants.Learning about the relationships between stimuli or behaviour andsubsequent outcomes is fundamental to human ability to functionadaptively within an environment. Given our evolutionary success, itmight make sense to assume that human learning follows normativerules (e.g., Crocker, 1981; Tversky & Kahneman, 1989) that wouldfacilitate appropriate future behaviour. However, such rules ofteninclude the assumption that all information relevant to a givenrelationship is equally weighted. Evidence actually shows that mostpeople weight some information types more highly than others(Kao &Wasserman, 1993; Mandel & Lehman, 1998; Wasserman, Elek,Chatlosh, & Baker, 1993) and almost neglect other equally relevantinformation (Mata, Garcia-Marques, Ferreira, &Mendonça, 2015;White, 2002). As we will explain below, the neglect of speciﬁc typesof information is subject to individual diﬀerences and is much moreapparent in depressed than non-depressed people (Msetﬁ, Murphy,Simpson, & Kornbrot, 2005) although the reasons for this neglectremain unclear. The current research examines this diﬀerence.The matrix shown in Fig. 1 (below) provides a simple framework forstudying the information that is thought to contribute to learning aboutthe co-occurrence of two stimuli. Here, we refer to the stimuli as theevent and the outcome in order to distinguish between them and toemphasise the temporal order of causal relationships. The letters in thecells of the matrix denote the frequency of each information type orevent-outcome conjunction. ΔP is the normative measure of thestrength and direction of the relationship and is based on the assump-tion that each event-outcome conjunction is equally relevant andimportant to the contingency between event and outcome (Allan,1980). People's actions in anticipating, predicting or generating out-comes, and their judgements about the strength of the relation can bemapped onto ΔP and this assumption tested.In the laboratory, researchers have exposed participants to event-outcome information over a number of experimental trials, usuallyseparated by inter-trial intervals (e.g., Alloy & Abramson, 1979;Dickinson, Shanks, & Evenden, 1984), though some have used tabularpresentation (e.g., Greville & Buehner, 2007; Vallée-Tourangeau,Payton, &Murphy, 2008; White, 2002).

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/BY/4.0/).MARKprevious research include, for example, the brief presentation of anauditory or visual stimulus (e.g., geometric shape), ﬁctional real worldevents (e.g., fertiliser given, ﬂower blooms) or an action made by theparticipant (e.g., button press), with predictive behaviours (e.g.,Kattner & Green, 2016), operant behaviours (e.g., Msetﬁ,Murphy, & Kornbrot, 2012) and contingency judgements (e.g.,Allan & Jenkins, 1983) used as dependent measures. Findings showthat such measures are sensitive to diﬀerent levels of contingency, andthat correlations with the normative ΔP model are high (r= 0.8,Allan & Jenkins, 1980; r= 0.98, Wasserman et al., 1993) with varia-bility which depends on the precise procedure used.In spite of such high correlations between dependent measures andthe normative model, evidence also suggests that the information in thecells of the contingency matrix is weighted unequally. One example isKao and Wasserman's (1993) study, which involved comparisonsbetween pairs of contingency conditions that were constructed speci-ﬁcally to identify the weight that participants gave to each cell orconjunction. Over a series of experiments, with both tabular and trial-by-trial presentation, data suggested that participants weighted theinformation unequally, such that cell ‘a’ > cell ‘b’ > cell ‘c’ >cell ‘d’, in terms of contribution to the contingency. Numerous otherstudies have reported evidence consistent with this ﬁnding (e.g.,Crocker, 1981; Shaklee &Wasserman, 1986; Wasserman,Dorner, & Kao, 1990). Thus, overall, it seems that occasions whenevents and outcomes are present are more salient and perhaps areconsidered to be more important than their absence, even though theirabsence is equally relevant to the problem at hand according to anormative analysis. Furthermore event and outcome absence informa-tion is considered of least importance and is often neglected ordiscounted in learning (Mata et al., 2015).Thus data from contingency learning studies evidences high corre-lations with the normative model along with unequal weighting andsometimes neglect of ‘absence’ information. In spite of this, evidencealso shows that people can and will integrate ‘absence’ information,with a strong eﬀect on learning. This type of integration is particularlyclear when the information is presented outside of the current taskframe. One example of this was provided by Msetﬁ et al. (2005) whoexposed participants to zero contingency conditions in which the eventwas an action and the outcome was a light ﬂash. The key ﬁnding wasthat healthy participants judged the action-outcome relation to bestronger when inter-trial intervals (ITI) were long than when they wereshort. It was argued that the ITI, although taking place outside of thetask frame itself (the trial), contained no actions and no outcomes andas such was conceptually the same as the absence informationcontained in cell ‘d’ of the contingency matrix. Thus, results suggestedthat participants integrated this information into their contingencyjudgements and that the true contingency was inﬂated as a conse-quence. Therefore, in spite of evidence for the neglect of cell ‘d’ absenceinformation, this data shows that people can and will use it (see also forgoal directed behaviour, Mata et al., 2015).Another classic example of the integration of absence informationfrom outside the task frame involves cell ‘b’ of the contingency table. Inlatent inhibition procedures (Lubow&Moore, 1959), participants arepre-exposed to an event in the absence of an outcome before the maintask itself commences. They are subsequently required to learn that thesame event is predictive of an outcome. Typically, results show that theabsence information, which is presented initially (event-no outcome), isintegrated into subsequent learning because such learning is slower inpre-exposed participants in comparison to those who did not experiencepre-exposure (Escobar, Arcediano, &Miller, 2003; Gray et al., 2001).Therefore, people can and will use absence information and it has apowerful eﬀect on learning.So far, we have described evidence that, in some procedures,absence information is considered relevant and is integrated (e.g.,Escobar, Arcediano, &Miller, 2002; Msetﬁ et al., 2005), yet in otherprocedures, absence information is neglected or simply plays a lesssalient role in human learning and behaviour. Whilst that topic is ofinterest in its own right, in the current study we are particularlyinterested in understanding how depression inﬂuences informationneglect and integration.One example of this is that people with mild depression are lesslikely to integrate absence information from outside the task frame intotheir contingency learning as non-depressed people do. Evidence comesfrom studies showing that extending the duration of the inter-trialinterval had no eﬀect on contingency learning for participants withmild levels of depression (Msetﬁ, Murphy, & Simpson, 2007; Msetﬁet al., 2005). Although other disorders are not the focus of this paper,we note that there are instances of information neglect related to otherindividual diﬀerences. Speciﬁcally, people with schizophrenia (e.g.,Baruch, Hemsley, & Gray, 1988; Gray, Hemsley, & Gray, 1992;Guterman, Josiassen, Bashore, Johnson, & Lubow, 1996), and healthypeople with high levels of schizotypy (Braunstein-Bercovitz & Lubow,1998; Gray, Fernandez, Williams, Ruddle, & Snowden, 2002; Lubow,Ingberg-Sachs, Zalstein-Orda, & Gewirtz, 1992) also neglect absenceinformation under pre-exposure conditions in latent inhibition proce-dures. Counter intuitively, because the individual diﬀerence relates topsychopathology, this neglect leaves their learning intact. Dependingon the particular situation, information integration could be helpful orunhelpful to people's ability to behave adaptively in a given situationand it is important that we understand the conditions and individualdiﬀerences that aﬀect integration.In this paper, we are particularly interested in the eﬀects ofdepression on information neglect and integration. Brieﬂy, theoreticalexplanations for other individual diﬀerence eﬀects have involvedassociative learning processes, invoking impaired attention and aninability to ﬁlter irrelevant information or to learn about context(e.g., Hall & Rodriguez, 2010; Lubow, Feldon, &Weiner, 1988; Msetﬁ,Wade, &Murphy, 2013) amongst others. However, it has also beenargued that what is being measured in many such studies is not learningper se but rather (and related to methodological issues) a decisionmechanism based on computation of conditional probabilities (for adiscussion see: Le Pelley & Schmidt-Hansen, 2010) as in the contingencymatrix given in Fig. 1.The contingency framework is useful for our purposes here and mayprovide some much needed clarity. Rather than focusing on theunderlying learning processes and the purpose of each component ofthe task (although we plan to return to these later), the contingencyframework merely identiﬁes the type of information, which is presentin a given task, and has or has not been integrated into learning. Thisalso allows us to compute a normative metric that simply describes thestrength of the relationship in either case. This framework avoids someof the theoretical and interpretational confusion that is less than helpfulwhen trying to understand individual diﬀerences. Moreover, it shouldFig. 1. Generic contingency matrix showing the relationship between the occurrence ofan event (e.g., action or event) and the occurrence of an outcome. The notations a, b, c,and d refer to the frequencies of each event-outcome conjunction. The normative modelfor the one-way relation between them is ΔP. ΔP= a / (a + b) – c / (c + d) andgenerates a number between −1 and +1 denoting the strength and direction of therelationship. This is based on the assumption that the weighting of each conjunction isequal a = b = c = d.R.M. Msetﬁ et al. Acta Psychologica 178 (2017) 1–112allow us to identify the speciﬁc subtypes of absence information towhich individual diﬀerences are sensitive.Returning to information neglect in depression, there are a numberof dissociable components to the extra-trial (inter-trial interval) in-formation that people with depression do not integrate into theirlearning. Thus, it is not clear whether depression compromises sensi-tivity to one or a number of these aspects (see Table 1).In the experiments reported in this paper, we planned to examinethe diﬀerent types of information shown in Table 1, to elucidate reasonsfor increased informational neglect in depression speciﬁcally anddepression eﬀects on learning more generally. As in many previousstudies, participants were categorised (Msetﬁ, Cavus, & Brosnan, 2016;Msetﬁ et al., 2013) by their scores on the Beck Depression Inventory(BDI: Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961) as mildlydepressed or not depressed. These criteria are well validated forcategorising student participants into these groups and have yieldeddepression diﬀerences on similar learning tasks (Chase et al., 2011).We chose to use a simple behavioural task in which participants hadto learn about the relationship between the occurrence of a visualstimulus and the subsequent occurrence of a brief auditory stimulus.Absence information presented outside the current task frame wasmanipulated and subsequent learning was then measured via therecording of predictions made on each trial. These predictions weremade by participants through their behaviour, such that both instancesof actions and no actions were predictions of the occurrence and non-occurrence of the auditory stimulus.This procedure deviates in important ways from the no/action andno/outcome contingency procedures used to detect depression eﬀectsin previous research (Alloy & Abramson, 1979; Msetﬁ et al., 2005). Inprevious studies, a trial marker stimulus would indicate the partici-pants' opportunity to act, which might generate the occurrence of anoutcome. In the present study, an analogous set of stimuli wasexperienced but for somewhat diﬀerent reasons. First, the predictivestimulus occurred, then the participants made their predictive response(action, or no action) and then the outcome stimulus occurred or not.So, the stimulus sequence (event, action, outcome) is almost identicalbetween this and previous studies. This description simpliﬁes thediﬀerence between this and previous research with the aim of allowingus to study, systematically, the eﬀects of the various aspects ofinformation neglect and integration, speciﬁcally ‘absence’ informationon learning.1. Experiment 1In this ﬁrst experiment, we tested whether depressed and non-depressed people's learning about the relationship between a predictivestimulus and an outcome is aﬀected by exposure to contextualinformation and the absence of outcomes which occur outside thecurrent task frame (see Table 1). In this study, in order to make the‘additional information’ explicit, the contingency learning task wasdivided into two phases, as in a latent inhibition task (e.g.,Lubow&Moore, 1959), with the additional information presented inthe ﬁrst phase.In Phase 1, 80 trials exposed participants to the stimuli of criticalinterest in this study. Half of the participants experienced the predictivestimulus (pre-exposure group) in the absence of reinforcement, whilstthe other half (no pre-exposure group) experienced context alone in theabsence of reinforcement. In addition, the experimental task contextwas either the same or diﬀerent to the subsequent second phase. In allcases, there was no exposure to the outcome stimulus in Phase 1.Then, in the second phase, all participants were asked to predict theoccurrence of a brief auditory stimulus (explosion) by performing anaction (button press). Over 160 trials, the predictive stimulus was eitherpresent (stimulus = , k = 20) or it was absent (stimulus = ,k = 140). A summary of the procedure used in Phase 2 is given inFig. 2 below, and summarises the stimuli, actions and outcomes presentor absent on each trial. In no pre-exposure conditions (Fig. 2, left), thereis a perfect contingency, ΔP= 1, between the predictive stimulus andthe occurrence of the outcome. However, in pre-exposure conditionsthe perfect ΔP value is degraded by numerous presentations of thepredictive stimulus outside of the task frame in Phase 1 (see +80 addedTable 1Dissociable informational components of inter-trial interval information.Inter-trial intervals Type of information(i) No outcomes occur Absence of reinforcement(ii) No events occur Absence of stimulus(iii) No actions occur Absence of behaviour(iv) Inter-trial intervals take place in acontextContextual information is present(v) Inter-trial intervals take place outsideof the experimental trialAdditional information outsidethe task frameFig. 2.

This allowedus to test sensitivity to two of the ﬁve information types in Table 1,whilst controlling for the others. If participants are sensitive to theabsence of reinforcement information presented in Phase 1, then Fig. 2shows that there should be weaker learning in the pre-exposure groupin Phase 2. In addition, if participants are sensitive to the contextualaspect of this learning task, this pattern should only be evident inparticipants for whom Phase 1 context is the same as Phase 2 context.Moreover, depressive diﬀerences in sensitivity to the context, eitherincreased or decreased sensitivity, should be evident in the size of pre-exposure eﬀects in the diﬀerent contexts.1.1. Method1.1.1. ParticipantsParticipants completed the BDI online to measure their mood statebefore being invited to participate and then, again, on arrival to takepart in the experiment. These participants were recruited from twouniversity populations (n1 = 117, 75%; n2 = 40, 25%). The resultingsample of 157 participants were assigned to the high BDI (n= 60,female: n= 39, male: n= 13) or low BDI (n= 97, female: n= 58,male: n= 24) groups, based on a median cut oﬀ of 5 on the BDI(BDI > 5 = high, BDI≤ 5 = low), as we have previously observedBDI eﬀects with a cut-oﬀ point of 5 (see Chase et al., 2011). Overall andas expected, the BDI groups diﬀered on BDI scores, t (155) = 14.92,p < 0.001, as well as DASS anxiety, depression and stress scores, allts > 5.05, all ps < 0.001.Participants in each mood group were then randomly assigned toone of four experimental groups, pre-exposure/same context, no pre-exposure/same context, pre-exposure/diﬀerent context, no pre-expo-sure/diﬀerent context. The four experimental groups were successfullymatched on digit span and estimated IQ, a univariate ANOVA gave F(3,153) < 1, p= 0.977, and F(3, 153) < 1, p= 0.497, respectively forthese measures. The groups did not diﬀer on BDI or DASS anxiety,depression and stress scales scores, all Fs < 1, all ps > 0.43.Participants from each data collection site were equally distributedacross experimental groups (Table 2).1.1.2. DesignA fully factorial 2 × 2 × 2 design was employed with BDI group(low BDI, high BDI), exposure group (pre-exposure, no pre-exposure)and context group (same context, diﬀerent context) as between-subjectsfactors. Two dependent variables were analysed in this study. The ﬁrstdependent variable was the number of trials taken to reach the successcriterion (see Gray et al., 1992), and was recorded as the number oftrials taken in Phase 2 to reach ﬁve consecutive correct responses withno false alarms. The second dependent variable used here was D-prime(D′), which compares the target ‘hit’ rate to the false alarm rate (i.e. Z[p(hit)]− Z[p(false alarm)]). This psychophysical measure provides anindex of participants' sensitivity to the target, but normalises this fornumber of target versus non-target presentations, and response tenden-cies. The latter might be argued to inﬂate traditional trials to criterionmeasures. In addition D′ can be calculated over trial blocks and it istherefore possible to examine speed of learning in each condition. Herewe report both measures in order to ensure comparability with previouswork.1.1.3. Materials1.1.3.1. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI: Beck et al., 1961). The BDI is aself-report inventory of depression symptoms and has been used inresearch with clinical and student populations for many years.Participants were asked to choose from 21 statements that bestdescribe them. These ranged from neutral statements (e.g., I do notfeel like a failure) scored as 0, to more extreme mood related statements(e.g., I feel I am a complete failure as a person) scored as up to a valueof 3. Total scores could range from 0 to 63 where higher scores indicatehigher levels of depression. The BDI has been validated in studentsamples, with correlations of 0.77 being reported between BDI scoresand a psychiatric rating of severity of depression (Bumberry,Oliver, &McClure, 1978).1.1.3.2. Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS: Lovibond & Lovibond,1995). The DASS is a 42-item self-report questionnaire that yieldsthree subscales, measuring the severity of depression, anxiety and stresssymptoms. Participants rate each item (e.g., I found myself gettingupset by quite trivial things) on a scale of 0 to 3, indicating the extent towhich this had applied to them in the past week. A score of 3 wouldindicate that the statement had applied to the participant most of thetime. There are 14 items for each of the emotional states and eachsubscale can yield a maximum possible score of 42.1.1.3.3. Learning task. All experimental stimuli were programmed andpresented using computer (REALbasic, 2009, Release 2.1). Realisticgraphics of rooms containing a TV cabinet and a TV were used torepresent distinct contexts (see Appendix 1). For the same contextcondition, the room in Phase 1 and Phase 2 was always a blue bedroom.The diﬀerent context condition exposed participants to the same bluebedroom in Phase 1, and a green bedroom in Phase 2.For all participants, Phase 1 involved the presentation of three-lettercodes constructed using three sets of 40 randomly selected letterspresented over 80 trials. The letters were shown on the screen in asequence, like ‘H Q J’, and written in white bold Helvetica size 36 fontwith 25 pixels in between each letter. The top of each letter waspositioned to be 25 pixels below the top of the shape on which it wassuperimposed. For participants in the pre-exposure group, the predic-tive stimulus appeared behind the letter codes. Participants in the no-pre exposure group simply saw the letter codes.Table 2Participant characteristics for Experiment 1.Pre-exposure No pre-exposureSame context Diﬀerent context Same context Diﬀerent contextLow BDI High BDI Low BDI High BDI Low BDI High BDI Low BDI High BDIn= 27 n= 18 n= 23 n= 13 n= 23 n= 15 n= 24 n= 14BDI 2.33 (0.30) 11.22 (1.63) 1.74 (0.35) 12.31 (1.55) 2.65 (0.35) 13.60 (1.52) 2.13 (0.37) 9.21 (0.96)DASS-D 1.85 (0.41) 8.67 (1.61) 1.65 (0.50) 8.00 (1.73) 2.48 (0.52) 8.40 (1.84) 2.83 (0.68) 7.00 (0.96)DASS-S 4.67 (0.78) 9.78 (1.14) 3.70 (0.98) 9.62 (1.13) 4.91 (0.81) 10.47 (1.82) 3.92 (0.77) 10.50 (1.71)DASS-A 1.81 (0.36) 7.00 (1.51) 3.22 (1.07) 6.46 (1.35) 2.17 (0.44) 8.20 (1.97) 2.63 (0.91) 8.86 (4.02)Estimated IQ 110.36 (1.29) 110.65 (1.41) 111.17 (1.18) 112.05 (1.12) 110.37 (1.58) 110.78 (1.13) 109.99 (1.21) 108.13 (1.90)Digit 7.44 (0.40) 7.83 (0.28) 7.52 (0.29) 7.77 (0.47) 7.70 (0.29) 7.47 (0.22) 7.17 (0.38) 8.00 (0.30)NB.

Acta Psychologica 178 (2017) 1–114In the Phase 2, a 500 ms auditory stimulus occurred on 20 of the160 experimental trials following presentation of the predictive stimu-lus. The predictive stimulus was a blue triangle shape and was150 pixels wide and 100 pixels in height. On the other 140 trials, thepredictive stimulus was absent and a blue square shape, 100 pixels wideand 100 pixels in height, was shown. During presentation, both stimuliwere positioned centrally on the TV screen and the TV itself waspositioned centrally in terms of screen width and 75% of screen heightfrom the top of the screen (see Appendix 1).1.1.4. ProcedureAfter reading an information sheet and having the opportunity toask questions, participants gave informed consent to their participation.They then completed a range of demographic questions, the digit spantask, the BDI and DASS. Demographic data were used to estimate pre-morbid IQ (for method and equations see Barona, Reynolds, & Chastain,1984).Following this, participants were asked to read the instructions forPhase 1 of the learning task (see Appendix 2). Participants would play agame during which they would be taken to a virtual room, containing aTV and games console, visualised by a realistic picture displayed on thecomputer screen. A series of three-letter codes would appear on the TVscreen and participants were asked to note the fourth code and counthow many times it reoccurred. There were 40 codes and each one wasdisplayed twice over 80 trials in a random order. Each trial andstimulus exposure lasted for 1500 ms and was separated from the nexttrial by a 500 ms inter-trial interval. For the pre-exposure condition, thethree-letter code was superimposed over a blue triangle on thetelevision screen. In the no pre-exposure condition, the three-lettercode simply appeared on the TV screen. In all cases, the three-lettercode was centred on the TV screen. At the end of the 80 trials,participants were required to enter the number of times they had seenthe fourth code using the computer keyboard.Phase 2 instructions stated that participants would be taken to aroom with a TV and games console and that a series of three-lettercodes would appear on the TV screen (see Appendix 2). As in Phase 1,the room was a virtual room represented by pictures on the computerscreen, and was the same for the context same group, and diﬀerent toPhase 1 for the context diﬀerent group. Participants were told that,during this second game, they might notice the occurrence of somesmall explosions. Their task was to work out the rule that guided theoccurrence of the explosions. Participants were asked to press the spacebar every time they thought the explosion was about to occur. The same40 three-letter codes used in Phase 1 were also used in Phase 2, witheach block of 40 codes presented in a random order during four blocksof 40 experimental trials, resulting in a total of 160 experimental trials.The timing of each trial was the same as Phase 1.For each block, 5 of the 40 trials included presentation of thepredictive stimulus for 1500 ms, followed by the sound stimulus, whichhad a duration of 500 ms. On the other 35 trials, the predictive stimuluswas absent for 1500 ms after which the sound stimulus was not playedand there was silence for 500 ms. Trial timing was therefore exactly thesame as for Phase 1. Responses were only possible during the 1500 msdisplay of the predictive stimulus. At the end of the 1500 ms interval,the trial was coded as a response or non-response trial. Order of trialswas randomised across blocks. After 160 trials, the game ended andparticipants were debriefed, thanked and received a nominal paymentin return for their participation.1.2. Results and discussionResponse data was collected on every trial in Phase 2 and a scorebased on trials taken to reach criterion and a value for D′ for each trialblock were calculated for each participant. These data are displayedseparately below and our observations were tested using a betweensubjects and mixed factorial ANOVAs where appropriate, with alphaheld constant at 0.05 throughout unless stated otherwise.1.2.1. Trials to criterionFig. 3 suggests that for all participants, irrespective of their moodstate, pre-exposure to the non-reinforced predictive stimulus in anycontext in Phase 1 resulted in the perception of a weak relationshipbetween stimulus and outcome in Phase 2.The results of the ANOVA showed that there was a signiﬁcant maineﬀect of pre-exposure condition, F(1, 149) = 39.37, p < 0.001,ηp2 = 0.209, with participants in the pre-exposure group taking onaverage 7 more trials to reach criterion than the no pre-exposure group.There were no other signiﬁcant main eﬀects or signiﬁcant interactions,all Fs < 2.09, all ps > 0.14.1.2.2. D-primeAs there was no evidence of a context eﬀect, for clarity, we havecollapsed D′ data over context conditions in Fig. 4. Increasing values forD′ indicate that target sensitivity increased rapidly over trial blocks,with the pre-exposure eﬀect evident from block 1 to block 4.The results of the mixed factorial ANOVA supported these observa-tions, with a large signiﬁcant eﬀect of pre-exposure group, F(1, 149)= 34.88, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.19. The main eﬀect of trial block wassigniﬁcant, F(3, 447) = 139.01, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.483, as was theblock by pre-exposure interaction, F(3, 447) = 6.10, p < 0.001,ηp2 = 0.039. Follow-up simple eﬀects analyses showed that whilst thepre-exposure eﬀect was signiﬁcant across trial blocks, it reduced in sizeFig. 3.

There were no other eﬀects orinteractions that were reliable or approached the signiﬁcance criterion.Overall, the results of this experiment showed that exposure to astimulus in the absence of outcomes, outside of the frame of the currenttask, weakens learning as predicted in Fig. 2. However, the contextmanipulation had no eﬀect. This was the case for both depressed andnon-depressed participants. Therefore, Experiment 1 indicated nodiﬀerences in learning between depressed and non-depressed peopleand showed that subsequent learning is sensitive to the presentation ofnon-reinforced stimuli presented outside the frame of the current task.These data suggest that neither sensitivity to no outcome andcontext are compromised in mild depression, and perhaps that previousreports of learning impairments in people with depression reﬂectprocessing other aspects of absence information. For example, theexperimental manipulations in Experiment 1 were situated in the toprow of the contingency matrix, shown in Fig. 1. As we described in theintroduction, the top row of the contingency relates to the frequenciesof outcomes and no outcomes in the presence of the predictive stimulus.This experimental manipulation of pre-exposing participants to in-stances of the predictive stimulus in the absence of the outcome mightbe thought of as ‘cell b’ type experience. This manipulation failed toevidence eﬀects of depression on learning and shows that depressedpeople can and will integrate information from outside the task frameinto subsequent performance.However, as we noted in the introduction, previous studies havespeciﬁcally suggested that depression eﬀects are focussed on informa-tion contained in the least weighted cell of the contingency matrix, ‘celld’. Not only does cell d include no outcomes and context, it alsoinvolves the absence of behaviour or actions. Therefore, in order to testsensitivity to absence of actions and outcomes, Experiment 2 reversedparticipants' predictive response requirement in Phase 2. This meantthat the behaviour required to predict the outcome was ‘no action’,whereas an ‘action’ was required to predict a ‘no outcome’ trial. Asecondary eﬀect of this manipulation is to equate the informationalcontent of Phase 1 pre-exposure with Phase 2.2. Experiment 2In order to test participants' sensitivity to the absence of actions andoutcomes, rather than the absence of outcome only, we adjusted theexperimental procedure and reversed the response requirements. In allother aspects, the procedure was identical. Thus, in Experiment 2, theabsence of the predictive stimulus (rather than its presence, in Fig. 5labelled occurrence of event) required an action; this might be thoughtof as an ‘all clear’ action. The predictive stimulus itself did not requirean action because participants were required to take ‘no action’ if theythought the outcome was about to occur (in Fig. 5, labelled absence ofevent). Conceptually, this pre-exposure manipulation now involves thebottom row of the contingency table (cell d) rather than the top row(cell b). So, in other words, actions were to predict the ‘all clear’ (nooutcome) and no action would predict outcome occurrence. The aim ofthis manipulation was to test participants' sensitivity to pre-exposedinformation when marked by the absence of actions thus equating theinformational content of Phases 1 and 2. In summary, all aspects ofExperiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1, with the exception of theaction required on each trial.2.1. MethodOnly details that are diﬀerent to Experiment 1 are given here.2.1.1. ParticipantsParticipants were recruited from two university populations(n1 = 115, 77%; n2 = 34, 23%). The sample of 150 participants wereeither categorised as members of the high BDI (n= 77, female: n= 51,male: n= 26) or low BDI (n= 73, female: n= 47, male: n= 26)groups, see Table 3. Overall, the low and high BDI groups diﬀered onBDI scores, t(148) = 15.40, p < 0.001, 95% CI[8.87, 11.48], as well asDASS anxiety, depression and stress scores, all ts > 7.50, all ps <0.001. Experimental conditions were successfully matched on digitspan and estimated IQ; a multivariate ANOVA gave F(3, 146) = 1.61,p= 0.189, and F(3, 146) < 1, p= 0.492, respectively for thesemeasures. The four conditions did not diﬀer on BDI, DASS anxiety,depression and stress scales scores, all F < 1.97, all ps > 0.12.Participants from the two recruitment sites were equally distributedacross experimental groups.2.1.2. ProcedureParticipants were requested to press the spacebar on the computerkeyboard, when they thought the sound stimulus was not likely tooccur, and to do nothing when the sound stimulus was likely to occur.Fig. 5.

Msetﬁ et al. Acta Psychologica 178 (2017) 1–1162.2. Results and discussion2.2.1. Trials to criterionTrials to criterion scores are shown in Fig. 6. For low BDI groups, thedata are similar to the previous experiment. Low BDI participants in thepre-exposure group took 8 trials longer to reach criterion than low BDIparticipants in the no pre-exposure group, who reached criterion at theﬁrst opportunity. However, high BDI participants appeared to takeequally as many trials to reach criterion irrespective of pre-exposure(Fig. 6).Consistent with these observations, the ANOVA showed signiﬁcantmain eﬀects of pre-exposure group, F(1, 142) = 25.27, p < 0.001,ηp2 = 0.151, and BDI group, F(1, 142) = 5.18, p= 0.024, ηp2 = 0.035,as well as a signiﬁcant interaction between them, F(1, 142) = 7.93,p= 0.006, ηp2 = 0.053. There were no other reliable main eﬀects orinteractions. Follow up simple eﬀects tests showed that the low BDIgroup took signiﬁcantly longer to reach criterion in the pre-exposuregroup than in the non pre-exposure group, F(1, 142) = 30.37,p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.17. Moreover, the trials to criterion score of thenon-pre-exposure, low BDI group (M= 6.42, SE = 0.88) did not diﬀersigniﬁcantly from the best possible score of 5, t(37) = 1.62, p= 0.114.Scores for the other three groups were signiﬁcantly> 5, all ts > 5.49,all ps < 0.001. There was no reliable diﬀerence between pre-exposureand no pre-exposure groups for high BDI participants, F(1, 142) = 2.48,p= 0.118, ηp2 = 0.017.In order to explore the absence of the pre-exposure eﬀect in highBDI participants further, we compared their trials to criterion scoresacross Experiments 1 and 2. For the no pre-exposure groups, perfor-mance was signiﬁcantly worse in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1, F(1,63) = 10.02, MSE = 46.05, p= 0.002. However for the pre-exposuregroups, there was no reliable diﬀerence in performance between thetwo experiments, F < 1, p > 0.5.2.2.2.

Similar to the criteriondata, D′ suggests that whilst the eﬀect of pre-exposure is very evidentfor low BDI participants, the eﬀect may be absent for high BDIparticipants. If anything, there seemed to be stronger trends in diﬀerentthan same context conditions.The analysis showed that D′ values were signiﬁcantly aﬀected bypre-exposure, F(1, 142) = 19.26, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.119, trial block,F(3, 426) = 78.63, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.356, and BDI group, F(1, 142)= 8.41, p= 0.004, ηp2 = 0.056. There were also signiﬁcant interac-tions between trial block and pre-exposure, F(3, 426) = 3.95,p= 0.008, ηp2 = 0.027, and BDI group and pre-exposure, F(1, 142)= 4.93, p= 0.028, ηp2 = 0.034. The interaction between trial blockand context group approached but did not reach the level of signiﬁ-cance, F(3, 426) = 2.60, p= 0.052, ηp2 = 0.018. Follow up simpleeﬀects analyses showed that, as in Experiment 1, the size of the pre-exposure eﬀect reduced over trial blocks (block 1 ηp2 = 0.156, block 2ηp2 = 0.113, block 3 ηp2 = 0.073, block 4 ηp2 = 0.031), whilst remain-ing signiﬁcant throughout. The further exploration of the BDI by pre-exposure interaction showed that whilst low BDI groups showed astrong pre-exposure eﬀect, F(1, 142) = 21.56, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.132,high BDI groups did not, F(1, 142) = 2.38, p= 0.125, ηp2 = 0.016. Inaddition, whilst there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between high and lowBDI D′ values in no pre-exposure conditions, F(1, 142) = 12.99,p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.084, there was no diﬀerence between the groupsin pre-exposure conditions, F < 1, suggesting that high BDI perfor-mance was equally poor irrespective of pre-exposure.Taken together, our ﬁndings here suggest that non-depressedparticipants are equally sensitive to stimuli presented with no outcomesoutside of the immediate task frame, irrespective of context, whether ornot that information is accompanied by the presence or absence ofaction. Depressed participants, however, only displayed sensitivity tothe pre-exposure manipulation when it was marked by actions and notwhen it was marked by the absence of actions. In the secondexperiment, depressed participants' learning was equally poor whetheror not they were pre-exposed.3. General discussionIn this series of experiments, we set out to answer the question ofwhy people with mild depression do not integrate contingency infor-mation presented outside the current task frame into their learning likenon-depressed people do. We reasoned that properties of the informa-tion itself caused this pattern, such as diﬀerential sensitivity to absenceinformation (of stimuli, of outcomes of behaviour), to context or simplyhaving a very speciﬁc frame of reference (e.g., constrained focal set ofevents, Cheng &Novick, 1990) for on-going learning. We found thatinformation presented outside of the frame of the current taskinﬂuenced all of our participants' contingency learning, in somecircumstances. According to these ﬁndings, people who are mildlydepressed are equally capable as others of integrating presentations ofstimuli, which are unaccompanied by outcomes, into their contingencylearning. However, when that information was accompanied by theabsence of action, across both experimental phases, rather than just thepre-exposure phase, then sensitivity to the presence versus absence ofthat information was eliminated and performance was generally poor.In order to explicate these ﬁndings further, we ﬁrst discuss possibleexplanations for these eﬀects before discussing implications for theory,depression and limitations of the work.3.1. Theoretical implicationsLearning about the relationships between events or actions andoutcomes has been subject to analysis using a contingency frameworkfor the last 50 years (e.g., Jenkins &Ward, 1965; Ward & Jenkins,1965). Researchers have investigated the ﬁt between human contin-gency judgements and various rules for combining information from thecontingency matrix into one measure (e.g., Allan, 1980; Cheng, 1997).All these rules share the assumption of equal weighting of contingencyinformation although this has been shown to be violated on numerousoccasions (e.g., Crocker, 1981; Shaklee &Wasserman, 1986; Wassermanet al., 1990). A more fundamental assumption is that contingencyinformation (cells a through d) and their weighting in learning is basedon properties of relevant stimuli themselves. So, for example, cell ‘a’ ishighly weighted because the stimulus is present and the reinforcingoutcome is also present. Cell ‘d’ is weighted low or neglected becauseboth stimulus and reinforcing outcome are absent.One implication of our ﬁndings may be that weighting based on‘stimulus properties’ themselves may not always occur. ‘Adjacent’stimulus information, such as whether other stimuli or actions arepresent, also inﬂuences the extent to which people weight and integrateinformation into their learning. We have come to this initial conclusionbecause the key diﬀerence between Experiments 1 and 2 is whether thepre-exposed predictive stimulus was accompanied by diﬀerent actionsacross Phases 1 and 2, as in Experiment 1 (Phase 1: no action; Phase 2:action), or by the same actions, as in Experiment 2 (Phase 1: no action;Phase 2: no action).For the non-depressed, the diﬀerence or similarity between the twophases did not matter; they still evidenced the predicted perception of aweak contingency between stimulus and outcome in pre-exposureconditions. This is consistent with the idea that exposure to or learningabout the predictive stimulus itself and its properties governed theirperformance in Phase 2. At ﬁrst glance, it seemed that in Experiment 2,pre-exposure information had no impact on depressed participants,suggesting complete information neglect. However, closer examinationof both data sets (statistical comparison Experiment 1 versusExperiment 2) suggested a diﬀerent conclusion. In Experiment 2, theperformance of depressed participants was equally poor in bothExperiment 2 conditions and comparable to their pre-exposure perfor-mance in Experiment 1.This analysis suggests then that, for depressed participants, it wasnot their experience of the predictive stimulus that determined theirperformance but the adjacent non-action experience. Furthermore, theintegration or neglect of speciﬁc types of information may not be agiven based simply on the properties of the stimuli themselves. Rather,based on the performance of our depressed participants, informationweighting or neglect may be dynamic and dependent on adjacentstimuli. This conclusion is based on the excellent performance thatdepressed participants displayed in Experiment 1 versus their very poorperformance observed in Experiment 2. This cross-experiment compar-ison suggests that depressed participants completely integrated theadjacent no-action information in Experiment 2, whether or not aspeciﬁc stimulus was pre-exposed. Thus it could be argued that the netresult of this, for depressed participants, was that Phase 1 trials wereintegrated into their cell ‘d’ experience in both the pre-exposure and nopre-exposure groups, as shown in Fig. 8. This would result in adegraded contingency for both groups and is consistent with the poorperformance we observed in both pre-exposed and non pre-exposedparticipants.On the basis of that analysis, we can return to the contingencycalculation to check the predictive power of the two stimuli that werepresented during Phase 2 of the task. Recall that the triangle, thestimulus which predicts outcomes, is now relocated to the lower row ofthe contingency table because both in Phase 1 and Phase 2 it occursalong with no actions (see Fig. 8, bottom half of the contingency tables).Assuming the complete integration of Phase 1 trials (+80), thepredictive power of the triangle computes to a weak contingency,where ΔP= 0.2. The predictive power of the square stimulus, whichdoes not predict the outcome, also computes to a weak contingency,but in the opposite direction, where ΔP=−0.2. Therefore thecontingency analysis [of these observed eﬀects] is that, for depressedparticipants, both the predictive and non-predictive cue had equallyweak predictive power (i.e. ΔP = 0.2 and ΔP =−0.2).R.M. Msetﬁ et al. Acta Psychologica 178 (2017) 1–118Fig. 8 further suggests that the individual diﬀerences reported hereare entirely consistent with a contingency framework applied toinformation integration. As we argued in the introduction, the con-tingency framework is attractive because it often provides an accurateaccount of the decisions people make in such conditions (LePelley & Schmidt-Hansen, 2010) and allows us to focus on the informa-tional content of experience on which individual diﬀerences are based.However, this approach does not provide much insight into theprocesses underlying the individual diﬀerence.For such insight, we might look to associative models, such as theRescorla-Wagner model (Rescorla &Wagner, 1972) and Pearce's modelof stimulus generalisation (Pearce, 1987), which explicitly show how‘adjacent’ stimuli can reduce the amount of associative strength (aconstruct which is used as isomorphic to contingency strength) that anyone stimulus can accumulate. Thus in our contingency analysis, shownin Fig. 8, of the depression eﬀect reported here, we showed howdepressed participants might be exposed to two very weak contingencyconditions, with their performance being consistent with this. Atasymptote, associative models often produce identical predictions tothe contingency framework but for diﬀerent reasons. From thatperspective, every stimulus present shares the limited amount ofassociative strength available for any given outcome. Thus, additionalstimuli present on learning trials will always compromise the ability ofthe others to acquire strength because of the shared nature ofassociations (e.g., Shanks, 1989). This process is known as cuecompetition. In addition, it is also the similarity between conﬁgurationsor groups of stimuli, which includes all stimuli present in a givencontext, that aﬀects the extent to which learning in one situation (e.g.,Phase 1) generalises to another situation (Phase 2) (Pearce, 1987).These theories might help answer the question as to why there arediﬀerences between the depressed and non-depressed. It could be thatcue competition itself is aﬀected by depression. If this were the casethen, for depressed people, this would mean that the predictivestimulus, and arguably the non-action, accumulate little of the availableassociative strength. Hence, in Experiment 2, their performance wasequally poor across conditions. Another suggestion links to the simi-larity between the task phases. It could be argued that the componentsof the learning task (e.g., , context, no action) were more similaracross the two learning phases in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1.This might indicate that, for our depressed participants, the greatersimilarity between Phases 1 and 2, drove strong generalisation from allof the events that occurred in Phase 1 to the events that occurred inPhase 2. Note that we use the term generalisation loosely here toindicate that Phase 1 exposure aﬀected and compromised Phase 2performance similarly in pre-exposure and no pre-exposure conditions.So, from the experimenter's perspective, the only pre-exposed stimuluswas the subsequently predictive stimulus (the blue triangle), and thispre-exposure eﬀect was always evident for non-depressed participants.However, for depressed participants, the entire array of stimuli includ-ing context and non-actions may have acted as the pre-exposedstimulus, which then generalised to Phase 2 compromising learningin both pre-exposure and no pre-exposure groups. In order to explaincompromised performance, we have to assume that both groups ofdepressed participants experienced a pre-exposure eﬀect. Indeed ourdata are consistent with this idea.There are multiple theoretical approaches which attempt to explainthe processes which underlie pre-exposure eﬀects, including retrievalfailure due to non-reinforced stimulus exposure (e.g., Bouton, 1993)and loss of salience (Rescorla &Wagner, 1972) or associability (e.g.,McLaren &Mackintosh, 2000) but there is little consensus in theliterature on which theory provides the most convincing account (LePelley & Schmidt-Hansen, 2010). However, the important point to notehere is that it was the additional between phase similarity evident inExperiment 2 that aﬀected depressed people's performance patterns -but not non-depressed - and this is why we might term theirperformance as ‘over-generalised’.This suggestion is interesting because in many cases depression'seﬀects on contingency learning have led to ‘better’ learning aboutactions and outcomes (e.g., depressive realism: Alloy & Abramson,1979) because of context information being neglected in their judge-ments. In this case, when depression eﬀects were apparent, poorerlearning resulted and this was not linked to learning about context. Thisexplanation is consistent with other evidence of ‘over-generalisation’ indepression (e.g., Rekart, Mineka, & Zinbarg, 2006; Williams & Scott,1988) which contributes depressive thinking styles and over-general-isation errors as described in cognitive theory of depression (Beck,1967; Clark, Beck, & Alford, 1999). Similar generalisation trends areevident in schizophrenia (e.g., Wood, Brewin, &McLeod, 2006) andother psychopathologies (see Hackmann &Holmes, 2004) suggestingthat generalisation may play a role in other well-known failures tointegrate information from outside the task frame (e.g., Baruch et al.,1988; Gray et al., 1992; Guterman et al., 1996). A further implication isthat for non-depressed participants there is an optimal generalisationproﬁle based on generalising relevant information and which onlyresults in impaired learning in speciﬁc conditions. We do note howeverthat this is only one possible explanation for our ﬁndings.For example, it could be argued that diﬀerences in learning betweenour depressed and non-depressed participants are based on the manip-ulation of the response alternatives between Experiments 1 and 2, andwhat we are reporting here is merely an artefact of behaviouralpassivity (e.g., Blanco, Matute, & Vadillo, 2009; Msetﬁ, Kumar,Harmer, &Murphy, 2016) in depression. We can reject this suggestionfor several reasons. Firstly, in both experiments, behavioural action andnon-action were both required for good performance. A participantFig. 8. Conditional probabilities and contingency calculations for Experiment 2 in the case of complete integration of Phase 1 information. NB: +80 refers to the addition of Phase 1 pre-exposure trials; * refers to the predictive response participants must make in each trial in Phase 2.R.M. Msetﬁ et al. Acta Psychologica 178 (2017) 1–119who, in Experiment 1, was able to predict the auditory outcome withthe action very successfully, would also have to withhold that action onnon-predictive trials. An error on either trial type would result in thetrials to criterion count being reset to zero. Similarly, in Experiment 2,whilst non-predictive trials required the action and predictive trials didnot, an error on either trial type matters. Any depressed participantwith aberrant response levels would produce poor scores in bothexperiments. Moreover, in both experiments, we calculated a targetsensitivity measure, known as D-prime, which is used in the psycho-physical literature to measure target sensitivity whilst discounting anykind of response bias. The D-prime data produced identical results tothe success criterion data. This suggests that our ﬁndings of depressioneﬀects are not simple behavioural artefacts of the diﬀerent responsealternative but are valid learning eﬀects.3.2. LimitationsAn obvious limitation of this study is that the depressed participants(high BDI groups) score above the median on the depression scalerather the score as depressed based on any standardised, clinicallyinformed cut oﬀ score (Beck et al., 1961). Here, as in other studies(Chase et al., 2011), we used this strategy for pragmatic reasons, tomaximise our sample size, but also under the assumption that thediﬀerences between non-depressed and depressed are continuous ratherthan qualitative in nature (Cox, Enns, Borger, & Parker, 1999) andshould therefore be present to a lesser degree in participants who scorejust above the median. In order to reassure readers on this point, wereanalysed our data excluding participants who scored between 5 (cutoﬀ used in this experiment for mild depression) and 9 (clinical cut oﬀ)on the BDI. Consistent with the continuity assumption, eﬀects werestronger in this reduced sample (ηp2 = 0.07) than in the mildlydepressed sample who scored above the median (ηp2 = 0.05).4. ConclusionsAs an answer to the question we posed in this paper, we concludethat depressed and non-depressed participants are both able to inte-grate no outcome information from outside the current task frame intosubsequent predictive learning. However, for mildly depressed partici-pants, integration was dependent on the similarity of accompanyinginformation, and we conclude that they experience strong patterns ofgeneralisation which can compromise their contingency learning insome conditions.Appendix A.

You will be given theinstructions for stage 2 after you have completed the ﬁrst stage. Duringthe game, you will be in a room where there is a TV. The TV isconnected to a games console, which has been set up and placed readyfor you to play. The room will look like the one shown on the right ofthis screen. The game involves computer codes. In the ﬁrst stage of thegame, you will see a series of 3-letter codes appear on the TV screen oneafter the other. It is very important that you pay attention to thesecodes. Your task is to identify the 4th code and then to count how manytimes it is repeated. You will be asked to report the number ofrepetitions at the end of this stage of the experiment. This part of theexperiment will take about 3 minutes. Please ask the experimenter ifyou have any questions.”Phase 2 instructions Experiment 1.“In the second Phase of the experiment, you will be in a room wherethe TV and the games console have been set up and placed ready foryou to play a game. The room will look similar to the picture you cansee on the right of the screen now. You will see a series of 3-lettercomputer codes presented one after the other on the TV screen. Duringthe game, you will also notice the occurrence of some small explosions.It is your task to discern the rule that guides when the explosionhappens. Whenever you think an explosion is ABOUT to take place, youshould press the SPACEBAR on the computer keyboard. Even when youthink you know the rule, please continue with the game. This part of theexperiment will take about 6 minutes. Please ask the experimenter ifyou have any questions.”Phase 2 instructions Experiment 2.“In the second phase of the experiment, you will be in a room wherethe TV and the games console have been set up and placed ready foryou to play a game. The room will look similar to the picture you cansee on the right of the screen now. You will see a series of 3-lettercomputer codes presented one after the other on the TV screen. Duringthe game, you will also notice the occurrence of some small explosions.It is your task to discern the rule that guides when the explosion isabout to happen and when it is not about to happen. So you need to dotwo things: Whenever you think that an explosion IS about to happen,signal this by doing nothing. So DO NOT PRESS the spacebar on thecomputer keyboard when you think that there WILL be an explosion.Whenever you think an explosion IS NOT about to happen, signal thisby pressing the spacebar. In other words, only PRESS the spacebar onthe computer keyboard every time you do not think an explosion willoccur. Even when you think you know the rule, please continue withthe game. This part of the experiment will take about 6 minutes. Pleaseask the experimenter if you have any questions.”R.M. Msetﬁ et al. Acta Psychologica 178 (2017) 1–1110ReferencesAllan, L. G. (1980).
