ABSTRACT: 
The world fauna of the genus Thoron is revised. The genus is described and Neothoron Masner is treated as a junior synonym (new synonymy). Relationships with Elgonia Risbec and other Scelionidae are discussed and a key to world species is presented. Six new species are described: T. dayi, new species (Indonesia), T. dux, new species (Bolivia, Venezuela), T. garciai, new species (Venezuela, Bolivia), T. rex, new species (Bolivia), Thoron rivalis, new species (Brazil, Panama), and T. spinifer, new species (Ecuador). Thoron metallicus Haliday (Holarctic), T. longicornis Masner and Huggert (USA), and T. lautus (Masner), new combi-nation (Ecuador, Bolivia) are redescribed; the female of T. lautus and the male of T. longicornis are described and keyed for the first time. Thoron gibbus Ruthe is treated as a junior synonym of T. metallicus (new synonymy). Species of Thoron are only known to parasitize the eggs of Nepidae (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) with rearings from Nepa Linnaeus and association with Curicta Stål; apparently the genus Ranatra Fabricius is not a host.

A number of genera of the family Scelionidae (Platygas- troidea) are also associated with such habi- tats, with the females searching for hosts near or even under water. Where known, these species parasitize the eggs of aquatic Heter- optera and Odonata, with documented rear- ing records of hosts in the families Gerridae, Nepidae, and Aeshnidae. The genus Thoron 2 NO. 3452AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES Haliday was one of the first genera of sce- lionids to be described (Haliday, 1833), and the parasitism of nepid eggs was first estab- lished by Ferrière (1916) and Henriksen (1918). At least eight genera of scelionids worldwide are known to be aquatic in habits. These groups may be commonly encoun- tered, even in North America and Europe, but little is known of their diversity or biol- ogy. In common with all groups of parasitic Hymenoptera, large parts of the world have not been well collected. As a result, we con- sider this paper to be a modest step in the exploration of this fascinating and unusual niche. MATERIALS This work is based specimens in the fol- lowing collections: AEIC D.B.

Type: Neothoron lautus Masner, by mon- otypy and original designation. NEW SYNONYMY. Masner (1972) proposed Neothoron and distinguished it from Thoron principally on the basis of the longer postmarginal vein in N. lautus. Later, Masner and Huggert (1979) referred to additional differences in the struc- ture of the propodeum, the armature of the dorsellum, and the position of the lateral ocelli. With a substantially greater number of both specimens and species presently before us, we find that none of the character states above serves as a distinguishing character between Neothoron and Thoron. The dis- tance of the lateral ocellus from the inner or- bit varies from less than one diameter to more than two diameters, and it principally distinguishes only T. metallicus Haliday. The length of the postmarginal vein intergrades from being nearly absent to being distinctly longer than the stigmal vein. Species with a long postmarginal vein may have the pro- podeum deeply excavate. Similarly, most species that would be classified in Neothoron have the dorsellum clearly armed. We con- clude that these character states are not cor- related and thus cannot justify the recogni- tion of two genera. We currently cannot effectively argue whether Neothoron represents a monophylet- ic group. The internal pattern of phylogenetic relationships in the family is poorly under- stood, and it is unclear which group of par- asitic Hymenoptera should be considered the sister of Platygastroidea. The elongate post- marginal vein of Neothoron is commonly found among scelionids, but this cannot be construed as convincing evidence that Neo- thoron is paraphyletic. The best cladistic rea- son to synonymize the two names is that to- day, even with much greater sampling around the world, Thoron sensu stricto re- mains monobasic. Our conclusion is that Neothoron is a junior synonym of Thoron (new synonymy). GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION: Thoron is a widely distributed, but not cosomopolitan ge- nus (fig. 1). One species, T. metallicus, is found in the eastern United States and Can- ada; Europe, from Ireland east to central Russia; and in northern Tunisia. A single species, T. dayi, has been collected from In- donesia. Thoron longicornis is known only from the Huachuca Mountains of southeast- ern Arizona. Six species are found from Pan- ama to southeastern Brazil, and three of these are sympatric in Bolivia. BIOLOGY: The only species of Thoron for which the biology is relatively well known is T. metallicus. This Holarctic species has 2004 3JOHNSON AND MASNER: REVISION OF THORON F ig . 1.

(Ferrière, 1916; Henriksen, 1918) in Europe. The only species of Nepa in the United States and Canada is Nepa apiculata Uhler, known from southern Québec and Ontario, west to Manitoba and North Dakota, and south to Kansas and Georgia (Sites and Pol- hemus, 1994). This roughly corresponds with the distribution of T. metallicus in the New World (fig. 1). It seems likely that N. api- culata is the host in the Nearctic, although no rearings have been made. Thoron metallicus appears to be a univol- tine species that is particularly long-lived in the adult stage. Eggs of its presumed host in the New World, Nepa apiculata, are present from mid-May to mid-June in southern Illi- nois (McPherson and Packauskas, 1987). Male specimens have been collected from June to September in the USA and Canada and from July to September in Europe (one male specimen from Tunisia was collected in April). In contrast, females have been col- lected from April to October and even as ear- ly in the year as March in Sweden (598319N). We interpret these data to mean that the adult wasps emerge from the host in midsummer and that the females overwinter and then at- tack newly laid waterscorpion eggs the fol- lowing year. Specimens of Thoron longicornis were collected in numbers in the Huachuca Moun- tains of Arizona in association with nymphs and adults of Curicta pronotata Kuitert. The genus Curicta Stål, recently revised by Kef- fer (1996), has 16 species in the New World. Nepa does not occur in the Neotropics. We speculate that Curicta is the probable host of Neotropical Thoron because of the similarity in size and biology with Nepa. There appear to be no records of Thoron attacking the widespread and relatively com- mon genus Ranatra Fabricius in the Nearctic. This may well be due to a difference in ovi- position habits: Nepa and Curicta generally lay their eggs in sand or mud along the shoreline, with the egg’s respiratory horns protruding into the open air (McPherson and Packauskas, 1987; Keffer et al., 1994). Ran- atra, in contrast, places its eggs within the tissue of aquatic vegetation, again with the respiratory horns protruding into the air (Menke, 1979). We have only a single specimen of Thoron from the Old World outside of Europe, Rus- sia, and the Caucasus, described here as T. dayi from Indonesia, yet the Nepidae are most diverse in the tropics of Africa and Asia. This leads us to predict that the Old World may yet harbor numerous undescribed species of Thoron or its close relatives. Most of the specimens of Thoron rivalis were collected in the cerrado of central Bra- zil along a small permanent stream at the end of the dry season. The first rain that season fell on October 1 (1995), but specimens of both sexes of the wasp were collected in the days preceding that event. RELATIONSHIPS: Kozlov (1970) proposed a new higher classification of the Scelionidae, dividing it into four subfamilies (Scelioninae, Teleasinae, Telenominae, and Baeinae) and 17 tribes. Of particular relevance for this dis- cussion, Kozlov described as new the tribe Psilanteridini (six genera, Scelioninae) and the monobasic tribes Thoronini (Baeinae), Tiphodytini (Telenominae), and Pseudanter- idini (Scelioninae). The monophyly of Psi- lanteridini was based on the explicit recog- nition of a single apomorphic character, the presence of a skaphion on the mesonotum. Masner (1972) correctly noted that a ska- phion is present as well in the other tribes, and, further, that those three are all associated with aquatic habitats. He placed the three, together with the new genera Neothoron, Mi- crothoron Masner, Tanaodytes Masner, and Thoronella Masner, in a single tribe, Thoron- ini, within the Scelioninae. Thoronidea Mas- ner and Huggert was later described and add- ed to the thoronine cast of characters (Mas- ner and Huggert, 1979). We now view the proposed monophyly of Thoronini with some skepticism. The basis for the hypothesis was primarily the structure of the female clava; the long, stiff bristles on the mesosoma; and the smooth surface of the body. Austin and Field (1997) demonstrated that one of the genera, Thoronella, possesses a complex apomorphic character complex, the Scelio-type tubular ovipositor. This strongly suggests to us that it should be re- moved from the Thoronini. Carlow (1992) discovered that Thoronella adults are phor- etic on dragonflies. It therefore seems plau- sible to us that the character states used to 2004 5JOHNSON AND MASNER: REVISION OF THORON define Thoronini may well be convergent and somehow associated with underwater behav- ior, respiration, and locomotion of the adult wasps. There are no known species of Thoron in subsaharan Africa, none in most of tropical Asia, and none in far eastern Asia (Russian Far East, Korea, or Japan). The genus El- gonia Risbec is highly reminiscent of Thoron in both structural details and overall habitus. Species of this genus have been collected in both tropical Africa and Asia in pan traps in aquatic environments, including habitats rich in nepids. Elgonia is distinguished from Tho- ron by its abrupt, six-segmented female an- tennal clava, with all clavomeres separated; male antennal segment 5 carinate and with a small basal, ventral excavation (the sex-seg- ment); metasomatic T3 is densely punctate; and the lower portion of the metapleuron above the hindcoxa is setose. We are con- tinuing to investigate the question of the re- lationships of Thoron as a component of an- other, broader study, now in progress.

This single specimen is, in our opinion, an unusual spe- cies, but one that clearly falls within the lim- its of the genus Thoron. Its disjunct distri- bution strongly suggests to us that there are more species yet to be discovered along calm watercourses in tropical Asia.

Thoron longicornis Masner and Huggert Figures 8, 16 Thoron longicornis Masner and Huggert, 1979: 915. Original description. Sarazin, 1986: 975 (type information). DESCRIPTION: Length 2.9 mm. Female A4 distinctly shorter than A3; clava robust, 3.4 times longer than wide; apex of A1 distinctly extending above top of head (lateral view with A1 in flexed position, fig. 8); female A2–A4 reddish brown, A5–A7 brown; male A11 1.6–1.8 times as long as wide; ocelli moderately large, lateral ocellus separated from inner orbit by approximately one di- ameter of posterior ocellus; central portion of mesoscutum and scutellum at most with mi- nute setigerous punctures; notaulus long, ex- tending anteriorly beyond level of posterior margin of tegula, deeply crenulate (fig. 16); mesoscutum with both long bristles and shorter underlying pilosity; metapleuron sparsely setose anteriorly, posterior portion of metapleuron and lateral face of propo- deum nearly glabrous; marginalis not thick- ened, as wide as submarginal or basal portion of stigmal vein; postmarginal vein extremely short or absent, much shorter than length of stigmal vein; with massive, strong medial spine, sharply pointed; dorsal surface of pro- podeum not excavate; coxae yellowish brown, with base darker than apex; hindfe- mur almost entirely honey-yellow to yellow, concolorous with apex of coxa; T1 without hump, longitudinally costate throughout; costae on T2 reaching at least to posterior third of tergite; T2 distinctly shorter than T3; T3 wider than long. DIAGNOSIS: This species shares with T. rex the elongate scape, clearly extending beyond the vertex. It differs from that species, and all other species treated here, in the deep and strongly crenulate notauli. MATERIAL EXAMINED: Holotype female: UNIT- ED STATES: Arizona, Huachuca Mts., Ramsey Canyon, 25 km S Serra Vista, 1820 m, vi.1967, malaise trap set across creek in a narrow gully, R.F. Sternitzky (CNC type no. 15598). Other ma- terial: UNITED STATES: Arizona, Cochise Co., Huachuca Mts., Ramsey Cyn., 1820 m, 20.viii– 10.ix.1990, L. Masner, yellow pan traps along creek, below pool, 13/, 55? (including OSUC 77436, 77437). COMMENTS: The nepid Curicta pronotata was also found in numbers in the same creek as this species and, presumably, is its host. This waterscorpion is also known from Sa- bina Canyon in Arizona and northwestern Mexico: these may be likely areas to find ad- ditional populations of this parasitoid. A second species of waterscorpion, Cur- icta scorpio Stål, is found in Lousiana and Texas, south to Nicaragua (Keffer, 1996). This suggests that there may be another spe- cies of Thoron in that region, an area in which we have seen no specimens of Thoron.

Female A4 subequal A3, just barely longer than A5 (fig. 2); clava robust, 2.9 times longer than wide; apex of A1 well below top of vertex; female A2–A7 dark brown; male A11 1.6–1.8 times as long as wide; ocelli small, lateral ocellus separated from inner orbit by at least slightly less than twice its diameter (figs. 4, 5); cen- tral portion of mesoscutum and scutellum at most with minute setigerous punctures; no- taulus long, almost percurrent (fig. 3), ex- tending anteriorly beyond level of posterior margin of tegula, simple, without crenulae; mesoscutum with both long bristles and shorter underlying pilosity; metapleuron and lateral face of propodeum uniformly covered with long, silvery hairs (figs. 2, 11); margin- alis thickened, and surrounding membrane deeply pigmented; postmarginal vein ex- tremely short or absent, much shorter than length of stigmal vein; dorsellum spinose medially, short, subtriangular; dorsal surface of propodeum excavate medially; all coxae dark brown to black; hindfemur light brown, lighter in color than dark coxa; T1 with strong, smooth hump, sometimes low, not strongly raised; costae on T2 reaching at least to posterior third of tergite; T2 distinct- ly shorter than T3; T3 wider than long. DIAGNOSIS: Thoron metallicus is distin- guished from all other species by its pilose metapleuron, the small ocelli (POL 1.5–23 OD), the short postmarginalis, and the en- larged area of pigmentation around the mar- ginal vein.

Some specimens (fig. 4) have the gena subparallel or even slightly bulging so that the head is widest across the genae and not across the compound eyes. In contrast, other specimens, collected at the same time and place (e.g., in the Czech Republic), have the genae distinctly receding immediately behind the compound eyes (fig. 5). All specimens from Britain and from the Nearctic region have expanded temples. Extreme dimor- phism in male morphology is known in the Scelionidae (e.g., Johnson, 1984), and this variation may be a more subtle expression of the same phenomenon. We have not been able to locate specimens of Thoron gibbus described by Ruthe. He distinguished his species from T. metallicus based on differences in the antennal clava. In all respects, as far as we can tell from the published data, the description is consistent with T. metallicus. Ruthe’s material was col- lected near Berlin, in moist habitats, and the species was not uncommon. Because the ex- tensive material of Thoron from Europe con- sists of only a single species, we propose that Thoron gibbus is a junior synonym of T. me- tallicus (new synonymy). Thoron rex, new species Figure 18 DESCRIPTION: Length 2.0 mm. Female A4 subequal to or shorter than A3; clava robust, 2.9 times longer than wide; apex of A1 dis- tinctly extending above top of head (lateral view with A1 in flexed position); female A2 brown, A3–A4 bright yellow, ocelli moder- ately large, lateral ocellus separated from in- ner orbit by approximately one diameter of posterior ocellus; contrasting with dark brown A5–A7; central portion of mesoscu- tum and scutellum at most with minute se- tigerous punctures (fig. 18); notaulus very short, not extending anteriorly to level of 14 NO. 3452AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES posterior margin of tegula, simple, without crenulae; mesoscutum with only long semi- erect bristles and no micropilosity; metapleu- ron sparsely setose anteriorly, posterior por- tion of metapleuron and lateral face of pro- podeum nearly glabrous; marginalis not thickened, as wide as submarginal or basal portion of stigmal vein; postmarginal vein clearly developed, longer than stigmal vein; dorsellum unarmed medially; dorsal surface of propodeum excavate medially; all coxae yellow; hindfemur almost entirely honey-yel- low to yellow, concolorous with apex of coxa; T1 without hump, longitudinally cos- tate throughout; costae on T2 reaching at least to posterior third of tergite; T2 distinct- ly shorter than T3; T3 wider than long. Male unknown. ETYMOLOGY: From the Latin, rex, meaning king, emphasizing its similarity with T. dux.

Female A4 subequal to or shorter than A3; clava robust, 3.5 times longer than wide (fig. 6); apex of A1 at same level as top of head (lateral view with A1 in flexed position); female A2–A7 dark brown; male A11 2.0–2.3 times longer than wide; ocelli large, lateral ocellus sepa- rated from inner orbit by one-half diameter of posterior ocellus; central portion of me- soscutum and scutellum at most with minute setigerous punctures; notaulus long, extend- ing anteriorly beyond level of posterior mar- gin of tegula; metapleuron sparsely setose anteriorly, posterior portion of metapleuron and lateral face of propodeum nearly gla- brous; marginalis not thickened, as wide as submarginal or basal portion of stigmal vein; postmarginal vein clearly developed, longer than stigmal vein; dorsellum spinose medi- ally, short, subtriangular; dorsal surface of propodeum not excavate; all coxae yellow; hindfemur partly to entirely dark brown; T1 without hump (fig. 12), longitudinally costate throughout; costae on T2 reaching at least to posterior third of tergite; T2 as long as or slightly longer than T3; T3 wider than long. DIAGNOSIS: Most similar to T. garciai, dis- tinguished from it by the darkened hindfe- mora in the male, T3 subequal to or longer than T2, and the more elongate female an- tennal clava. ETYMOLOGY: From the Latin rivalis, mean- ing of a stream, referring to its association with a small permanent stream at the type locality.

Apex of A1 well below top of vertex; male A11 2.4–2.6 times as long as wide; ocelli large, lateral ocellus separated from inner orbit by one- half diameter of posterior ocellus; central portion of mesoscutum and scutellum at most with minute setigerous punctures; notaulus moderately long, but only reaching anterior margin of tegula, simple, without crenulae; mesoscutum with both long bristles and shorter underlying pilosity; metapleuron sparsely setose anteriorly, posterior portion of metapleuron and lateral face of propo- deum nearly glabrous; marginalis not thick- ened, as wide as submarginal or basal portion of stigmal vein; postmarginal vein clearly de- veloped, longer than stigmal vein; dorsellum with long, slender, spinelike needle medially (fig. 13); dorsal surface of propodeum not excavate; all coxae yellow; hindfemur partly to entirely dark brown; costae on T2 short, reaching only to middle of tergite (fig. 14); T2 as long as T3; T3 wider than long. Female unknown. DIAGNOSIS: Distinguished from other spe- cies of Thoron by the long and acute dorsel- lar spine and the short costae on T2. ETYMOLOGY: From the Latin, spinifer, bearing a spine, referring to the elongate me- tanotal armature. MATERIAL EXAMINED: Holotype male: ECUA- DOR: Napo, Puerto Misahuallı́, 250 m, 18– 22.ii.1983, M. Sharkey, OSUC 77477 (CNC type no. 22866). COMMENTS: The presence of the elongate metanotal spine in the male leads us to pre- dict that female, when discovered, is unlikely to have T1 expanded into a basal horn or hump.
