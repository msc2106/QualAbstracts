ABSTRACT: 
We test whether significant differences in mental illness exist in a matched sample of lone- and group-based terrorists. We then test whether there are distinct behavioral differences between lone-actor terrorists with and without mental illness. We then stratify our sample across a range of diagnoses and again test whether significant differences exist. We conduct a series of bivariate, multivariate, and multinomial statistical tests using a unique dataset of 119 lone-actor terrorists and a matched sample of group-based terrorists. The odds of a lone-actor terrorist having a mental illness is 13.49 times higher than the odds of a group actor having a mental illness. Lone actors who were mentally ill were 18.07 times more likely to have a spouse or partner who was involved in a wider movement than those without a history of mental illness. Those with a mental illness were more likely to have a proximate upcoming life change, more likely to have been a recent victim of prejudice, and experienced proximate and chronic stress. The results identify behaviors and traits that security agencies can utilize to monitor and prevent lone-actor terrorism events. The correlated behaviors provide an image of how risk can crystalize within the individual offender and that our understanding of lone-actor terrorism should be multivariate in nature.

The odds ratio (0.98, 95% CI: 0.454,2.125) indicates the null hypothesis should be accepted, and pre-vious nonstatistical conclusions in the literature should be inter-preted cautiously.Hypothesis 4: Lone actors with a history of mental illness aremore likely to have encountered stressors than those with norecorded mental illness.Here, we tested variables including whether the individual had(a) divorced parents, (b) previous military experience, (c) becomerecently unemployed, (d) a history of substance abuse, (e) expe-rienced a significant work-related stressor, (f) a proximate life goalinterrupted, (g) experienced being degraded or disrespected byothers, (h) experienced being the target of an act of prejudice, (i)experienced being the victim of physical or verbal assault, (j)recent personal relationship problem, (k) recent financial prob-lems, (l) recently been under an elevated level of stress, (m)experienced long-term sources of stress, and (n) about to experi-ence a proximate upcoming life change.Some significant associations were found between mental ill-ness and the experience of stressors.

Through the 1970sstudies emphasized pathological explanations that posited thecompulsion to join a terrorist group, or the vulnerability to recruit-ment, is inherent in those engaged in militancy. To this end,researchers postulated deviant characteristics of the terrorist per-sonality. Through the 1980s, psychoanalytical approaches con-cluded that terrorists were not the aggressive psychopaths por-trayed to the public, but are hesitant, emotionally damaged youthswho are victims of parental rejection that delayed their achieve-ment of adult identity (Victoroff, 2005). Studies that emergedthrough the late 1990s and early 2000s dismissed these approacheson methodological and empirical grounds (Borum, 2004; Horgan,2005; Victoroff, 2005).A consensus soon emerged that group dynamics were key tounderstanding terrorist motivation. For example, one academic,who in the past championed psychoanalytical interpretations ofterrorist motivation, argued that “a clear consensus exists that itis not individual psychology, but group, organizational andsocial psychology, that provides the greatest analytical power inunderstanding this complex phenomenon” (Post, 2005, p. 7).This consensus was largely shaped through improved datacollection and primary interviews that refuted the above diag-noses. For example, research carried out on the Irish RepublicanArmy (IRA), Northern Ireland loyalists, Hezbollah, Germanterrorists, the National Liberation Front (FLN), Basque Home-land and Liberty (ETA), Colombian terrorists, global jihadists,and captured Palestinian terrorists has provided evidence thatgroup-based terrorists are psychologically quite normal (Cren-shaw, 1981; Ferguson, Burgess, & Hollywood, 2008; Heskin,1984; Merari, 1998; Post, Sprinzak, & Denny, 2003; Rasch,1979; Reinares, 2007; Sageman, 2005). Typically the popula-tion of recruits does not tend to be psychopathological, or forthat matter highly uneducated and impoverished because of aselection effect. Organizational elites seek to recruit those mostcapable of undertaking assigned tasks. Most tasks require anelement of secrecy, calibrated violence, and technologicalknow-how. Educated, psychologically healthy, and normal vol-unteers tend to be preferred for this particular reason. It wasargued that those who seek to join but display signs of mentalillness may be weeded out in the selection process (Silke,2003).The role of mental illness and personality became so com-pletely downplayed that one noted expert recently stated: “wealso tried to distinguish terrorists from violent lunatics. Crazies,by definition, could not be terrorists” (Jenkins, 2013, p. 9). Inother words, an act of targeted violence is either the action of arational terrorist or an irrational mentally unstable civilian.Over the space of 40 years of research on terrorist motivationthe literature has jumped from one extreme position (“they areall mentally ill”) to the exact opposite (“by definition, a terroristcannot be mentally ill”). This is also reflected in some majorcriminological research. For example, Gottfredson and Hirs-chi’s control theory views “regular criminals” as impulsive,whereas terrorists need higher levels of control and are implic-itly more calculating and, therefore, less likely to be mentallyill. In reality, such distinctions are probably less clear-cut.

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.false dichotomy may exist that categorizes violent individualsas either a rational terrorist or an irrational and unstable indi-vidual.This false dichotomy may be driven by two factors—a misun-derstanding of rationality and the focus on group-based actors.Some studies have shown that individuals with mental illness candisplay rational motivations. For example, Gill, Horgan, and Deck-ert (2014) illustrate that lone-actor terrorists diagnosed with mentalillness frequently display rational motives. Similarly, Borum(2013) highlights a number of terrorists with mental illness whowere capable of sophisticated attack planning. In an operationalstudy of assassins, attackers and near-lethal approachers, Fein andVossekuil (1999), highlight cases of mentally ill individuals plan-ning and executing behaviors as effectively as those lacking diag-nosis.The few existing empirical studies of lone-actor terrorism sug-gest there is a greater preponderance of mental illness within thiscategory of terrorist actor than that expected within a group-basedsample. Fein and Vossekuil (1999) found 61% of lone assassinshad previous contact with mental health services. Hewitt (2003)found 22% of American “loners” psychologically disturbed. Gill etal. (2014) found 31% of a sample of lone-actor terrorists to havea history of mental illness. In perhaps the methodologically mostsophisticated study, Gruenewald, Chermak, and Freilich (2013),compared a sample of lone extreme right-wing offenders with asample of group-based extreme right-wing offenders. Lone-offenders had a significantly higher rate of mental illness thangroup-offenders (40% vs. 7.6%).These findings suggest a need for revisiting the issue of mentalillness as a part of the process for some people becoming involvedin terrorism. Mental illness mechanisms remain systematicallyunexamined, and there may be grounds to pursue a more concreteunderstanding of how mental illness and psychological processesinfluence an individual’s participation in and trajectory throughterrorist behaviors (Gill & Corner, 2013). The wider criminologyliterature suggests that much promise exists in utilizing mentalillness as a central variable with relation to criminogenic factors.As Anderson (1997) explains, the symbiotic relationship betweenmental illness and criminal behavior is complex. Comorbidity ofmental illness with other behaviors is well documented across theliterature and include substance abuse (Todd et al., 2004) andviolent and criminal convictions (Anderson, 1997).Utilizing a unique dataset of 119 lone-actor terrorists and amatched sample of group-based terrorists we first replicate theGruenewald et al. (2013) study and test whether the significantdifferences in mental illness also hold true across a sample ofactors that contains ideological motivations other than far-rightextremism. We then partition our lone-actor sample into twocategories (those with and without mental illness diagnoses) andtest whether there are distinct characteristic, behavioral, or comor-bidity differences between them. Finally, instead of treating mentalillness diagnosis as a dichotomy (either you are mentally ill or not),we stratify our sample across a range of diagnoses and again testwhether there significant differences appear.TheoryMost empirical studies of lone-actor terrorism are largely de-scriptive, and highlight a number of counterintuitive findings. Thisarticle explores whether many of these counterintuitive findingsare related to the relatively large preponderance of individuals withmental illness diagnoses. Specifically we test a series of hypoth-eses related to selection effects, rationality, and stressors.Mental Illness and Selection EffectsA number of studies compare lone and group offenders across awide range of crimes. The results regarding mental illness aremixed. For example, Coid et al. (2013) concluded that gangmembers demonstrate higher levels of psychiatric morbidity thanlone offenders. On the other hand, Bijleveld and Hendriks’ (2003)found lone rapists to be significantly more likely to have problem-atic personality structures than group rapists. Hickle and Roe-Sepowitz (2010) found lone juvenile arsonists more often camefrom unstable homes, and experienced school difficulties, behav-ioral problems, negative emotions, and expressed suicidal thoughtsmore regularly. Hauffe and Porter (2009) suggest differing path-ological processes at play between lone and group offenders.In terms of terrorism-specific studies Gruenewald et al. (2013)compared far-right group and lone offenders, finding mental ill-ness prevalence differed across offender types (group offender,7.6%, and lone offender, 40.4%). Similarly, Hewitt (2003) de-scribes differences in prevalence of mental illness across terroristgroup and lone actors (8.1% compared with 22%). These resultssuggest psychopathological causation differs across terrorist type.This higher preponderance among lone-actor samples may bebecause of processes that the group-based terrorism literature haslong hypothesized. Individuals displaying these traits will not beselected for recruitment. For example, Bueno de Mesquita (2005)utilizes a game theoretic model to demonstrate differences be-tween recruits and sympathisers to terrorist causes. The rationalebeing that organizations screen recruits to select the most compe-tent to become cadres. Similarly, Horgan (2005) notes that partic-ular individuals may never meet recruitment criteria because ofovert psychological characteristics rendering them unsuitable.Spaaij (2010) explains that because of psychological conditions,certain individuals fail to become recruited despite demonstratingwillingness, and act independently instead.Hypothesis 1: Lone-actor terrorists will demonstrate a higherprevalence of mental illness than group-based terrorist actors.Following the above discussion, we may expect that lone-actorterrorists have previously tried to join a group. Given the temporaland dynamic nature of mental illness, we may also expect thatparticipating group members who later display these traits will beejected from the group. It is consequently hypothesized:Hypothesis 2: There will be a difference between mentally illand nonmentally ill lone actors concerning group entry, par-ticipation and removal.The above hypotheses presuppose that attitudinal affinity to acause leads individuals to seek recruitment into a group of coideo-logues. Social movement theorists, however, argue that structuralavailability is holds greater explanatory power than attitudinalaffinity. In other words, predisposition to join a terrorist group isof little use if the would-be-terrorist does not possess the structuralopportunities to join. Social movement research illustrates the24 CORNER AND GILLThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.crucial role of structural and network factors in addition to indi-vidual attitudinal factors in motivating one toward activism (Mc-Adam, 1986). Looking at existing research on lone actor terroristsand other analogous offender types, a common finding is that alarge proportion of these samples are socially isolated individualswho, therefore, may not have the interpersonal connections with apotential recruiter. For example, the Gill et al. (2014) study oflone-actor terrorists characterized 52.9% of the sample as sociallyisolated. Meloy, Hempel, Mohandie, Shiva, and Gray (2001) de-scribe 70% of their subset of adolescent mass murderers as lonersand outcasts among peers. Among Fein and Vossekuil’s (1999)cohort of assassins, “most” were illustrated as social isolates.Bijeveld and Hendriks (2003) investigation of sex offenders con-cluded that solo offenders (compared with group) score signifi-cantly lower on sociability. When we also consider that otherstudies have found a link between social isolation and mentalillness (Elisha, Castle, & Hocking, 2006; Thoits, 1983), we hy-pothesize that:Hypothesis 3: Mentally ill lone actors are more likely to becharacterized as socially isolated than those who are nonmen-tally ill.StressorsFarrington (1986) presents a general stress model; which hy-pothesizes that stress is dependent upon the discrepancy betweenthe requirement posed by the stressor stimulus and the copingbehaviors utilized from the individual’s response capacities. Muchof the criminology literature reports that the mentally ill are moresusceptible to negative reactions to stressors. For example, Kend-ler, Karkowski, and Prescott (1999) investigated the impact ofstressors on the onset of major depression, concluding there to bea significant causal relationship, and noting individuals predis-posed to major depression place themselves into high-risk envi-ronments. Roberts, McLaughlin, Conron, and Koenen (2011) citeMcLaughlin et al. (2010) who concluded that stress sensitizationincreases the likelihood of mental illness following exposure totraumatic stressors. Borum et al. (2012) also note that symptoms ofmental illness are sometimes not evident, except under continuedstress. Situational explanations of crime contend that althoughlonger-term risk factors (in this case stress sensitization) maycause higher predisposition to engage in criminal and violentbehaviors, it is the shorter term risk factors (proximate stressors)that act as precursors to the actual commission of the crime. Gillet al.’s (2014) work on lone-actor terrorism supports this. Theyargue that although it is important to consider distal risk factors,shorter term risk factors are more operationally significant. Of the32.8% of lone actors who were impacted by stressors in theirsample, 74.3% experienced those 12 months preceding the attack.This process has also been highlighted in a number of analogousstudies. Meloy et al. (2004) found 59% of their adolescent massmurderer sample experienced a “trigger” event hours or daysbefore the murders. Hickle and Roe-Sepowitz’s (2010) research onjuvenile arsonists found executors were more likely to “be incrisis,” having suffered a major stressor such as the death of aparent, incidence of abuse, pregnancy, or suicide attempt. In 12 ofFein and Vossekuil’s (1999) 20 case studies, multiple stressors inthe individual’s recent lives were present. They concluded that nosubject investigated was leading an exemplary life, defined bysuccess in work and family. For almost all of the subjects theirattack occurred after a downward spiral. For numerous subjects,one or several stressors appeared to trigger the process that led tothe assassination behavior. McCauley et al. (2013) comparedschool attackers and assassins, finding evidence of stressors inboth cohorts (98% and “nearly half,” respectively).Agnew’s (2010) general strain theory of terrorism infers thosewho act within a group experience collective strains (stressors)seen as undeserved, caused by those with greater perceived powerand great in magnitude. Such stressors provoke action. However,Agnew concedes group involvement also aids alleviation of suchstressors. Group membership provides outlets for rage and discon-tent brought forth by strains, inadvertently lessening their adverseeffects. Lone actors do not possess the support structure to reducethese stressors, and the above evidence provides explanation forthe conclusions of Gill et al. (2014); Gruenewald et al. (2013), andHewitt (2003).However, not all lone actors have a history of mental illness, soit is necessary to determine if differences in experience of stressorsacross actors exist. Despite abundant statistical evidence concern-ing stressors among both mentally ill and nonmentally ill perpe-trators of violence shown above; it is yet to be whether those withmental illness are more likely to encounter stressors and react tothem than those who are nonmentally ill. Given the findingsrelated to high-volume crimes, we hypothesize:Hypothesis 4: Lone actors with a history of mental illness aremore likely to have encountered stressors than those with norecorded mental illness.Irrationality and ViolenceAs mentioned previously, recent research demonstrates that thesupposed irrationality experienced by the mentally ill is not asdebilitating as previously thought (Borum et al., 2012; Gill et al.,2014; Fein & Vossekuil, 1999). Borum (2013) elucidates: “If thesubject . . . been given some diagnostic label, then there is acommon tendency to regard that label as a master explanation ofthe subject’s thinking, motives and behavior. It is not.” Theseassertions, however, are largely based on descriptive statistics orillustrative case studies and remain statistically untested.Furthermore, there is little understanding as to whether thesetypes of actors differ in their ability to successfully carry out aviolent attack. The study of the linkages between mental illnessand violence has a long history (Teplin, 1984). The Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revi-sion (DSM–IV–TR) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) ex-plains that across psychiatric disorders the risk of violence in-creases comparable to that of the general population. Ouzir (2013)argues that impulsivity (that is associated with many mental ill-nesses) and reactive violence largely explain this increased risk ofviolence. On the other hand, Hiday (1995) and Scott and Resnick(2006) argue those who are mentally ill to be no more dangerousthan the general population. These issues have also not beenapplied in a systematic sense to the types of violence associatedwith terrorist activity apart from James et al. (2007), who foundthat mentally ill perpetrators of attacks on European politiciansengaged in higher levels of violence.25A FALSE DICHOTOMY?This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.Hypothesis 5: Lone actors with a history of mental illness areno more likely to display irrational attack planning behaviorsthan those with no diagnosis.Hypothesis 6: Lone actors with a history of mental illness aremore violent than those with no diagnosis.Mental Illness Across a SpectrumTo expand the terrorist literature it is necessary to expand thedichotomous thinking an individual is either mentally ill or not.Different disorders display different symptoms (DSM–IV–TR,American Psychiatric Association, 2000; International StatisticalClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-10th re-vision (ICD-10), World Health Organization, 2010). By viewingactions displayed by a terrorist as either mentally ill or not, theliterature becomes stagnant and prevention methods are not aseffective as possible. Psychiatric literature often focuses uponlevels of violence, demonstrated by numerous studies. Antisocialpersonality disorder is associated with violence (DSM–IV–TR,American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Fazel and Danesh(2002) describe how this disorder is often seen in prison settings.In a review of 13 investigations concerning violence in mentally illsubjects, Schizophrenia was concluded as being the most reliableindicator, followed by personality disorders and those with organicbrain trauma. (Krakowski, Volavka, & Brizer, 1986). Shaw et al.(2006) provide evidence for differing prevalence rates of mentalillnesses across individuals convicted of homicide. Swanson, Hol-zer, Ganju, and Jono (1990) concluded different disorders presentdifferent levels of violence, ranging from phobias (lowest) to drugdependence (highest). This investigation aims to determine if,alongside violence, other variables previously discussed differacross disorders. Therefore, the hypothesis formulated is:Hypothesis 7: There will be differences in variables acrossdisorders in the cohort.It is also important to consider comorbidity across psychiatricdiagnoses. Saxe et al. (1993) found patients who met criteria fordissociative disorder were significantly more likely to suffer frommajor depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and borderline person-ality disorder. Kessler, Chiu, Demler, and Walters (2005) explain;comorbidity of disorders is not as common as being diagnosedwith one disorder, but the most severe and pervasive cases areconcentrated in the highly comorbid. Singleton et al. (1998) found76% of those with a mental illness in the prison population to bediagnosed with two or more disorders. In a more recent epidemi-ological survey, Elbogen and Johnson (2009) concluded comor-bidity of disorders to be a reliable predictor of violence incidence.Abram and Teplin (1991) suggest this pattern is because thecomplex needs of those with multiple diagnoses make them diffi-cult to place in treatment facilities, and they are arrested as a formof disorder management. Taking into account this evidence it ishypothesized:Hypothesis 8: There will be differences in variables acrosscomorbid disorders in the cohort.Data and MethodThe sample includes an extensive codebook from Gill et al.’s(2014) dataset of 119 lone-actor terrorists. Actors were eitherconvicted or died in the commission of their offense in the UnitedStates and Europe since 1990. The sample includes violent andnonviolent behaviors carried out by individuals and isolated dyadswho either self-radicalized, or radicalized via a larger organizationand then carried out acts external to command and control links.Profiles were built using the LexisNexis archive of open sourceinformation, scholarly articles, and public record depositories, andthe codebook includes 185 variables concerning sociodemographi-cal information, antecedent, event and postevent specific behav-iors.To compare group and lone actors, we also created a sample ofgroup terrorist actors. The observations were sourced from Sim-cox, Stuart, Ahmed, Murray, and Carlile (2011) and Mother Jones(2013), which contain open source profiles on U.S. and non-U.S.terror-based activities since September 11, 2001. A systematicstratified sampling methodology was utilized to gather the sampleof 119 group terrorist actors. The data were matched to the loneactor sample through the country of attack variable (55 U.S. and 64non-U.S.). This variable was selected to reflect differing psychi-atric practices with concerns to law enforcement (James et al.,2007). Group actors were chosen based on confirmed affiliationswith organizations, and incarceration not including deportation.Once outliers were excluded there was a sample of 142 non-U.S.group actors and a sample of 286 U.S. group actors. Each actorwas assigned a random number (generated using  RAND func-tion in Excel) and using a systematic method (k  p/n); in thisinstance k  observation, p  population, and n  sample size.Sampling intervals were generated (2.22 for actions non-U.S.countries and 5.2 for U.S.) and a sample containing 55 U.S. actorsand 64 non-U.S. actors was produced (SMART, 2012, p. 9). Usingthe same extensive search tools as the Gill et al. (2014) study, wecoded variables related to mental health issues for each of thechosen group-based actors.Gill et al.’s (2014) codebook examined mental illness as adichotomous variable. We created additional variables includingthe number and name of diagnoses and diagnostic categories.These variables were developed after extensive examination of theavailable literature on each actor. Available literature was sourcedfrom the Lexis Nexus database, sworn affidavits, indictments,manifestos, warrants, trail proceeding transcripts, trial memoran-dums, government and expert witness reports, and competencyevaluations. The diagnosis name was located in the literature, andreliability and quality of the source was taken into account. Forexample, one actor was coded as suffering from Asperger’s anddepression (cited in trial proceedings); however, a newspaperarticle citing a “friend” (neighbor) as saying they suffered fromschizophrenia was discounted, as there was no further evidence forthis in any of the other sources concerning said actor. To ascertainthe number of diagnoses the same process was carried out. Diag-nostic categories were noted either from a confirmed diagnosis inarticles, or from a series of symptoms that were cross-referencedwith diagnostic material, and given a provisional diagnosis (ICD-10, World Health Organization, 2010). For those actors wherespecific diagnoses were not available and no symptoms provided(e.g., the literature on one actor gave no confirmed diagnoses butconfirmed that a mandatory treatment order was given) the out-comes were recorded and it was recorded the actor to have onediagnosis and a diagnostic code of 11 (nonspecific). The ICD-10diagnostic categories are displayed in Table 1, and is utilized26 CORNER AND GILLThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

Whereas the rate of mental illness among the lone-actor samplewas 31.9%, the corresponding figure for the group-actor sample was3.4%. Kolmogorov-Smirnov calculated the percentage of loneactors with mental illness, D(119)  0.43, p  .001 and groupactors with mental illness, D(119)  0.54, p  .001 to be signif-icantly non-normal. Levene’s test demonstrated that for mentalillness, variances were significantly different between lone andgroup actors, F(1, 236)  284.804, p  .001. Because the dataviolated assumptions and are binary categorical, a 2 test wascompleted and odds ratio calculated. A 2 test demonstrated asignificant association between offender type (group or lone) andmental illness, 2(1)  33.422, p  .001. Based on the odds ratio,the odds of a lone actor having a mental illness is 13.49 (95%confidence interval [CI]: 4.630, 40) times higher than the odds ofa group actor having a mental illness.To compare lone actors with and without a history of mentalillness, we followed the procedures of Gruenewald et al. (2013).We first conducted a series of bivariate tests such as 2 analysesand, where appropriate, Fisher’s exact tests. Table 2 outlines thesignificant differences between these subsets. Variables displayingsignificant differences were then input into a binary logistic re-gression to determine the strength of their predictive value in termsof predicting whether the observation had a history of mentalillness or not. To determine whether variables have any predictivestrength when considering differing and multiple diagnoses, thesignificant variables from the binary logistic regression were uti-lized in a multinomial regression.Hypothesis 2: There will be a difference between mentally illand nonmentally ill lone actors concerning group entry, par-ticipation and removal.For Hypothesis 2, we compared our lone-actor subsamplesacross behavioral variables including whether (a) the individual’sspouse was part of a wider movement, (b) individual receivedTable 1ICD-10 Diagnostic CategoriesDiagnostic category Diagnoses or disordersF00-F09 OrganicF10-F19 Substance useF20-F29 Schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusionalF30-F39 MoodF40-F48 Neurotic, stress related, and somatoformF50-F59 Behavioral syndromes associated withphysiological and physical factorsF60-F69 PersonalityF70-F79 Intellectual disabilities (“mental retardation”)F80-F89 Disorders of psychological developmentF90-F98 Behavioral and emotional, onset in childhood,and adolescenceF99-F99 UnspecifiedTable 2Observed Percentages for Nonmentally Ill and Mentally Ill ActorsMentally ill Nonmentally illHypothesis 2Individual’s spouse or partner part of wider movement. 18.4% 1.2%Command and control links with others. 7.9% 21.0%Hypothesis 4Individual’s parents divorced. 31.6% 9.9%Proximate upcoming life change. 15.8% 6.2%In build up to event; individual experienced being target of prejudice. 28.9% 11.1%In build up to event; individual experienced being disrespected. 28.9% 14.8%Individual recently under elevated level of stress. 44.7% 27.2%Chronic stress in individual’s life. 34.2% 19.8%Hypothesis 5Recent increase in levels of physical activity. 21.1% 8.6%Individual had stockpile of weapons. 63.2% 40.7%Individual expressed desire to hurt others. 76.3% 58.0%Discriminate or nondiscriminate target? 73.7% 50.6%Individual claimed responsibility publicly. 53.3% 38.3%Hypothesis 6Individual engaged in violent behavior previous to terrorist event. 52.6 30.9%Violent attack carried out? 65.8% 44.4%Did the individual kill? 55.3% 24.7%Did the individual injure? 52.6% 25.9%Additional variablesSingle issue inspired individual. 28.9% 12.3%Born in United States. 63.2% 39.5%Held a Ph.D. 10.5% 2.5% p  .1.  p  .05.  p  .01.27A FALSE DICHOTOMY?This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

All other variablesrelated to this hypothesis presented nonsignificant results.Hypothesis 3: Mentally ill lone actors are more likely to becharacterized as socially isolated than those who are nonmen-tally ill.For this hypothesis, we tested a range of behaviors includingwhether the individual was (a) in a relationship, (b) unemployed,(c) living alone at the time of the event, and (d) characterized asbeing socially isolated. No variables demonstrated significant as-sociations. Of particular interest here is that the results indicate alack of association between mental illness and social isolation,2(1)  0.002, p  .963. The odds ratio (0.98, 95% CI: 0.454,2.125) indicates the null hypothesis should be accepted, and pre-vious nonstatistical conclusions in the literature should be inter-preted cautiously.Hypothesis 4: Lone actors with a history of mental illness aremore likely to have encountered stressors than those with norecorded mental illness.Here, we tested variables including whether the individual had(a) divorced parents, (b) previous military experience, (c) becomerecently unemployed, (d) a history of substance abuse, (e) expe-rienced a significant work-related stressor, (f) a proximate life goalinterrupted, (g) experienced being degraded or disrespected byothers, (h) experienced being the target of an act of prejudice, (i)experienced being the victim of physical or verbal assault, (j)recent personal relationship problem, (k) recent financial prob-lems, (l) recently been under an elevated level of stress, (m)experienced long-term sources of stress, and (n) about to experi-ence a proximate upcoming life change.Some significant associations were found between mental ill-ness and the experience of stressors. Those who have witnessedparental divorce are 4.21 (95% CI: 1.549, 11.452) times morelikely to be diagnosed with a mental illness, 2(1)  8.713, p .01. Several proximate stressors demonstrated significant associa-tions. Actors with a proximate upcoming life change are 2.85 (95%CI: 0.811, 10.014) times more likely to have a mental illness(Fisher’s test; p  .1). Those who experience prejudice are 3.26(95% CI: 1.216, 8.734) times more likely to have a mental illness,2(1)  5.885, p  .05, and those who experience disrespect are2.34 (95% CI: 0.923, 5.945) times more likely to have a mentalillness, 2(1)  3.313, p  .1. Individuals who experience currentstress are 2.17 (95% CI: 0.970, 4.858) times more likely to bediagnosed with a mental illness, 2(1)  3.627, p  .1, andindividuals who experience chronic stress are 2.13 (95% CI: 0.889,5.018) times more likely to have a mental illness, 2(1)  2.933,p  .1.Hypothesis 5: Lone actors with a history of mental illness areno more likely to display irrational attack planning behaviorsthan those with no diagnosis.Hypothesis 6: Lone actors with a history of mental illness aremore violent than those with no diagnosis.To test issues concerning rationality, we focused on variablesrelated to attack planning, attack commission, and postattack be-haviors. These included noting whether the individual (a) becameobsessed or fixated with a specific event or phenomena in theattack’s build-up, (b) expressed a desire to hurt others, (c) makeverbal statements about their intent/beliefs to friends/family/wideraudiences, (d) have others aware of their grievance or extremistideology, (e) have a history of violence before this terrorist inci-dent, (f) consumed propaganda of a wider movement or otherlone-actor, (g) sought legitimization from epistemic authority fig-ures for his or her actions, (h) increased levels of physical activityin the build-up to the event, (i) engaged in dry-runs, (j) stockpiledweapons, (k) successfully carried out an attack, (l) targeted dis-criminately or indiscriminately, (m) used multiple attack methods,(n) killed anybody, (o) injured anybody, or (p) provide a claim ofresponsibility.Those with a history of violence are 2.49 (95% CI: 1.127, 5.497)times more likely to have a mental illness, 2(1)  5.212, p  .05.Those who increase physical activity levels are 2.82 (95% CI:0.939, 8.465) times more likely have a mental illness (Fisher’s test;p  .1). Those who stockpile weapons are 2.49 (95% CI: 1.127,5.518) times more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness,2(1)  5.208, p  .05. Individuals who express a desire to hurtothers are 2.33 (95% CI: 0.978, 5.555) times more likely to havea mental illness, 2(1)  3.750, p  .1. Those whose target isdiscriminate are 2.73 (95% CI: 1.175, 6.348) times more likely tobe mentally ill, 2(1)  5.649, p  .05. Actors who carry out aviolent attack are 2.4 (95% CI: 1.079, 5.354) times more likely tohave a mental illness, 2(1) 4.717, p .05. Individuals who killin an attack are 3.77 (95% CI: 1.668, 8.510) times more likely tobe mentally ill, 2(1) 10.705, p .001. Actors who injure othersin an attack are also 3.18 (95% CI: 1.415, 7.120) times more likelyto have a mental illness, 2(1)  8.169, p  .01. Individuals whosubsequently claim responsibility publicly are twice as likely (95%CI: 0.913, 4.350) to be mentally ill, 2(1)  3.035, p  .1.Finally, we tested a series of other variables to see whethersignificant differences were apparent among the lone-actor terror-ist subgroups. Those who operate within the United States, hold aPh.D. and are motivated by single-issue causes are more likely tohave a history of mental illness. For obvious reasons, we decidedto keep these variables in the logistic regression below. Othervariables such as criminal history showed no significant differ-ence.To determine the probability that mental illness occurs in anindividual given a set of predictor variables, a binary logisticregression analysis was carried out. The logistic regression anal-ysis showed that in combination, the independent variables signif-icantly impacted upon mental illness, 2(20)  60.667, p  .001.The model correctly predicted 83.2% of responses.

Odds of greater than one indicate a positiverelationship between the predictor and dependent variable.These results illustrate a variety of variables with odds ratiossuggestive of an impact on mental illness. These variables includehaving a spouse or partner involved in a wider movement (65.53[95% CI: 3.726, 1149.388] times more likely to have a mentalillness), making a public claim of responsibility (2.86 [95% CI:0.590, 19.974] times more likely), injuring others in the attack(14.27 [95% CI: 1.880, 108.207] times more likely) having pre-vious history of violence (3.21 [95% CI: 0.852, 12.070] timesmore likely), stockpiling weapons (3.97 [95% CI: 1.202, 13.130]times more likely), witnessing parental divorce (6.02 [95% CI:1.221, 29.710] times more likely), experiencing an upcoming lifechange (7.04 [95% CI: 0.963, 51.445] times more likely), being avictim to an act of prejudice (4.37 [95% CI: 0.808, 23.593] timesmore likely) and experiencing chronic stress (3.75 [0.935, 15.037]times more likely).Hypothesis 7: There will be differences in variables acrossdisorders in the cohort.We ran a multinomial logistic regression to determine the prob-ability that different mental illnesses occur in individuals given aset of predictor variables (different manifestations of lone actorbehavior). The included diagnostic categories contained a sampleof at least three actors. The analysis showed that, in combination,the independent variables significantly impacted upon diagnosticcategory, 2(45) 110.530, p .001. Table 4 depicts an overviewof the results.These results illustrate there to be certain variables that have asignificant main effect on diagnostic category (more likely thanthose who do not perform a behavior). Following the odds ratios,individuals with a spouse or partner involved in terror are 22.2(95% CI; 0.704, 1000) times more likely to have a diagnosis ofschizophrenia (F20–29) and 250 (95% CI; 5.495, 13734.377)times more likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder (F30–39).Individuals who injure in an attack are 11.63 (95% CI; 2.092,66.600) times more likely like have schizophrenia and 41.6 (95%CI; 2.488, 1000) times more likely to have a mood disorder. Thosewho display prior violence are 5.15 (95% CI; 1.106, 24.390) timesmore likely to be schizophrenic.

Individuals whoexperience a proximate life change are 500 (95% CI; 5.435,31191.516) times more likely to have three or more diagnoses.Discussion and ConclusionsTogether the results illustrate the need to readjust our under-standing of terrorism and mental illness in a number of ways. First,the results suggest there is a stronger association between mentalillness and lone-actor terrorists than mental illness and group-based terrorists. This reflects the findings of Gruenewald et al.’s(2013) analysis of extreme right-wing offenders who have causedfatalities in the U.S. When we compared our lone actors with ahistory of mental illness to those without, we further found thatthose with a history were significantly less likely to have someform of command and control link. This further bolsters theargument that selection effects are at play. Future qualitativeresearch may focus upon the strategies deployed by terrorist re-cruiters in selecting new cadre. It is also important here to recog-nize the potential for selectivity bias with regard to using open-source data (Chermak et al., 2010). There is the possibility thatreporters are aware of the potential that lone actors are more likelymentally ill, investigate that avenue further and more rigorouslyand report their findings. As reported above, great care was takento source information from outside of newspaper reports and wereferred to hierarchy of credible sources in the case of conflictingreports. Future research may compare the rates of reporting ofmental illness within group actors in cases during the 1970s and1980s when the terrorist as mentally ill idea was salient to con-temporary cases to check whether such prevailing notions impactupon reporting procedures.Table4MultinomialLogisticRegressionVariableDiagnosticcategoryF20-29F30-39F40-48F60-69F80-89Individual’sspouseorpartnerpartofwidermovement.B3.090,Wald2 (1)3.099,p.1,95%CI[0.001,1.420]B5.616,Wald2 (1)7.921,p.01,95%CI[0.000,0.182]———Individualclaimedresponsibilitypublicly.—————Didtheindividualinjure?B2.458,Wald2 (1)7.852,p.01,95%CI[0.015,0.478]B3.719,Wald2 (1)6.734,p.01,95%CI[0.001,0.402]———Individualengagedinviolentbehaviorprevioustoterroristevent.B1.642,Wald2 (1)4.361,p.05,95%CI[0.041,0.904]————Individualhadstockpileofweapons.—————Individual’sparentsdivorced.—B2.198,Wald2 (1)3.405,p.1,95%CI[0.011,1.147]——B3.676,Wald2 (1)4.845,p.05,95%CI[0.001,0.668]Proximateupcominglifechange.B3.144,Wald2 (1)8.614,p.01,95%CI[0.005,0.352]B3.280,Wald2 (1)3.459,p.1,95%CI[0.001,1.193]——Inbuilduptoevent;individualexperiencedbeingtargetofprejudice.—————Chronicstressinindividual’slife.B1.434,Wald2 (1)3.063,p.1,95%CI[0.048,1.188]B2.088,Wald2 (1)3.143,p.1,955CI[0.012,1.247]———Note.Referencecategorynodiagnosis;—notsignificant.30 CORNER AND GILLThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.Second, the significant association between mental illness andhaving a spouse or partner associated with a wider movementsuggests those with mental illness may be susceptible to ideolog-ical influences in their immediate social environment. Additionalcase study-based research may identify similarities in ideologicalleanings and influence between couples.Third, the most common recurring theme in the literature con-cerning lone actors is social isolation. This work does not largelydeviate from previous conclusions. It demonstrates 52.9% of loneactors to be socially isolated. This article attempted to bridge thelink between the social isolation hypothesis (Thoits, 1983 citingFaris, 1934) and the socially isolative behaviors seen in loneactors. However, the resulting statistics demonstrate those with ahistory of mental illness are no more likely to have an associationwith social isolation than those without. This result provides im-portant implications for countering lone actor terrorism, and sug-gests community services hold the potential to be the most effec-tive discipline in combating this facet of behavior. Further workshould investigate community awareness programs concerningidentification of potential socially isolated lone actor offenders.Fourth, we found that lone actors with a history of mental illnessare more likely associated with single-issue ideologies than al-Qaeda inspired or extreme right-wing ideologies. This may alsohelp explain the (initially) counterintuitive finding that those withmental illness are significantly more likely to discriminate betweenpotential targets.Fifth, those who hold a single-issue ideology are more typicallyfixated upon a target that they see as wholly responsible for theirgrievance. For example, Walter Leroy Moody Jr. mailed pipebombs to specific targets affiliated with criminal courts and ScottRoeder targeted an abortion provider he extensively wrote aboutonline. These behaviors are reflected in certain mental illnesses.Those with mental illness can experience intrusive thought pro-cesses, neuroticism and psychotic episodes (American PsychiatricAssociation, 2000; Link & Stueve, 1994; World Health Organiza-tion, 2010) that cause fixations upon specific “targets” who theindividual view as responsible. This finding also follows Clarkeand Newman’s (2006) work on situational crime prevention. Theyhypothesize successful attacks to be more likely when opportuni-ties are apparent. Individuals fixating upon singular targets willencounter a great range of opportunities. The above evidence alsocounters the school of thought which explains irrationality tonegatively affect behavior of individuals (Hiday & Burns, 2010, p.479), impairing their capability of striking. To provide furtherstatistical evidence, future investigations also ought to considerempirically investigating the targets of attacks. The significantfinding that those with a mental illness have an association withclaiming responsibility publicly also fits diagnostic criteria ofcertain mental illnesses (grandiosity, extraversion, delusions, de-lirium, impulsivity, and attention seeking behaviors; AmericanPsychiatric Association, 2000; World Health Organization, 2010).The finding that those with a mental illness have an associationwith expressing a desire to hurt others may provide useful direc-tions for prevention efforts. To provide further statistical evidence,it is advised that future investigation should consider diagnosticcriteria and links with irrational behaviors demonstrated by men-tally ill lone actors.Sixth, despite previous research showing definitive associationsbetween individual’s with mental illness and crime (Anderson,Table5MultinomialRegressionVariableNumberofdiagnoses123Individual’sspouseorpartnerpartofwidermovement.B3.825,Wald2 (1)9.432,p.01,95%CI[0.002,0.251]B3.873,Wald2 (1)4.271,p.05,95%CI[0.001,0.819]B6.256,Wald2 (1)6.776,p.01,95%CI[0.000,0.213]Individualclaimedresponsibilitypublicly.———Didtheindividualinjure?B1.630,Wald2 (1)6.960,p.01,95%CI[0.058,0.658]B2.523,Wald2 (1)4.833,p.05,95%CI[0.008,0.761]B3.899,Wald2 (1)5.193,p.05,95%CI[0.001,0.580]Individualengagedinviolentbehaviorprevioustoterroristevent.B1.016,Wald2 (1)2.922,p.1,95%CI[0.133,1.161]——Individualhadstockpileofweapons.B1.295,Wald2 (1)4.273,p.05,95%CI[0.080,0.935]B2.818,Wald2 (1)4.737,p.05,95%CI[0.005,0.756]B2.414,Wald2 (1)2.894,p.1,95%CI[0.006,1.444]Individual’sparentsdivorced—B3.169,Wald2 (1)8.489,p.01,95%CI[0.005,0.354]B3.159,Wald2 (1)5.474,p.05,95%CI[0.003,0.599]Proximateupcominglifechange.——B6.020,Wald2 (1)7.433,p.01,95%CI[0.000,0.184]Inbuilduptoevent;individualexperiencedbeingtargetofprejudice.B1.599,Wald2 (1)4.813,p.05,95%CI[0.048,0.843]——Chronicstressinindividual’slife.—B2.685,Wald2 (1)5.029,p.05,95%CI[0.007,0.713]—Note.Referencecategorynodiagnosis;—notsignificant.31A FALSE DICHOTOMY?This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers. This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.1997; Holcom & Ahr, 1988; Singleton et al., 1998; Teplin, 1984),there were no significant associations found between mental ill-ness and prior criminal behavior. Those with a history of mentalillness are no more likely to have a criminal history that those withno history. However, because of the type of data analyzed, it wasnot possible to discern dates for previous criminal convictions andany psychiatric diagnoses. This could have helped determinewhether the terrorist act immediately followed the onset of adisorder. Further investigations should complete such analyses, todefinitively conclude whether those with a mental illness arestatistically more likely to possess criminal convictions. Althoughthose with a history of mental illness are not more likely to havea prior criminal conviction, the cohort did have a strong statisticallink with prior violent behaviors. These results support the pre-ceding literature that those with a mental illness are more likely tobe violent. It is suggested that future investigations should consideran actor’s history of violence and examine what constitutes violentbehavior and its link to criminal convictions.Seventh, the statistical analyses demonstrated significant asso-ciations between mental illness and stressors. The stressor thatremained most highly significant across both bivariate and multi-variate tests was if the individual’s parents were divorced. It is alsopossible to view divorce as a control variable and a proxy forsocial integration or lower levels of individual attachment andinvolvement. On a similar note, studies of far-right fatal violencein the U.S. show that these offenders are more likely to live incounties with higher divorce rates at the time of their offense. Toexpand on this investigation, further research should test the time-scale of stressor variables and the impact upon mental illnessonset. Only a small proportion of all stressor variables analyzedshowed a significant association with mental illness, aiding pro-fessionals when examining patients, as it provides direction forpossible intervention.Eighth, 45% of the significant variables identified in the bivari-ate analyses were also significant in the logistic regression analy-ses. These variables provide direction for mental health profes-sionals, as they should consider liaising with security professionalsconcerning patients displaying such variables.Ninth, the first multinomial regression analysis demonstratedcertain variables significantly impact upon certain mental illnessdiagnoses (despite the low number of individuals in each cate-gory). Schizophrenia and associated disorders is the only diagnos-tic group to be significantly associated with previous violence andthis supports past research (Krakowski et al., 1986; Shaw et al.,2006). Mood disorders demonstrate their susceptibility to stres-sors. Those who had divorced parents were significantly morelikely to have psychological development disorders (in this cohort,autism). This reflect the stress of raising a child with such adisorder (Higgins, Bailey, & Pearce, 2005). Negative statistics(though not significant) were found concerning stress related dis-orders and violent behavior (supporting Swanson et al., 1990).Negative associations were also found between personality disor-ders and autism and having a spouse or partner related to a terrormovement, which may be indicative of not having a spouse be-cause of the detrimental nature of these disorders. These resultssupport previous research. Future work may investigate a largercohort of diagnoses listed by the ICD-10 to confirm and expandupon these findings.Tenth, the significant variables in the multinomial regressionconcerning comorbidity of disorders do not present a strong casefor rejecting the null hypothesis. Most significant variables werefound to be so across all categories. Individual’s with one diag-nosis were, however, more likely to be violent before the event,contradicting previous evidence (Swanson et al., 1990). The pre-vious multinomial regression also demonstrated Schizophrenicindividuals to display the same behavior. In the current cohort it ispossible those diagnosed with Schizophrenia had no comorbiddiagnoses, resulting in the above finding. Individuals with dual-diagnoses were significantly connected to chronic stress. Thisfinding reflects the previous multinomial regression. Those withmood disorders were also significantly more likely to experiencethis variable, and of those with a mood disorder in this cohort 66%had comorbid diagnoses, which may have skewed resulting sig-nificant values. The significant finding that those with three ormore disorders were more likely to have a proximate upcominglife change should be investigated further, because of its potentialfunction for prevention policies. The cohort size of this regressionhas limited the significant findings. It is also a preliminary test.Further investigation should expand upon comorbidity and partic-ularly different combinations of comorbid disorders to identify anybehaviors useful for mental health professionals. Because mentaldisorders often share symptoms, further research may also focusupon analyzing symptoms of mental illness rather than the diag-noses themselves (Douglas, Guy, & Hart, 2009). Unfortunately,this was not possible in this article because of constraints in theavailable data. However, both authors are currently working along-side colleagues with the United Kingdom’s North West CounterTerrorism Unit under Project Regulus to consider both differentialdiagnosis and symptoms as risk factors of violence in a sample oflone domestic extremists.Finally, the findings of this investigation provide evidence thoselone actors with a history of mental illness are also more likely toengage in certain antecedent events and behaviors that security andpolicing agencies can utilize to monitor and prevent further devel-opments in attack plotting. In essence, the correlated behaviorsprovide an image of how risk can crystalize within the individualoffender and that our understanding of lone-actor terrorism shouldbe multivariate in nature. The findings presented in this articlesupport James et al. (2007) and Chermak, Freilich, and Simone(2010), who emphasize the need for cooperation between agenciesand widespread sharing of information. The empirical evidencesuggests mental health professionals may have a role in preventinglone-actor terrorist attacks. If mental health professionals wereaware of these findings then screening processes can be carried outby security agencies on patients that present similar antecedentsand behaviors in medical evaluations. Examples of multidisci-plinary cohesion concerning criminal offenses include the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) and the Fix-ated Threat Assessment Centre (FTAC). MAPPA involvesmultiple agencies (including mental health professionals, proba-tion service, police forces, and the HM prison service) who aretasked with managing offenders, and focuses upon a range ofoffenders (Ministry of Justice, 2012). FTAC is an initiative aimingto protect politicians, the British Royal Family, and other publicfigures from fixated individuals, by incorporating input from thedepartment of health and the metropolitan police (Fixated Re-search Group, 2013). MAPPA focuses upon offenders after con-32 CORNER AND GILLThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

We argue that data-driven analyses such as this articlecan help provide an empirical knowledge base from which orga-nizations like FTAC and MAPPA can make more informed deci-sions concerning risk and capability.ReferencesAbram, K.
