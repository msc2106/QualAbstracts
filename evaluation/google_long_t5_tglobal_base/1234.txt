ABSTRACT: 
Sounds received in the Gulf of Alaska at 3115 km from the ATOC/NPAL source at Kauai (75 Hz, 0.027-s resolution, bottom-mounted) are compared with acoustic and oceanographic models. Unlike data collected at stationary SOSUS arrays, these data come from a towed horizontal array at 372-m depth of military origin. A plausible identification of the acoustic reception is made despite the fact that only one transmission is collected and sound interacts with the bottom near the source. The similarity between the modeled and measured impulse response here may be useful for understanding the signals between this same source and the NPAL array near southern California. The plausible identification of sound from the horizontal array here appears to point toward the feasibility of using other military platforms of opportunity besides SOSUS to study acoustic propagation and possibly map climatic changes in temperature by means of tomography.

INTRODUCTIONSynthetic aperture receivers may yield sufficient resolu-tion to tomographically image climatic temperature varia-tions in the ocean related to El Nin˜o and the Southern Oscil-lation using signals from a few sources.1 While sparsesampling may reveal interesting features of climatic change,there may not be enough sound surveillance systems ~SO-SUS! or other stationary receivers to map these features us-ing tomography without interpolating between sections usinga dynamical model of the ocean’s circulation.2 This paperindicates that a towed horizontal array can be used to processand identify acoustic paths over ocean basin scales from asingle transmission from the ATOC3 source at Kauai. Sincethe received data come from a military origin, it appears thatsimilar arrays could augment stationary receivers to providea synthetic aperture for mapping climatic variations as theships move from day to day.Historically, it was suggested that the mesoscale couldbe mapped with stationary sources and receivers.4 A movingsource was used to map the mesoscale in a 300 by 300-km2area.5 A moving ship was used to map the mesoscale withina 1000-km-diam circle in the Atlantic.6 These investigationsused instruments with accurate time keeping and navigation.Mapping the mesoscale seems possible in a mesoscalesized box using inaccurately navigated receivers.7 Modelsindicate that synthetic aperture receivers can have locationerrors of O~1! km and still accurately map climatic variationsof temperature such as those due to El Nin˜o and the SouthernOscillation.1,8 In particular, the simulations suggest that to-mographic images of Rossby waves of order O~500! km andother large variations are well resolved using moving receiv-ers with very poor navigation. The effects from a semi-realistic mesoscale are almost negligible in these simulationsbecause of the dominant effects from large scales of tempera-ture on acoustic travel time. These results suggest the possi-bility of using mobile receivers for studying climate changeby means of tomography. A needed demonstration involvesprocessing sounds and identifying acoustic paths that propa-gate over basin-scales to mobile receivers.To do tomography between a fixed source on the bottomand mobile receivers, it appears to be useful to investigatetwo things. First, it is useful to see if acoustic paths can beidentified with imperfect information concerning the bottomdepth and subbottom properties near the source. It is possiblethat the difficulty in understanding the acoustic signal be-tween the Kauai source and an array near southern Californiais due to misunderstood interactions between sound and thebottom near the source and the receiver.3 On the other hand,sounds as received on the towed array discussed in this paperdo not interact with the bottom near the receiver, so thisgeometry is simpler to analyze. A plausible identification ismade by assuming that ray paths reflect specularly from thebottom near the source.Second, it appears necessary to find out if path identifi-cation can be made from a single transmission from thesource, instead of the traditional method of using numeroustransmissions interspersed over a day or longer. With manytransmissions, it is possible to average many records to es-tablish stable arrivals that may otherwise fade for a minute orso due to scattering. The fading of acoustic paths is analo-gous to the twinkling of stars at night due to atmosphericturbulence. The results of this paper support the view that asingle transmission can be enough to understand acousticpulses at the receiver. This appears to be the first time that amodel is used to identify signals from a single transmissionat basin-scales.a!Electronic mail: johnsr@sas.upenn.edu1497J. Acoust. Soc.

Power and accuratetiming are provided through a cable running to the shore. Abroadband signal is transmitted at a center frequency of 75Hz. The phase of the carrier is modulated every two cyclesusing a linear maximal shift register sequence having 1023digits. The first zeros in the emitted spectrum are at 75/2537.5 Hz on either side of 75 Hz. The signal periodicity andlevel are (1023)2/75527.280 s and 195 dB re 1 mPa @ 1 m,respectively. Of the 20 min or 44 transmitted periods begin-ning at 18:00 on 7 November 1997, 14 min, or 32 periods,are analyzed here.The receiver is a horizontal array of U.S. military origintowed at 372-m depth. The forward modeling in this papersets its location at 50.0967°N, 205.8467°E, which is writtenwith much greater precision than its accuracy of a few kilo-meters. The precision is given so others might model thissection using the same coordinates used here.The geodesic length between the source and receiver is3115.45 km ~Fig. 1!. During the arrival of the signal, thearray speed is 2.5 m/s and its heading is 137°T. Since thebearing angle to the source is about 190°T, the incomingsignal makes an angle of about 53° with respect to the head-ing of the ship. During the 14 min of data reception, the shiptravels 2.2 km and is 1.3 km closer to the source at the end ofthe 14 min. The data are time stamped with an accuracy of 5to 10 s. In this paper, it is not possible to compare predictionsof acoustic travel time with the data because of the uncer-tainties of position and timing. However, the sample rate ofthe data is stable and accurate.III. DATAUsing standard techniques the data are first beamformedtoward the source. Next, each 27.280-s M-sequence period isadjusted for various possible Doppler corrections and corre-lated with a replica of the transmitted sequence. Replica cor-relation with a linear maximal shift register sequence com-presses 27.280 s of energy from each acoustic path into apulse of duration 2/7550.026 67 s with a theoretical gain of10 log10 (1023)530 dB. The Doppler correction yielding thelargest signal-to-noise ratio is chosen for each period. Thisprocedure yields sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to examinethe impulse response.A few words can be said about the coherent integrationtime of this signal, though it has no bearing on other resultsin this paper. If one chooses the average Doppler correctionamong the 32 processed periods, the signal can be coherentlyintegrated for 80 s. It is not known if one could integrate fora longer period than this if one utilized a different Dopplercorrection for each period. This type of processing wouldexplore the degree to which the ship’s change in velocityaffects coherent integration time versus effects due to fluc-tuations in the ocean.A ‘‘bit plot’’ is shown for the output of each of 32 pro-cessed periods of the received signal ~top, Fig. 2!. Somefeatures persist for 14 min and other do not.Incoherent averages are formed usinga~m !5F 132 (r5132 id~m ,r !i2s2~r !

It isincluded to give proper weight to records based on theirsignal-to-noise ratio. s2(r) is estimated from each recordwhere signal is not present. The energy arrives around 2097s and ends around 2105 s, a duration of 8 s.FIG. 1.

Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 115, No. 4, April 2004 John L. Spiesberger: Single transmission identification at 3115 kmIV. MODELS FOR ACOUSTIC PROPAGATIONDifferent realizations of the internal wave field are mod-eled to ascertain their effects on acoustic variability. Withprevious data, this step has not been needed because manydata sets could be averaged to determine the features of thedata that were stable and could be expected to be identifiedfrom a model. With a single transmission, it is important tomodel the effects from a time-evolving internal wave field toestimate the portions of the model that ought to be stable andidentifiable.A. EnvironmentThe speed of sound is computed using Del Grosso’salgorithm10 and Levitus’ climatological averages11 of tem-perature and salinity for Fall. The depth of minimum speedvaries from 740 m at the source to 105 m at the receiver.Since the acoustic models use Cartesian coordinates, thesound speed profiles are translated to Cartesian coordinatesusing the Earth-flattening transformation.Internal waves are modeled with the Garrett–Munk12spectrum. Currents are ignored, being two orders of magni-tude less than sound speed perturbations arising from adia-batic vertical displacements of water in the upper ocean. Theperturbations are added to the climatology of sound speeddescribed above. Internal wave modes are precomputed andretrieved as needed at range intervals of 80 km to account forchanges in water depth, buoyancy frequency, and soundspeed. Vertical displacements of these modes are set to zeroat the surface and bottom. For each 80-km interval, a three-dimensional field of internal waves is computed in a box of80 km by 80 km by D m where D is the average depth of theocean in that interval. A vertical slice through the box givesthe vertical displacements along the geodesic. The energy ofthe internal wave field is taken to be that specified by Garrettand Munk12 because that energy level has matched observa-tions with this construction of internal waves before.13 Theliterature is not unanimous in its adoption of the best energylevel to use for acoustic modeling.14–16 Further informationon the construction of internal waves is found elsewhere.13The depth of the bottom near 100 km of the source istaken from a SEABEAM17 survey ~Bruce Howe, personalcommunication!. Beyond this range, depths are taken from adigital database18 ~Fig. 3!.For lack of a definitively better set of parameters for thesubbottom near the source, parameters like those used for theKaneohe source at Oahu13 are used. The thickness of thesediment is 200 m. The sound speed at the top of the sedi-ment divided by that at the bottom of the water column is1.02. The density of the sediment is 1.7 gm cm23. The at-tenuation in the sediment isa~ f !5a0 f p~dB m21!, ~2!where f is the frequency in kHz, p51, and a050.02 dB m21 kHz21. The speed in the sediment is taken toincrease with depth as 1 s21. The speed in the basementdivided by that at the bottom of the sediment layer is 2. Thedensity of the basement layer is 2.5 gm cm23. The attenua-tion in the basement is given by Eq. ~2! except a050.5 dB m21 kHz21 and p50.1. Geoacoustic parametersare needed within 500 km of the source because that is wherethe modeled sound field interacts with the bottom. Most ofthe interaction occurs in the first 50 km. Afterward, interac-tions occur with a few deep seamounts.FIG. 2. The impulse response from theKauai source for the section in Fig. 1on 7 November 1997. The bit plotshows signal-to-noise ratio from 23dB and less as white to 20 dB andmore as black. Each of the 32 separateperiods of received signal, covering atotal of 14 min, is separately processedto correct for the motion of the towedarray ~Doppler! and to remove theshift register sequence code using rep-lica correlation. The bottom panel isthe incoherent average @Eq. ~1!# ofthese 32 processed periods. The axisfor travel time is inaccurate.1499J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 115, No. 4, April 2004 John L. Spiesberger: Single transmission identification at 3115 kmB. Parabolic approximationThe sound speed insensitive parabolic approximation19is used to compute a two-dimensional field of sound alongthe geodesic from 0- to 8000-m depth. Tests19 suggest thattravel times of pulses are computed with an accuracy of afew milliseconds. The field is modeled at each of 2048acoustic frequencies. The impulse response is synthesizedwith an inverse Fourier transform resulting in a time serieswith a period of 27.3 s. In the first 48 km where soundinteracts with the steep slope of Kauai, the computationalgrid has an interval of 0.0333 km in range and 3.9 m indepth. At greater ranges, the grid interval is 0.1333 km inrange and 7.8 m in depth. These values are sufficient to ob-tain convergence within a few decibels at the receiver.C. RaysFans of rays are traced using a program, zray, that is amodification of ray.20 Eigenrays are found using another pro-gram. These programs have been used to identify acousticpaths before.21 Rays reflect specularly from the bottom. Bothgeometric and nongeometric arrivals are found. Geometrictypes are those that pass through the source and receiver.Nongeometric types are those that provide energy at the re-ceiver on the shadow sides of caustics. For lack of a morereliable value, rays that reflect from the bottom suffer anattenuation of 3 dB per bounce. The sound speed field usedfor the ray trace is identical to that used for the sound speedinsensitive parabolic model at its computational grid.V. IDENTIFYING ACOUSTIC PATHSA. Stable arrivals from modelsStable arrivals are those that can be tracked from day today. This cannot be investigated from one data record. In-stead, models are used to predict stability.Eight impulse responses are computed from the soundspeed insensitive parabolic approximation.19 The soundspeed field for each comes from Levitus’ climatology and afield of internal waves. Internal waves are generated at inter-vals of a day using the linear dispersion relation. Two inco-herent averages are computed from these eight impulse re-sponses ~Fig. 4!. Seven stable arrivals are labeled ~A–G!.Arrivals after 2105 s do not appear to be stable. Arrival Cdoes not look very stable but this is probably because thereare not enough model realizations to show its stability. Stablearrivals before A are unlabeled because they have very lowsignal-to-noise ratios in the data. Arrivals A–D appear toconsist of two resolved arrivals, which can be observed inmodeled time fronts ~Fig. 5!. Evidently, at the receiver depthof 372 m, these can be resolved in the presence of the mod-eled field of internal waves. Temporal separations of laterdoublets cannot be resolved. Without internal waves, morestable arrivals are predicted than when internal waves areadded ~Fig. 5!. Figure 4 appears to predict stability betterthan the time fronts, especially between 2104 and 2105 swhere it is difficult to judge stability from time fronts.B. Ray approximation for tomographic inversionThe impulse response from rays looks similar to thatfrom the parabolic approximation ~Fig. 6!. To use rays fortomographic inversions, it is necessary to show that, for eachstable arrival, the corresponding ray paths are themselvessampling a similar region of the ocean and that those raypaths have travel times that are sufficiently accurate.The first issue can be dealt with by finding the eigenraysfor different representations of ocean fields, and examiningthe paths for each realization for each stable arrival. Ourcomputer resources are insufficient to compute eigenraysthrough the internal wave field. Investigators have found thatat long distances, stable arrivals are composed of many rays.FIG. 3. The depth of the bottom is in-dicated along the section ~Fig. 1! withdetails near the source and receiver.Rays in the top 16 dB making up ar-rival B1 in Fig. 7 are indicated.1500 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 115, No. 4, April 2004 John L. Spiesberger: Single transmission identification at 3115 kmSome of the arrivals are suitable for tomographic inversionbecause their constituent ray paths have similar upper turn-ing depths even though their turning ranges are quitedifferent.16,21,22 In this experiment, some stable arrivals arecomposed of several rays ~A1, A2, B, C2, D1, E2, F1, F2,G1, G2! even though the mesoscale and internal wave scalesare not incorporated into the sound speed field ~Fig. 3!. Thenotation ‘‘A1’’ or ‘‘A2’’ denotes the first or second arrival ofa doublet, respectively. Upper turning depths for arrivalsA–G are 237 to 358 m, respectively, near the source and 61to 1 m, respectively, near the receiver. Most stable arrivalsappear to be suitable for tomographic inversions.The second issue is whether the travel times from raysare close enough to a full wave solution of the wave equationto warrant their use without significant modification. In thispaper, the full wave solution is given by the parabolic ap-proximation. Travel times of rays and stable arrivals from theparabolic model can differ because of diffraction23 and dueto the fact that the parabolic model includes propagation intothe subbottom. Rays are only allowed to reflect specularlyfrom the bottom. Despite these differences, the differences inmodeled travel times are less than 0.03 s, and are typicallyFIG. 4.

Spiesberger: Single transmission identification at 3115 km0.005 s ~Table I!. These errors are small compared to theclimatic signal of about 1 s expected from Rossby waveslinked to El Nin˜o and the Southern Oscillation.2C. Identifying arrivals in the dataThe most accurate model for identifying paths is theincoherent average of the output from the parabolic equationfor eight internal wave fields ~Fig. 7!. Using a visual align-ment, the association with the data is plausible. The sevenstable arrivals, A–G, from the model appear in the data. Thecutoff times from the data and model are similar, but the datahave an extra second of energy at lower levels at the end.This second of energy may come from a positive bias in thetravel time of sound that is trapped near the depth of mini-mum speed in the waveguide. Mesoscale eddies appear tohave caused biases of this order in a different transmission atbasin-scales.13The lack of an accurate time base probably does notsignificantly affect the confidence with which the data can beidentified with these models because other oceanographicvariability associated with ENSO can modify travel times byO~1! s ~Ref. 2!. With a 1-s error from any model, there is apossibility that the alignment in Fig. 7 is incorrect. However,it appears to be problematic to shift model times earlier orlater here because both the data and model exhibit a dramaticdrop in level at about 2108.5 s with the alignment in Fig. 7.It is plausible that the ‘‘extra energy’’ that arrives late in Fig.7 is due to a bias caused by the mesoscale. Thus, the align-ment in Fig. 7 is the best one, with other alignments appear-ing significantly worse. It seems that all acoustic modelshave difficulty identifying acoustic arrivals from any basin-scale section in the North Pacific without any doubt whatso-ever in the face of the inherent O~1! s uncertainty in traveltime due to unknown variability at climatic scales.VI. CONCLUSIONSAcoustic signals at 3115 km from a source near Kauaican be coherently processed to yield large signal-to-noiseratios on a towed array in the Gulf of Alaska ~Fig. 1!. Theacoustic paths that are predicted to be stable by means ofacoustic and oceanographic models can be identified in thedata. There are discrepancies between the models and data,particularly during the last second when weak arrivals areobserved that are not present in the model. The models useclimatological and internal wave variations, but do not in-clude a mesoscale. A previous study13 indicates that the me-soscale is responsible for a 0.6-s addition of energy at theend of the reception due to a positive bias in the travel timesFIG. 6.

Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 115, No. 4, April 2004 John L. Spiesberger: Single transmission identification at 3115 kmof sounds trapped near the axis of the acoustic waveguide.Unlike internal waves which have a universal spectrum,12 themesoscale is not so simply predicted. It is possible that someocean circulation models have a realistic mesoscale that canbe used to predict this bias.Mobile receivers allow studies of acoustic propagationto be conducted at relatively little cost for many differentgeographic regions. Although SOSUS stations and the singlesection studied here yield data that appear to be interpretablewith acoustic and oceanographic models, the outcome maybe more complicated in different areas of the ocean. Beingable to process and identify acoustic paths from the towedarray here seems to keep open the possibility of using mobilesystems for studying climatic temperature changes in theocean using tomography and synthetic apertures. Ray modelsfor some identified features from the data here indicate thattomographic inversions are feasible ~Fig. 3!.At first thought, inaccurate timing at a receiver mayseem to preclude tomography in the ocean. The literaturecontains a paper showing that models of climatic variabilitycan be accurately mapped from a few sources and 20 mobilereceivers even when the time base in the sources is off byhours.24 The same principles used in that paper could beapplied to ask if climatic variability could be mapped if thetime bases on mobile receivers were off by hours, but theirtime bases were stable over months at a time. It is too earlyto conclude that inaccurate time bases at mobile receiverseither could or could not produce accurate maps of climaticvariability. On the other hand, accurate timing could be pro-vided for towed arrays if desired.A significant effort is still required to interpret signalstransmitted over basin-scales despite the contemplation ofthis effort 83 years ago.25 The process cannot be done inreal-time at this point in history. Once a seemingly correctchoice of acoustic and oceanographic models is used to iden-tify acoustic paths at a receiver, the computer times requiredto do the modeling are counted in weeks rather than in the 30min or so required for the signal to propagate from thesource to the receiver. Finding a suitable set of acoustic andoceanographic models usually takes much longer than a fewweeks. Perhaps during the next decades, enough experiencewith other data sets and models will make it possible toaccurately predict acoustic signals in many regions of theocean. The speeds of computation necessary to make predic-tions will probably not be a limiting factor when predictionscan be made reliably and routinely.The modeled signal penetrates the bottom near theKauai source. Even though the geoacoustic parameters forthis region are currently not well known from the literature, aplausible identification is made at basin-scales, even whenthe bottom properties are ignored and only specular reflec-tion from the bottom is allowed ~ray model, bottom, Fig. 6,Table I!. This identical finding13,21 is obtained from the Ka-neohe source near Oahu ~133 Hz, 16 Hz bandwidth, 3709 kmsection!. Is it luck that the subbottom need not be well mod-eled for these sections, or are other acoustic sections moresensitive to models for propagation in the solid Earth? In anycase, the data from the Gulf of Alaska can be used to test theway bottom interactions are modeled near the Kauai source.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis research was supported by the Office of Naval Re-search ~ONR!
