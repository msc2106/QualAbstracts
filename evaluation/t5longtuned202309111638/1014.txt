ABSTRACT: 
This article focuses on the role of Lord Home, the British Foreign Secretary, in the conduct of Angloâ€“American relations between 1961 and 1963. It studies three controversial policy areas: the newly independent states of Laos and the Congo, along with the debate over the decolonisation of British Guiana; the key Cold War issues of Berlin and Cuba; and a variety of nuclear weaponsâ€“related matters. It is argued that Home, in constantly striving to maintain the alliance, was more pro-American than Macmillan. He exercised an important restraining and calming influence on the Prime Minister, preventing him from pursuing potentially damaging initiatives. However, the relationship between the two men was strong. Homeâ€™s diplomacy usually complimented Macmillanâ€™s interventions and they often worked together.

To them, Home was not inclined to seek the limelight and was happy to concentrate on other areas.15 In contrast, another school holds that Macmillan believed in delegation and non-interference.16 As John Dickie SXWLWÂµ7KH3ULPH0LQLVWHUZDVQHYHUDPHGGOHULQWKHUXQQLQJRIWKH)RUHLJQ2IILFHGXULQJ /RUG +RPHÂ¶V WHUP RI RIILFHÂ¶17 Lord Kilmuir concurred, asserting that with +RPHÂ¶V DSSRLQWPHQW Âµ7he Foreign Office, which had virtually been under the personal direction of the Prime Minister since 1955, once again began to function as it VKRXOGGRÂ¶18 ,WLVGLIILFXOWWRGLVHQWDQJOH+RPHÂ¶VUROHIURP0DFPLOODQÂ¶VRWKHUWKDQWKURXJKa close examination of archival sources. Using such an approach, this article sheds light on this important area by addressing two key questions. FirstLWDQDO\VHV+RPHÂ¶Vrole in Anglo-American relations, both in conversing with US representatives and shaping policy. Secondly, it examines his association with Macmillan. The three broad areas in which WKHÂµVSHFLDOUHODWLRQVKLSÂ¶ was most tested are analysed, covering DUDQJHRIÂµKLJKÂ¶DQGÂµORZÂ¶LVVXHV7KHILUVWGLIIHUHQFHVDSSHDUHGLQDWWLWXGHVWRFLYLOwars in newly independent states, most notably Laos and the formerly Belgian Congo.

Contrastingly, the signing of the limited Test-Ban Treaty represented a triumph of Anglo-American co-LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 3 operation. The analysis proceeds in the context of previous relationships between Prime Ministers and Foreign Secretaries. There has often been tension between forceful Prime Ministers and their Foreign Secretaries. Lord Curzon under David Lloyd George (1918-1922), Arthur Henderson under Ramsay MacDonald (1929-1931), and Anthony Eden under Winston Churchill (1951-1955) are prime example. Furthermore, Selwyn Lloyd under Eden (1955-1957) and Macmillan (1957-1960) found himself permanently overshadowed by prime ministerial intervention in foreign policy matters. Three key themes emerge from this literature: personality clashes, prime ministerial interference in foreign policy and a sometimes uneasy division of responsibilities. Personal friction is most DSSDUHQWLQWKHILUVWWZRRIWKHDERYHFDVHV&XU]RQÂµEURXJKWRXWWKHVSLWHIXOVLGHRI/OR\G*HRUJHÂ¶VQDWXUHÂ¶19 and the Prime Minister often attacked and denigrated him in Cabinet. There was also unpleasantness between MacDonald and Henderson. 0DF'RQDOG ÂµVQLSHG DW WKH )RUHLJQ 6HFUHWDU\Â¶V ODFN RI FRPSHWHQFH KDPVWUXQJ KLVLQLWLDWLYHVDQGPDOLJQHGKLPLQWKHSUHVHQFHRISROLWLFLDQVDQGWUDGHXQLRQOHDGHUVÂ¶20 Prime ministerial interference in foreign affairs often exacerbated these personality clashes. MacDonald set a trend days after coming to power when, as the FO was attempting to improve Anglo-French relations, he authorised a Sunday Times article criticising France for her treatment of minorities.21 Eventually Henderson snapped. As the issue of a loan from France to Germany was considered in 1931, he ÂµEHJDQ WR SXUVXH D SHUVRQDO IRUHLJQ SROLF\ ZLWK D UHFNOHVV GLVUHJDUG RI WKH 3ULPH0LQLVWHUÂ¶VYLHZVÂ¶22 Lloyd George also tried to circumvent the Foreign Office. He had his own advisers on foreiJQ SROLF\ WKH 6HFUHWDULDW RU Âµ*DUGHQ 6XEXUEÂ¶ ZKLFKCurzon resented. In 1922, Lloyd George used Lord Derby to arrange a meeting with French Premiere Raymond PoincarÃ©. An outraged Curzon learned of this via the French press. The Prime Minister would even DFWLYHO\XQGHUPLQH&XU]RQÂ¶VSROLFLHVlike his efforts to secure peace between Greece and Turkey in March 1921. &KXUFKLOOÂ¶VLQWHUIHUHQFHLQIRUHLJQSROLF\EHJDQGXULQJ:RUOG:DU,,DQGFRQWLQXHGLQpeace-time, often on trivial matters.

This was most marked in the second Labour Government, where MacDonald took charge of Anglo-American relations, and became less critical of Henderson in return. The division took a different form under Lloyd George, who in relation to Germany, for example, took control of many key decisions and negotiations, but left Curzon to develop the detail. Curzon actually had no wish to intervene in the Adriatic controversy or relations with France. The same was true of the European aspect of Russian policy as Curzon preferred the Asian dimension, on which he was very NQRZOHGJHDEOH 1LFROVRQ WKHUHIRUH DUJXHV WKDW /OR\G *HRUJHÂ¶V FRQGXFW ÂµZDV QRWunwarrantable.

For example, the idea of meeting the Soviets engrossed Churchill in July 1954, leading him to propose a meeting with Molotov in VSLWH RI (GHQÂ¶V DGYLFH DQG UHVXOWLQJ LQ UHVLJQDWLRQ WKUHDWV DSOHQW\ LQ WKH )RUHLJQOffice. In contrast, the relationship between Home and Macmillan was generally smoother, LQVSLWHRIWKH3ULPH0LQLVWHUÂ¶s undoubted interference in foreign affairs. II Three recently, or soon to be, independent states caused tension in Anglo-American relations. In Laos, both Home and Macmillan used their influence to help steer the US away from large-scale armed involvement, though the evidence shows that the 3ULPH0LQLVWHUÂ¶Vrole was greater. Home nevertheless played a part with his diplomacy both in Washington and Geneva. His attitude to two key issues, funding military operations and military intervention, demonstrates his prioritisation of relations with the US. Nigel Ashton correctly states WKDWÂµIRUWKHPRVWSDUWGXULQJWKHKennedy Presidency the question of decolonisation did not figure highly on the list of Anglo-$PHULFDQ SUREOHPVÂ¶26 There were two exceptions to this. The first was the Belgian Congo, on which Home dominated policy. His beliefs were the main determinant of the British approach and concern for British interests and especially Rhodesia influenced these. The Foreign Secretary uncharacteristically and vehemently opposed the US on the Congo. He was hostile to the cost of the operations, the role of the United Nations, the implementation of sanctions and the use of force. He also opposed the US on British Guiana, arguing against the resumption of direct rule, but his role diminished as Macmillan became more involved.

The Foreign Secretary contributed via diplomacy. US policy-makers were very reluctant to attend the second Geneva conference on Laos. Home, the joint chairman, had some doubts too, but urged the Americans not to denigrate the idea, especially once the Soviets showed a willingness to respect it. At the outset of the conference Britain favoured a neutral Laos, but US decision-makers were unenthusiastic. Home played an important part in overcominJWKLVSHUIRUPLQJÂµZKDWmany observers regarded as a diplomatic tour de force in persuading the various SUHVVXUH JURXSV WR GURS WKHLU EORFNLQJ WDFWLFVÂ¶ VR WKDW WKH UHDO SUREOHPV FRXOG EHtackled.30 The Conference reached agreement on a neutral Laos 14 months later, though after a few days Home had left negotiations in the hands of Malcolm MacDonald.

He was not afraid to be blunt, leaving Kennedy wondering ÂµZKHWKHU WKH )RUHLJQ 6HFUHWDU\Â¶V FRUUHVSRQGHQFH KDG EHHQ D ELW Â³VKDUSÂ´ LQ WRQHÂ¶61 +RPHSUHVVHGKLV YLHZRI -DJDQ DV ÂµD FRQIXVHG WKLQNHUÂ¶ZKR ÂµKDVQRW VLQFHproved as difficult tRGHDOZLWKDVKHZDVHDUOLHUÂ¶DQGVWHDGIDVWO\RSSRVHGH[FHVVLYHLQWHUIHUHQFH LQ %ULWLVK *XLDQDÂ¶V DIIDLUV +LV UHVSRQVH WR 5XVNÂ¶V )HEUXDU\ approach to do so ZDVDVÂµFROGDVWKHDUFWLFÂ¶TXHVWLRQLQJKRZDQHOHFWHGOHDGHUFRXOGbe prevented from holding RIILFHLQDGHPRFUDF\$IHZPRQWKVODWHUKHZURWHWKDWÂµLIZHWULHGDQ\WKLQJÂ«ZHVKRXOGRQO\PDNHPDWWHUVZRUVHÂ¶62 +RPHÂ¶V motives for opposing this were mixed. He was mindful of the interests of the Guianan people. Resuming direct rule risked Cuba declining to buy rice from British Guiana.

Firstly, he, like Macmillan, was worried about the financial cost of resuming direct rule. He emphasised the importance of LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 9 $PHULFDQ ILQDQFLDO DVVLVWDQFH LI GLUHFW UXOH ZDV UHVXPHG WKLQNLQJ LW ÂµLPSUDFWLFDEOHDQGGDQJHURXVÂ¶ZLWKRXWWKLV64 Concern for the UN was the second theme.

For this reason, he took more of an interest in Laos and British Guiana than the Congo. On Laos, the Foreign Secretary was more conciliatory towards the US than the Prime Minister, winning extra funding for operations and taking a more positive attitude to contingency planning. Conversely, on the Congo, where his control was greatest, Home showed that he was not afraid to oppose the US, yet he did not want to go too far. When Macmillan did become involved, as over British Guiana, Home remained intimately involved in discussions, but his chief took greater decision-making power. The Foreign Secretary opposed the US for a number of reasons. He was keen to protect British economic interests, which also partly explains his attitude to Katanga and to sanctions. This contrasts with his readiness to make concessions over Cuba, which was less important to Britain as a market. Furthermore, Home was concerned throughout with the strain on British financial resources. He was eager to remove the expense of Guiana and found having to pay for the UN operation in the Congo infuriating. Rhodesia was most important to him however. Fear for Northern Rhodesia drove the Foreign 6HFUHWDU\Â¶V policy on the Congo and also influenced his opposition to resorting to direct rule in British Guiana. III Two issues threatened to bring the Superpowers to war in this period. On Berlin, Home stood firm against Soviet threats. However, like Macmillan, he favoured negotiations and eschewed economic sanctions and military contingency planning, causing disagreement with the Americans. The two men thus worked together to deflect criticism of Britain whilst minimising British commitments, though the Foreign Secretary was the keener of the two to appease the US. The allies also differed on Cuba. The Cabinet opposed trade sanctions, but Home favoured LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 10 concessions to the Americans. This led to conflict with the Board of Trade over credit reporting, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) list (which restricted trade with Eastern bloc states) and the sale of Leyland buses to Cuba. When the Cuban missile crisis erupted in October 1962 the British role was limited but helpful. Home contributed personally by both steadying and restraining the Prime Minister. The US, Britain, France and the Soviet Union jointly occupied Berlin. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev threatened to sign a peace treaty with the GDR, leaving access to West Berlin under East German control. Home supported the Americans and remained firm in the face of Russian threats. Working with Rusk, he repeatedly assured Gromyko of Western resolve. 7KH )RUHLJQ 6HFUHWDU\Â¶V intervention could \LHOG GLUHFW DQG EHQHILFLDO UHVXOWV $IWHU JLYLQJ *URP\NR ÂµXQVKLUWHG KHOOÂ¶66 for the dropping of chaff in Western air corridors to interfere with radar, the Soviet action stopped within hours. Despite this public firmness however, Home and Macmillan both emphasised negotiation. The Foreign Secretary thought this necessaryÂµLIRQO\LQRUGHUWRVWUHQJWKHQRXUKDQGZLWKSXEOLFRSLQLRQÂ¶67 He thought the same was true of NATO. Furthermore, Home believed it possible to move the Soviets by argument.68 Thus, in April 1961 he pressed the Americans to negotiate and repeated this in June, though he did not suggest that negotiations should begin immediately.69 The Foreign Secretary own initiatives both failed however. Soviet opposition foiled his renewed efforts in October 1961 to establish a UN presence in Berlin, whilst West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer successfully opposed his joint plan with Rusk to establish an international access authority. Shlaim, Jones and Sainsbury argue that Home was more wary than Macmillan of making concessions to the USSR,70 but the evidence suggests otherwise.

By December 1961, he was arguing that the West might have to compromise on the recognition of East Germany and of the Oder-Neisse line, occupation rights, and links between West Berlin and West Germany71 Â± a comprehensive list. The Prime Minister urged the same. By then however, Home had become concerned that the Americans were ÂµDOPRVWWRRNHHQÂ¶RQQHJRWLDWLRQV He worried that this could weaken the effect of the US military build up and push France and West Germany together in opposition to LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 11 talks, harming %ULWDLQÂ¶V EEC application. He therefore tried to restrain Rusk before the Paris NATO meeting.72 This emphasis on negotiations came at the expense of other initiatives, causing conflict with the US. Although Home also opposed maritime counter measures,73 the main area of division was over military contingency planning. Britain was already struggling with her global commitments and he gave warning of his reluctance to remove forces from other areas, such as the Far East and Kuwait. Even if Britain did LQFUHDVH KHU IRUFHV 6RYLHW VXSHULRULW\ VWLOO PHDQW WKDW +RPH ÂµKDG QRW VHHQ DQ\SRVVLELOLWLHVZKLFKPDGHPXFKVHQVHÂ¶74 He and Macmillan also thought US probing provocative and feared accidental war. After the Wall was erected, the Foreign Secretary thus minimised protest for fear of increasing tension.75 Home and Macmillan worked together over Berlin.

He dissuaded Macmillan from approaching Kennedy directly to request the removal of the irascible US General, Lucius Clay. During the Berlin Wall crisis, Home remained calm, speaking to Macmillan every evening and successfully pressuring him to climb down after the Prime Minister attacked the press.78 Whilst the US disapproved of British policy on Berlin, many Americans YLHZHGKHUSRVLWLRQRQ&XEDDVÂµDJURVVDFWRIEHWUD\DOÂ¶79 This manifested itself most clearly in %ULWDLQÂ¶V refusal to join trade sanctions. Overseas trade accounted for 40 per cent of British GNP, whilst the American figure was just six per cent. Home pressed his position onto the US, telling Rusk, with reference to Nasser and Mossadeq, that sanctions did not work.80 He gave Kennedy the same message three months later. In LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 12 NATO, Britain persuaded the Political Committee to oppose both common economic measures that could become public, and the inclusion of Cuba in the COCOM list. :KLOVW Âµ0DFPLOODQ SHUXVHG D UREXVWO\ LQGHSHQGHQW DSSURDFK WR WUDGH ZLWK&XEDLQWKHIDFHRILQFUHDVLQJ86SUHVVXUHÂ¶+RPHVRXJKWWRPDNHFRQFHVVLRQVLike over Berlin, he warned that ÂµZHGRQRWZLVK WR VHHP OHVV V\PSDWKHWLF WR WKHP WKDQRWKHU1$72FRXQWULHVÂ¶81 However, the President of the Board of Trade, Fred Erroll, opposed even the monitoring of exports to see if they contained any strategic material, fearing that this would leave Britain vulnerable to renewed calls for Cuba to be added WRWKH&2&20OLVW0DFPLOODQWKRXJKW(UUROOÂµULJKWLQKLVDUJXPHQWÂ¶DQG+RPHJUHZincreasingly concerned.

The issue of the expansion of the COCOM list reared its head again in 1963. The Foreign Office worried that the British refusal to comply would jeopardize Â£2 million of military aid, but Erroll again proved difficult. He feared setting a precedHQWÂµZKLFKZRXOGEHFRQWUDU\WRRXUZKROHSROLF\RIOLEHUDOWUDGLQJÂ¶2QWKLVRFFDVLRQKRZHYHUSUHVVXUHIURP+RPHDQGWKH)2paid off and Erroll agreed to deny licences to export COCOM goods to Cuba.83 The Foreign Secretary was less successful over the sale of Leyland buses to Cuba.

Despite Foreign Office protests, the Cabinet endorsed this decision.84 The Foreign Secretary later changed his view anyway. When Leyland won a further contract in January 1964 Home, by then Prime Minister, warned an irate President Johnson that to curtail trade would cause a surge of Anti-Americanism in the House of Commons.85 He was keen to protect British interests and ensure that the US should not dictate policy to her.86 On 14 October 1962, a major Cold War crisis erupted with the discovery of 6RYLHWPLVVLOHVLQ&XED+*1LFKRODVFODLPVWKDW%ULWDLQZDVÂµQRWPHUHO\FRQVXOWHGÂ«EXWLQWLPDWHO\LQYROYHGÂ¶LQPDQDJing crisis.87 However, historians and participants alike generally agree that British influence was limited. Home himself wrote that Âµ1HLWKHU %ULWDLQ QRU )UDQFH ZDV consulted, but we were informed as events XQIROGHGÂ¶88 Nevertheless, Britain still played a useful role. She was primarily LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 13 concerned to prevent the conflict spreading into Berlin and helped ensure that US forces in Europe were exempt from the potentially provocative Defence Condition (DEFCON) 3 alert status.

The Foreign Secretary was committed to negotiations over Berlin, but perceived the different nature of the Cuban missile crisis and rebuffed Soviet attempts to secure British intervention. On both issues, he was the most pro-American member of the Cabinet. He was prepared to consider reintroducing conscription, whilst his desire to appease American sensibilities over Cuban trade caused some fierce Cabinet battles.

The Prime Minister also took more of an interest in Berlin than in less high profile foreign policy issues like the Congo and the documents show more detailed co-operation between the two over the issue. Home often took the lead when both men attended meetings with US policy makers,93 but LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 14 the two generally worked in tandem in opposing military planning whilst endeavouring to avoid appearing weak in American eyes. IV With Cold War tensions at their height, nuclear weapons were the subject of many Anglo-American debates. The first group of these related to co-operation between Britain and third parties. The US opposed Britain sharing her knowledge with France, causing a split between Home and Macmillan that was mirrored over whether Britain should deal with Israel. Direct Anglo-American co-operation was also at stake, with the US cancellation of the Skybolt missile provoking a major diplomatic crisis.

He was more involved in opposing the US plan for a multilateral nuclear force. At times he seemed lukewarm to the idea and he defended it to the Russians, but he steadfastly opposed it in discussions with US policy-makers. The Prime Minister also took the lead over disarmament, the third area, occasionally bypassing Home.

The Minister of Defence, Harold Watkinson, hinted to his French opposite number at possible co-operation on a nuclear submarine and although Home was part of the delegation at Rambouillet, he was excluded from private meetings and misled about nuclear co-operation.94 The French approach to the British firm Foster Wheeler to supply a heat exchanger and other parts for a nuclear submarine revealed the differences between the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. Macmillan and Peter Thorneycroft, who replaced Watkinson in July 1962, were happy to agree to the request without LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 15 considering the US. A Foreign Office memorandum conceded the ambiguity of the legal position, but an alarmed Home insisted that the US be consulted.

In February 1963, he advised the Prime Minister to consider submitting part of the British nuclear arsenal to NATO and the following month argued that Britain could gain some advantage by contributing to the mixed-manned force. Throughout the spring the Foreign Secretary continued to try to persuade Macmillan to support the MLF, seeing the idea as a way of enhancing British prestige in the US, even though it was intended to have the reverse effect.110 However, Home was at best ambivalent about the MLF, repeatedly attacking it LQ SULYDWH FRQYHUVDWLRQV ZLWK WKH $PHULFDQV $W 1DVVDX KH QRWHG WKDW ÂµZH GLG QRWhave a single ally in Europe that would allow Germany to have its finger on the WULJJHUÂ¶2QYLVLWLQJ:DVKLQJWRQLQ2FWREHUKHUHDIILUPHGWR.HQQHG\WKDWÂµWKH0/) KDG KDUGO\ D IULHQG LQ WKH 8QLWHG .LQJGRPÂ¶111 and secured a US pledge to proceed slowly with the idea.

He met Rusk in April and May 1963, agreeing at the latter meeting to pursue a ban on atmospheric testing if a total ban proved impossible. They held LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 18 another meeting days before WKH 3UHVLGHQWÂ¶V Birch Grove visit in June,122 to which Macmillan and Kennedy added little.

The debates surrounding nuclear weapons reveal some further interesting facets of the relationship between Home and Macmillan on the one hand, and reaffirm WKH )RUHLJQ 6HFUHWDU\Â¶V attitude to the US on the other. The Prime Minister was greatly interested in these issues. As such, he took greater responsibility himself, sometimes sidelining Home. This was most pronounced when the debates impacted on the policies about which he was most passionate, namely the Test-Ban Treaty and the British EEC application. In these areas there is evidence that Macmillan purposely deceived Home, something he cannot be seen to do elsewhere. Yet this is balanced by other evidence that he valued KLV )RUHLJQ 6HFUHWDU\Â¶V input. Home still played an important role. Macmillan could not do everything and WKH)RUHLJQ6HFUHWDU\Â¶Vwork, often with Rusk, made things easier for him. The Test-Ban Treaty process illustrates this well. Moreover, Home again restrained Macmillan from acting in ways that could have been damaging to Anglo-American relations. Above all, the Foreign Secretary was determined to ensure that relations remained as positive as possible, no matter how unreasonable the US action. He was not afraid to go against his Cabinet colleagues, as shown by his position on supplying the heat exchanger to France. LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 19 V The years 1961-1963 have often been viewed as a high-point in Anglo-American relations. Of course, Harold Macmillan, in striking up a rapport with the young US President, deserves credit for this. Yet so too does Lord Home, something that the existing literature fails to fully consider. Home was in regular contact with US policy-makers, especially Rusk and Ambassador David Bruce, performing a dual-role. He invariably supported the US against the USSR and aimed to avoid public disagreement, but privately he spoke frankly, especially over Berlin, the MLF and the Congo. In British policy-making, his role was to push the Government towards policies likely to facilitate closer relations. He was usually more pro-American than Macmillan. On Cuban trade, he argued long and hard that Britain should be more co-operative with the US, whilst his position on nuclear sales to France and Israel was far more conciliatory than any of his colleagues. He was prepared to consider reintroducing conscription for the sake of Berlin despite the political drawbacks and even showed some enthusiasm for the MLF. The Congo, and to a lesser extent British Guiana, were the exceptions. Home opposed the US over the Congo, repeatedly threatening to veto UN Security Council resolutions. This can be explained by his passion on the issue, his concern for Rhodesia and other British interests in the area, and his distrust of the UN. It can also be no coincidence that, like in British Guiana, the Soviet threat was relatively low. +RPHÂ¶V pro-Americanism often brought him in to conflict with other departments, but he carried weight in the Cabinet and in Whitehall. He was able to convince the Treasury to provide extra funding for Laos and the Board of Trade to agree to extend the COCOM list regarding Cuba. Yet he did not always get his own way and was overruled by the Cabinet on the issue of Cuban trade and nuclear sales to France, among others. Prime ministerial support could be vital. On one occasion Home was only able to secure Cabinet approval for his view when Macmillan joined him in opposition to the Board of Trade. +RPHÂ¶VRWKHU JUHDW FRQWULEXWLRQ WR WKHDOOLance was his restraining influence on the Prime Minster.

During the Cuban missile crisis, the Prime Minister wanted to make an attempt to prevent war, but his doing so would LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 20 KDYH VHULRXVO\ ZHDNHQHG WKH $PHULFDQ SRVLWLRQ 0DFPLOODQÂ¶V HQWKXVLDVP for summitry during the negotiations for the Test-Ban Treaty also carried risks. He was a more nervous and volatile character than Home and, as the historiography suggests, they complimented each other effectively in this respect. The Foreign Secretary provided reassurance, and, although his views on the Congo showed that he himself was not immune to pique when passionate about an issue, Home would also calm the 3ULPH 0LQLVWHUÂ¶V WHPSHU When American conduct over missile sales enraged Macmillan, it was Home that prevented him from exacerbating the situation. The relationship between Home and Macmillan was a positive one. In contrast to other relationships between Prime Ministers and their Foreign Secretaries, there was a marked absence of personal animosity between them. The two men came from a similar background. Both went to Eton and Oxford, and the Prime Minister was married to the daughter of the Duke of Devonshire. In Government, they had built a solid relationship whilst Home was at the Commonwealth Relations Office. The Prime Minister referred in his diary to Home DVRQHRIÂµWKRVH,WUXVWÂ¶,126 and actively helped the Foreign Secretary to succeed him. Macmillan did involve himself in foreign policy, but there was no explicit division of responsibility. Contrary to HorneÂ¶VYLHZ, Home controlled policy on the Congo. The Prime Minister took little interest until late in the day. He cared more for areas of high-level Cold War tension, but the Foreign Secretary played a greater role here than the existing historiography suggests. Apart from a rare example over nuclear testing, the Prime Minister did not exclude Home from policy-making. In fact, the reverse was true, with the Foreign Secretary often working in concert with Macmillan. This was the case throughout the Cuban missile crisis and largely over Berlin. Despite some disagreement over Laos, they again combined to help prevent a major US military operation. Where Macmillan was involved, +RPHÂ¶VUROH, as the Skybolt crisis showed, was overtly diminished, yet he remained involved. On the Test-Ban Treaty for example, prime ministerial interventions were vital, but Home and Rusk laid much of the groundwork for the successful Moscow Conference. This all serves to illustrate some features of the special relationship as Home conducted it. There can be no doubt that the American position was pre-eminent, hence WKH )RUHLJQ 6HFUHWDU\Â¶V desire to remain close to the US. The influence of British economic decline repeatedly appears. Both Home and Macmillan were desperate to minimize British expenditure, hence their hostility to UN operations in LORD HOME AND ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, 1961-1963 21 the Congo and military contingency planning, and their eagerness to grant British Guiana independence. It also goes some way towards explaining the British preference for negotiation and the nuclear defence strategy. Politically, the case of the Congo demonstrates that Britain was unable to succeed when the US opposed her. However, Britain did benefit from her high levels of access to the US. This enabled policy-makers to counsel against measures with which they disagreed. Sometimes, as on Laos, they were successful. Other times they were not, but at least they were heard. Arguably %ULWDLQÂ¶V JUHDWHVW EHQHILW FDPH LQ WKH GHIHQFH DUHQD ZKHQ 0DFPLOODQsecured Polaris on very favourable terms. From the American perspective, Britain proved to be a loyal friend. This was most notable during the Cuban missile crisis, where personal contacts were especially important. Macmillan provided reassurance to Kennedy, whilst Ormsby-Gore suggested that the blockade be placed closer to the coast to give the Soviets more time to think. By working with Britain over British Guiana, and exploiting her leverage over her, the US was able to ensure that Jagan did not emerge as leader of the newly independent state. Here, like elsewhere, Britain acted to support the US in spite of disagreeing with her. The special relationship thus brought benefits for both parties between 1961 and 1963/RUG+RPHÂ¶VFRQWULEXWLRQto it was of central importance.
