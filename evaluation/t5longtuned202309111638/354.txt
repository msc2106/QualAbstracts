ABSTRACT: 
Shame is a ubiquitous and highly intriguing feature of human experience. It can motivate but it can also paralyse. It is something which one can legitimately demand of another, but is not usually experienced as a choice. Perpetrators of atrocities can remain defiantly immune to shame while their victims are racked by it. It would be hard to understand any society or culture without understanding the characteristic occasions upon which shame is expected and where it is mitigated. Yet, one can survey much of the literature in social and political theory over the last century and find barely a footnote to this omnipresent emotional experience. The two books under review aim to rectify this lacuna. 
 
PREDICTION: 
This article examines the relationship between shame and the great genocides of the last century. The two works under review aim to rectify this lacuna. These two works have much in common. Both are concerned with the relationship between shame and the great genocides of the last century. Robert Agamben, Robert Antelme, and Robert Antelme, he argues that the emergence of a distinctive philosophical voice in the process of moving beyond its intellectual origins is a critical critical response to the failure of our governments to intervene in Rwanda.

It is something which one can legitimately demand13 of another, but is not usually experienced as a choice. Perpetrators of atrocities can14 remain defiantly immune to shame while their victims are racked by it. It would be15 hard to understand any society or culture without understanding the characteristic16 occasions upon which shame is expected and where it is mitigated. Yet, one can17 survey much of the literature in social and political theory over the last century and18 find barely a footnote to this omnipresent emotional experience. The two books19 under review aim to rectify this lacuna.20 These two works have much in common. Both are concerned with the relationship21 between shame and the great genocides of the last century. Morgan’s focus is upon22 the perpetrators and bystanders while Hutchinson’s interest is in the experience of23 survivors, such as Primo Levi. Both are troubled by philosophers’ neglect of shame24 and look for insight in literature and film. Hutchinson is systematically and militantly25 atheoretical in his approach; Morgan takes a more elliptical route but it is clear from26 his frequent references to Wittgensteinian thinkers, such as Stanley Cavell, that he27 would sympathise with much that Hutchinson writes.28 Of the two, Hutchinson’s book is the more academically substantial. It is as much29 a contribution to ongoing debates in contemporary analytic philosophy of the30 emotions as it is a book about shame. Morgan’s work is more popular in style and31 would be well suited to an introductory course on philosophy of the emotions orA1 R. P.

Taken together, both represent a welcome contribution33 to the growing literature on philosophy and the emotions.34 That there is such a growing literature may come as a surprise to some readers,35 and this is itself indicative. For much of the twentieth century the emotions36 languished in the philosophical backwaters. If they were discussed at all, it was37 generally within ‘soft’ areas such as aesthetics. The dominance of cognitivism in38 moral and political theory meant that they were given a cursory treatment as non-39 rational motives or preferences which could supply the fuel but never direct our40 moral endeavours. This has all changed in the last decade. Developments in the41 neuro-sciences, challenges to the hegemony of rational choice theory, and the42 ascendancy of feminism have meant that philosophy can no longer ignore our43 affective life.44 Has the increased attention that the emotions have received negated their45 somewhat disreputable position? In common with Hutchinson, I would say not. One46 reason why analytic philosophy has eschewed the emotions may be the feeling that47 the traditional tools of the trade are no match for the job. Analytic philosophers48 typically approach a problem in the following manner. First, they survey our49 vernacular usage to find a core cluster of meanings surrounding a concept. Then,50 using thought experiments that often seem absurd to outsiders, they attempt to51 isolate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the proper use of the concept.52 More often than not, this project is conducted in an atmosphere of hushed reverence53 for the methods of the natural sciences, which become the gold standard against54 which philosophers’ endeavours are judged. There are of course significant55 differences between individuals. Some give more weight to philosophical intuitions,56 while others defer to the latest findings of the natural sciences. Since the demise of57 so-called Ordinary Language Philosophy what has united all of these approaches is58 a suspicion towards our vernacular and a preference for theoretical abstraction.59 Yet, while this method may be appropriate for problems in logic, metaphysics60 and philosophy of science, it sits badly with phenomena as fine-grained and61 situation-specific as our emotional lives. I have written elsewhere and at length on62 the problems faced by traditional analytic philosophy in attempting to analyse love.63 (Hamilton, 2006) Unsurprisingly, the same problems emerge with other emotions.64 With a few honourable exceptions, one can only read most contemporary work on65 philosophy of the emotions as evasions of the central problems.66 The contours of the current debate were set a decade ago with the publication of67 Paul Griffith’s bombastic What Emotions Really Are (1997). The book deals with68 many topics, philosophical methodology, philosophy of language, philosophy of69 psychology, even (at a push) moral psychology. But for anyone seeking70 enlightenment on the book’s central topic, the effect is rather like eating a Big71 Mac: momentary satisfaction followed by a sense of cloying disappointment. The72 ultimate answer is that emotions really are whatever some putative future scientific73 psychology of the emotions will tell us that they are.74 Griffith’s book produced numerous responses, some advancing his project in75 different ways, others defending less overtly scientistic positions. The best of these76 responses, notably those of the late Robert Solomon (2003; 2006) and Peter Goldie77 (2000) recognise that whatever light the sciences may throw upon the emotions,R. P. Hamilton123Journal : Small-ext 11158 Dispatch : 22-5-2010 Pages : 10Article No. : 9120 * LE * TYPESETMS Code : RESPBR-14 R CP R DISKUNCORRECTEDPROOF78 their insights will be dimmed if they are not accompanied by a sensitive79 appreciation of the contribution of literature and common experience. The works80 under consideration here both proceed from this recognition.81 I will begin with a consideration of Morgan’s work. His central thesis is that82 shame is an appropriate response to genocide. By this he does not mean the banal83 observation that the perpetrators of genocide ought to feel shame. Rather, his point84 is the bolder one that all of us collectively ought to feel shame at the fact that we85 live in a genocidal world. Countering suggestions from the psychological and86 philosophical literature that shame is always a negative emotion, he argues that the87 appropriate type of shame ought to be a spur to action. He develops this thesis88 through a consideration of the genre of films devoted to the theme of genocide,89 starting with Alan Resnais’s Night and Fog. The central challenge that faces the90 director of any film about genocide is how to portray its horror without slipping into91 voyeurism or sentimentality. Much of the adverse critical reaction to Schindler’s92 List or Life is Beautiful focussed upon the manner in which the directors’ treatment93 trivialised the horror of genocide. Notoriously the shower scene in Spielberg’s film94 involved a portrayal of female nudity which many critics (rightly or wrongly)95 considered exploitative.96 Night and Fog manages to avoid the twin dangers of voyeurism and trivialisation.97 Made in 1955, a decade after the liberation of the camps, Renais was concerned that98 they were already fading from memory. The style of the film, with its interspersing99 of contemporary and newsreel footage, is an attempt, according to Morgan, to100 shame us out of this process of forgetting. He compares Renais’s film with a more101 recent one, Ghosts of Rwanda, which documents in a less artful manner the horrors102 of this more recent African genocide and more particularly the failures of the103 international community to live up to its collective post-Holocaust promise.104 While it is possible to view Night and Fog as an historical document, it is not so105 easy to distance oneself from Ghosts of Rwanda. This film, Morgan suggests, leads106 the viewer to feel not merely sympathy for the victims but a profound sense of107 shame that such events could occur. This sense of shame is deeply connected to a108 loss of face. One would like to see oneself as the kind of person who neither109 perpetrates nor permit genocides and yet genocide has happened once again. Shame,110 then is ‘our own way of seeing ourselves, not through the prism of our actions, but111 through the prism of how others would see us in terms of our features or actions.’112 (Morgan 2008: 15).113 There is, I believe, a central ambivalence in Morgan’s account here. His claim is114 that shame is the appropriate response to the failure of our governments to intervene115 in Rwanda. This raises a number of questions. It is worth noting that shortly after the116 Rwandan genocide and ostensibly as a reaction to it, the US and its allies developed117 a policy of ‘humanitarian intervention’. The first fruit of this policy was the NATO118 bombing of Serbia, in which the US openly supported one party in a civil war, the119 Kosovar Albanians, against their Serbian compatriots. Emboldened by the success120 of this operation, the US and its allies launched their crusades against Afghanistan121 and Iraq. In the latter case, when the chimerical ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction’122 failed to materialise, the pretext rapidly became a humanitarian one.Shaming Philosophy123Journal : Small-ext 11158 Dispatch : 22-5-2010 Pages : 10Article No. : 9120 * LE * TYPESETMS Code : RESPBR-14 R CP R DISKUNCORRECTEDPROOF123 Morgan seems seduced by the liberal illusion that our rulers actually care about124 our opinions. Perhaps one may agree that Western governments should have125 intervened in Rwanda and possibly also at a time when Saddam Hussein was126 butchering the Kurds. The experience of those who opposed the Iraq war127 demonstrates that popular opinion is largely irrelevant to those in power except128 perhaps for those brief periods when they are canvassing for votes. Election time129 comes and goes and a government is returned which carries out policies130 indistinguishable from its predecessor. Does Morgan suppose that if the people of131 Britain, France and Australia had taken to the streets in the millions, the outcome132 would have been different in Rwanda? Anger and frustration seem at least as133 obvious an emotional response as shame.134 This issue touches upon a broader problem with the book. Many of the issues that135 Morgan raises touch upon an ongoing debate in contemporary moral philosophy,136 namely, the extent and limits of personal and collective responsibility. Although he137 never articulates this thought, Morgan seems to be of the persuasion that ‘we’ are138 collectively responsible for the actions of those in power. How this relates to the139 personal shame that a careful reflection upon genocide literature ought to elicit is140 never spelled out. Nor are we ever told in any detail how this shame is supposed to141 translate into political action. This represents a significant failing in the book.142 Let us put political worries aside for the moment. I will focus instead upon the143 broader question of the nature of shame and its relationship to emotions such as144 guilt. While some philosophers have treated shame and guilt as interchangeable,145 Morgan insists upon their distinctness. His suggestion is that the distinction lies in146 the fact that guilt focuses upon our actions rather than ourselves. Shame, he argues,147 is more global in character. While one can feel guilt for what one has done, one can148 do so without thinking less of oneself. Shame, by contrast, forces one to question149 who one is. He further suggests that ‘the feeling of guilt lacks the social dimension150 that shame requires.’ (Morgan, 2008: 46).151 Morgan is correct to stress the distinction between shame and guilt but mistaken152 in the manner in which he draws it. The proper distinction is normative and shame153 and guilt are both distinct and interrelated. It is a mistake to regard any complex154 emotion as more or less social than another. One distinguishes shame from guilt155 partly on the basis of the occasions that typically provoke them and partly by156 conventions of appropriateness. Guilt is in the first instance a forensic concept. One157 can be guilty without feeling guilty whereas one cannot be ashamed without feeling158 shame. Thus, to claim that guilt is less social in character than shame seems odd.159 Guilt is also closely connected with a sense of personal responsibility. To feel160 guilty is to believe, rightly or wrongly, that one has a responsibility for some event161 or situation that one considers blameworthy. As both Morgan and Hutchinson162 highlight, shame is a distressingly common experience among victims of atrocities163 but this need not imply that the victims feel a sense of responsibility for the plight in164 which they found themselves. Shame is a common accompaniment to situations in165 which one is powerless to prevent oneself or someone close to one from becoming a166 victim.167 I also believe that Morgan is mistaken to draw such a stark dichotomy between168 a person’s character and her actions. Although it was a common move inR. P. Hamilton123Journal : Small-ext 11158 Dispatch : 22-5-2010 Pages : 10Article No. : 9120 * LE * TYPESETMS Code : RESPBR-14 R CP R DISKUNCORRECTEDPROOF169 twentieth-century moral philosophy to consider actions in isolation from the agents170 who perform them (at least for the purpose of analysis), the trend in recent decades171 has been to stress the centrality of the person to any account of moral and political172 action. Indeed, the renaissance of the emotions is part of this process. At a time173 when one could talk, without pain of embarrassment, about actions and their174 consequences without reference to the persons whose actions they were or upon175 whom their consequences fell, it was relatively easy to disregard the emotions.176 These questions provide a nice segue into Hutchinson’s book, which treats the177 evasion of the person as central to some of the theoretical problems in philosophy of178 emotions. As mentioned above, of the two works under consideration, Hutchinson’s179 is the more substantial and is at least as much a contribution to central debates in180 moral philosophy and the philosophy of emotions as it is a book about shame.181 Hutchinson clearly writes under the influence of Wittgenstein and especially a set of182 interpretations of Wittgenstein which stress his therapeutic ambition and his183 eschewal of substantive questions. It is a reading associated with inter alia Peter184 Winch, Gordon Baker, and John McDowell. Many readers less sympathetic to185 Wittgenstein, or at least to this particular interpretation, may find this off-putting.186 This will doubtless be exacerbated by Hutchinson’s frequent insistence that he is not187 offering a theory of shame and that his remarks are elucidatory rather than188 substantive.189 Here is not the place to deal with complex questions surrounding the exegesis of190 the later Wittgenstein. Suffice to say that that there are ample insights into both191 shame and the philosophy of the emotions in this book and it would be a pity if192 readers did not delve deep enough to find them. My own impression of the work is193 that the Wittgensteinian framework is rather like the ladder which Wittgenstein194 himself alludes to at the end of the Tractatus. The evidence of this book suggests the195 emergence of a distinctive philosophical voice in the process of moving beyond its196 intellectual origins. It would be a shame if a disdain for Wittgensteinians prevented197 readers from seeing the genuine insights that this book has to offer.198 The book begins with a lengthy discussion of Griffiths’s What Emotions Really199 Are. Although it is more than ten years since its initial publication, Griffiths’s work200 is a seminal one. But, as Hutchinson’s incisive criticisms make clear, it is hard to201 understand why, unless one has a broader understanding of the scientistic climate of202 much current Anglo-American philosophy. Hutchinson identifies Griffiths as a203 particularly strident example of this trend. In keeping with this tradition, Griffiths204 compares recent philosophical work on the emotions to the latest putatively205 scientific findings and surprisingly enough finds the philosophers wanting. He206 argues that the dominant ‘cognitivist’ theory of the emotions, which analyses207 emotions in terms of their distinctive propositional attitudes, is a ‘degenerative208 research programme’ in the Lakatosian sense, before breathlessly proceeding to209 outline what alternative scientific programmes have to offer.210 As Hutchinson suggests, Griffiths’s project begs at least as many questions as it211 answers. To begin with, it is far from clear that philosophy consists of a series of212 ‘research programmes’ whether degenerative or progressive. Moreover, it is unclear213 what the rather loose group of thinkers that Griffiths lumps together have in214 common, except for a refusal to regard the task of philosophy of the emotions as aShaming Philosophy123Journal : Small-ext 11158 Dispatch : 22-5-2010 Pages : 10Article No. : 9120 * LE * TYPESETMS Code : RESPBR-14 R CP R DISKUNCORRECTEDPROOF215 quasi-scientific one. They are cognitivist in that they share to some extent a concern216 with analysing the characteristic judgements and beliefs that accompany the217 emotions, but they vary widely as to the extent they are prepared to assert that this is218 all there is to an emotion. At most they share a common conception that the main219 contribution of philosophy to understanding the emotions is conceptual rather than220 empirical. With some philosophers engaged in conducting poorly constructed221 surveys in the name of ‘Experimental Philosophy’, this is no doubt an unfashionable222 view. However, it is useful to be reminded, as Hutchinson does, that many223 philosophers continue to resist the idea that philosophy is a poor relation to the224 natural and behavioural sciences.225 Unfortunately, Hutchinson has a tendency to show the same lack of charity226 towards his opponents as Griffiths does. I think his critical treatment would have227 been more insightful had he had a more subtle appreciation of the basis of Griffiths’s228 work in philosophy of biology. For instance, Hutchinson attacks Griffiths for using229 the concept of ‘psychological phenotypes’ when dealing with child development230 and suggests that this is merely rhetorical posturing without content. This attack can231 be seen as badly aimed once one appreciates the programme of developmental232 systems theory with which Griffiths is closely associated. Developmental systems233 theory is a radical attempt to rethink the nature-nurture dichotomy. In this context, it234 is entirely appropriate to consider child development in biological terms without235 raising traditional fears of ‘biological reductionism’. Properly understood, Devel-236 opmental Systems Theory is profoundly non-reductive. It is in fact surprising to find237 that a philosopher of biology, whose hallmark is a careful handling of conceptual238 distinctions and a rejection of attempts at theory reduction in biology, can be so239 slapdash when he turns his attention to human affairs. Indeed it is not always clear240 that Griffiths himself fully appreciates the radical nature of the material that he is241 dealing with in biology, in a way that other philosophers of biology, such as John242 Dupre`, clearly do. Some understanding of Griffiths’s work in the philosophy of243 biology would only have strengthened Hutchinson’s case.244 Hutchinson does a better job when it comes to assessing Griffiths’s views in the245 philosophy of language. Although few of his arguments are original, he is able to246 marshal a powerful series of Wittgensteinian insights against Griffiths’s invocation247 of natural kinds semantics. Griffiths is right to argue that our current emotional248 language is not well understood in terms of Putnam and Kripke’s semantic theory,249 not because of the inadequacy of our vernacular (as Griffiths claims) but rather250 because of the incoherence of that theory. It is unfortunate but Hutchinson is251 unlikely to get a fair hearing for his arguments in our current scientistic intellectual252 climate. As he notes, Putnam himself has long resisted the attempt to interpret his253 theory of meaning in essentialist terms, but with little success.254 Many readers unconcerned with contemporary debates in analytic philosophy of255 the emotions will be tempted to skip the first chapter. They will be rewarded by a256 chapter that, in my opinion, is the finest of the book. Hutchinson moves from the257 pristine climate of contemporary Anglo-American thought into the heady air of258 European philosophy. The target here is Giorgio Agamben and the treatment is259 much more dialogic in character than his earlier somewhat polemical handling of260 Griffiths. As he notes, Agamben has a much greater concern for elucidating theR. P. Hamilton123Journal : Small-ext 11158 Dispatch : 22-5-2010 Pages : 10Article No. : 9120 * LE * TYPESETMS Code : RESPBR-14 R CP R DISKUNCORRECTEDPROOF261 lived experience of shame than in constructing quasi-scientific theories of the262 emotions.263 Hutchinson situates Agamben’s account of shame, developed over several works,264 in the context of his broader philosophical and political project. Agamben sees the265 origins of modernity in the collapse of the Aristotelian distinction between zoe and266 bios. In modernity, an attempt is made to base politics upon a bald conception of267 human nature (zoe) and not upon the human beings acting in pursuit of their proper268 ends (bios). The empty formal concept of citizen comes to replace its richer269 Aristotelian predecessor in modern liberal thought. The problem here, as critics such270 as Alasdair MacIntrye (1985) have noted, is that we continue to retain the moral271 categories previously rooted in the Aristotelian framework. Planting them in the272 poor soil that is contemporary liberal theory leads to a failure to flourish.273 This analysis has significant consequences for our understanding of guilt and274 shame. The experience of the Musselma¨nner, those inmates that the system had275 completely defeated whom Levi and other survivors so vividly describe, speaks to276 the possibility of reducing a human being into a mere human animal. Agamben277 further argues that modernity has impoverished our moral discourse in that shame is278 increasingly assimilated to a legalistic concept of guilt. In this light, he offers an279 interpretation of a key passage in Primo Levi’s If This is a Man/The Truce and280 compares it with a later passage from The Drowned and the Saved.281 Levi is discussing the liberation of the camp by Russian soldiers. He describes a282 look on the face of the Russians, a look that is all too familiar to the inmates. It is ‘a283 shame we knew so well, the shame that drowned us after the selections, and every284 time we had to watch, or submit to, some outrage: the shame the Germans did not285 know, that the just man experiences at another’s crimes; the feeling of guilt that286 such a crime should exist, that it should be introduced irrevocably into the world of287 things that exist.’ (Levi, 2000:118).288 Commenting on this, Agamben argues that Levi clearly distinguishes the ethical289 from the juridical. However by the time of his later work, The Drowned and the290 Saved, Levi quotes this passage again and in Agamben’s interpretation of it,291 crucially introduces the expression ‘feels remorse’. He suggests that this represents292 ‘backsliding’ on Levi’s part from his earlier insight. Hutchinson takes issue with this293 interpretation and argues that if there is backsliding taking place it is by Agamben.294 Rather than attempting to take seriously the experience of this most insightful of295 survivors, Agamben seeks to pigeonhole Levi’s account into his theoretical296 framework in which shame is always and everywhere the inescapable awareness of297 one’s own subjectivity. Levi’s literary and expressive power stems in part from his298 sensitivity to the conceptual connections within our everyday language. That he299 resists the legislative pretensions of the philosophers is to his credit. Rather than300 imposing an arbitrary schema, Levi is aware of the resonances of words and the fact301 that concepts like guilt, shame, and remorse are related to one another in302 innumerable ways. One cannot fully understand one of the concepts without303 understanding the similarities and differences to the others.304 Hutchinson offers a similarly perceptive analysis of Agamben’s use of the305 testimony of another survivor, Robert Antelme. In a particularly poignant passage,306 Antelme is describing the death marches at the end of the war. During the march, anShaming Philosophy123Journal : Small-ext 11158 Dispatch : 22-5-2010 Pages : 10Article No. : 9120 * LE * TYPESETMS Code : RESPBR-14 R CP R DISKUNCORRECTEDPROOF307 Italian student is selected for arbitrary execution. Antelme talks about the student’s308 demeanour and states that he ‘seemed embarrassed’ at his selection, going so far as309 to remark upon his blushing. In citing this passage Agamben entirely omits the310 section about embarrassment. Hutchinson suggests that once again, this reflects his311 desire to shoehorn survivor testimony into a pre-existing framework. Rather than312 allowing the survivors’ accounts to speak for themselves they become merely313 vignettes to illustrate Agamben’s broader theoretical analysis.314 In a discussion that many readers will find controversial, Hutchinson identifies315 Agamben’s (mis)reading of Derrida as the culprit. At its best, Derridean deconstruc-316 tion can be an aid to the sluggish imagination, unsettling some of our preconceptions317 about the way language must work. At its worst, deconstruction becomes just another318 metaphysics of presence. In Agamben’s case, this manifests itself in the use of319 etymologies to uncover the ‘essential’ meanings of concepts which then come to320 occupy an existence autonomous of those who use them.321 Hutchinson’s reading of Derrida is surprisingly sympathetic for one obviously322 trained in the Anglo-American tradition and he ably defends him against crass323 criticisms such as those notoriously advanced by John Searle. He interprets324 Derrida’s views on writing as somewhat akin to Wittgenstein’s logico-grammatical325 observations. Agamben, he argues, mistakenly takes Derrrida’s observations as the326 foundations for a new and more correct theory of meaning. In this, despite the many327 differences in outlook and approach, Agamben’s project is not that far from the328 work of a philosopher like Griffiths who seeks to inform ordinary competent329 speakers of the language what our concepts truly mean.330 In the second half of the book, Hutchinson develops his own account of the331 emotions which, in Wittgensteinian spirit, he insists is not a theory. His ‘world-332 taking cognitivism’ is intended to avoid some of the pitfalls in other versions of333 cognitivism and make persons and their experiences central to any understanding of334 the emotions. Emotions are a feature of the world, but not the disenchanted world335 described by the natural sciences. They are rather a feature of a world populated by336 language-using beings such as ourselves who are able to take the world to be a337 certain way and in doing so recognise the ability of others within that world to so338 take it.339 Cognitivist views of the emotions are often criticised for entailing the absurd340 view that one can never be mistaken in one’s emotional responses. I have always341 thought this an oddly misplaced criticism. On the contrary, unlike the longstanding342 view of the emotions within analytic philosophy and psychology as visceral grunts343 at the world of varying degrees of articulacy, cognitivist views, properly understood,344 open up the prospect of both mistaken and correct emotional responses. Within the345 virtue framework that Hutchinson and I broadly share, moral life consists among346 other things in training ourselves to respond appropriately to the world we share347 with our peers. It is not enough simply to go through the motions or abstractly to348 follow rules. We must do so with the appropriate disposition.349 In this light, to experience shame is to respond to features of our common world350 that one takes to appropriately elicit shame. What unites all versions of cognitivism351 is the recognition that our emotional responses are truth-apt. In some versions, he352 argues, this is interpreted in an overly intellectualised way, as the view that allR. P. Hamilton123Journal : Small-ext 11158 Dispatch : 22-5-2010 Pages : 10Article No. : 9120 * LE * TYPESETMS Code : RESPBR-14 R CP R DISKUNCORRECTEDPROOF353 emotional responses embed propositional judgements. Such a view is open to the354 obvious criticism that it ignores the viscerality of many of our emotional responses.355 Hutchinson believes that seeing emotions as answerable to the world (a view which356 he inherits from Charles Travis) avoids this problem.357 In the course of developing his view, Hutchinson attempts to dissolve a number358 of philosophical problems, most especially the ongoing dispute within philosophy of359 emotion regarding the relationship between the viscerality and the intentionality of360 the emotions. (Prinz 2004; Deigh 2004) Philosophers have erected elaborate361 apparatuses to attempt to reconcile this apparent discrepancy and their usual strategy362 in doing so involves ‘imbu[ing] something sub-personal with cognitive powers.’363 (Hutchinson, 2008:125) He ably demonstrates the problems and absurdities in this364 project and the manner in which, once again, it draws us away from persons and the365 world they inhabit. The correct response is to look for the solution within this366 interpersonal world, rather than in some mysterious computational inner world.367 Hutchinson’s position is a distinctive and interesting one, and it is to be hoped368 that he develops it into a broader account of the emotions. Many of his criticisms of369 current philosophical treatment of shame could be applied with equal force to work370 on love or jealousy. At the very least, Hutchinson may be able to perform the time-371 honoured role of a philosophical gadfly urging philosophers not to lose sight of the372 human person in their endless pursuit of a chimerical theoretical clarity.373 Morgan challenges us to feel shame at inhabiting a genocidal world; Hutchison374 attempts to shame philosophers into paying attention to the subtleties of the world375 we share. Both highlight the importance of film and literature in helping us to376 understand our common emotional experience and both are sceptical of the lofty377 imperiousness of overly theorised accounts. Both works are written in a lively and378 engaging style that is a welcome change from the anodyne technicality or379 pretentious bombast of much of the current literature. I fear that they represent a380 minority voice on the fringe of the philosophy of emotions, but I hope that it is a381 growing one.382 Acknowledgment The author is grateful to an anonymous reviewer for his or her stylistic and383 substantive suggestions.384 References385 Deigh, John. 2004.
