ABSTRACT: 
The persistence property of inflation is an important issue not only for economists, but especially for central banks, given that the degree of inflation persistence determines the extent to which central banks can control inflation. Further, not only is it the level of inflation persistence that is important in economic analyses, but also the question of whether the persistence varies over time, for instance, across business cycle phases, is equally pertinent, since assuming constant persistence across states of the economy is sure to lead to misguided policy decisions. Against this backdrop, we extend the literature on long-memory models of inflation persistence for the US economy over the monthly period of 1920:1\u20132014:5, by developing an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic model with a time-varying memory coefficient which varies across expansions and recessions. In sum, we find that inflation persistence does vary across recessions and expansions, with it being significantly higher in the former than in the latter. As an aside, we also show that persistence of inflation volatility is higher during expansions than in recessions. Understandably, our results have important policy implications.

Understandably, the amount of research devoted (and still being carried out), given conflicting results1 in analyzing the inflation persistence property for the US, as well as for other world economies, is voluminous to say the least.2 Though various approaches3 have been used to analyze the degree of inflation persistence, autoregressive fractionally inte- grated moving average (ARFIMA) models is, perhaps, the most popular approach. This is simply because of the fact that the model nests the unit root and stationarity properties of the data, given its generalized form. Not only is it the level of inflation persistence that is important in economic analyses, but also the question of whether the persistence varies over time, for instance, being contingent on the state of the economy, is equally pertinent. This is because, assuming constant persistence across business cycle phases is sure to lead to misguided policy decisions (as well as inaccurate forecasts). Against this backdrop, we extend the literature on long-memory models of inflation persistence for the US economy over the monthly period of 1920:1-2014:5, by developing an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARFIMA-GARCH) model with a time-varying mem- 1 In analyzing the issue of the degree of persistence of the shocks, a related controversy exists concerning the possible existence of a unit root in inflation. On one hand, Nelson and Schwert (1977), Barsky (1987), Ball and Cecchetti (1990), and Brunner and Hess (1993) provide evidence that U.S. inflation contains a unit root. On the other hand, Hassler and Wolters (1995), Baillie et al.(1996), Baum et al. (1999), Bos et al. (1999), Baillie et al. (2002), Hsu (2005), Lee (2005), Ajmi et al. (2008) and Hassler and Meller (2014) among others have found evidence that inflation is fractionally integrated, suggesting that the differencing parameter is significantly different from zero and unity. 2 For a detailed survey in this regard, please refer to Balcilar, Gupta and Jooste (forthcoming) and Martins and Rodrigues (2014). 3 The econometric methods have covered various unit root tests, state-spaced-based time- varying) autoregressive models, and more recently, quantile regressions-based approaches.

Time-Varying Persistence in US Inflation 3 ory coefficient4 which varies across expansions and recessions.5 In sum, we find that inflation persistence does vary across recessions and expansions, with it being significantly higher in the former than in the latter. As an aside, we also show that persistence of inflation volatility, however, is higher during expansions than in re- cessions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses the data and the model, and section 3 is devoted to the results. Finally, section 4 concludes with some policy recommendations. 2 Model and data description We compute US Inflation as a month-on-month percentage change in the US con- sumer price index (CPI) covering the monthly period of 1919:12-2014:5. Under- standably, data on the inflation rate starts from 1920:1. The data on the CPI is sourced from the Global Financial Database. Note that, even though CPI data is available since 1876:1, the starting and end points of the sample coincide with the availability of reliable data at a monthly frequency at the time of writing this paper. To put it alternatively, we dropped the data before 1920, since the computed infla- tion rates over 1876:2 to 1919:12 had large amount of zeros and could possibly have made our results less reliable. The inflation rate data plotted over 1876:2 to 2014:5 vindicates our decision to start the analysis from 1920:1. Given our objective of associating change in persistence with business cycle phases, we also recovered the timing of US recessions from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Table 1 reports the sequence of peaks and troughs on a quarterly basis. As our analyses consider monthly inflation time series, we set the end of recessions (and similarly of expansions) to the last month of the quarters 4 For a detailed survey on ARFIMA models with a time-varying long memory coefficient, the reader is referred to Boutahar et al. (2008) and Aloy et al. (2013). 5 Note that ever since the work of Granger and Hyung (2000), Diebold and Inoue (2001), and Mikosch and Starica (2004), it is well-known that spurious long-memory behavior can be detected in time series known to be theoretically short-memory, due to structural breaks (for a detailed literature review in this regard, refer to Tsay (2008), Tsay and H aÂ¨ rdle (2008) and Hassler and Meller (2014). In our case, we deal with this issue by assuming that the break dates are known and that we have two regimes in expansions and recessions. 4 Massimiliano Caporin, Rangan Gupta Fig. 1 Month-on-month US inflation from 1876:2 to 2014:5. Grey shades identify recession periods. indicated in Table 1. Figure 1 plots the month-on-month inflation rate, along with the recession periods (highlighted by shaded areas). To motivate the need for considering changes in inflation persistence across business cycle phases, we performed a preliminary analysis. In Table 2, we report a descriptive evaluation of the monthly inflation rate by comparing a few indicators, and conditioning on cycles. We note that the average inflation was lower during re- cessions, while the volatility was higher. We also found that inflation was skewed to the left during recessions, and to the right during expansions. This suggest that ex- treme values drove the mean and variance outcomes, given that during recessions we have instances of drops in month-on-month inflation, while during expansions we observe large inflation values. Notably, the inflation density is more leptokurtic during expansions, signalling a higher probability of observing extreme inflation movements.

As in Caporin and Pres (2013), we con- sidered the following estimators of the state-dependent autocorrelation function at lag k, 6 Massimiliano Caporin, Rangan Gupta ÏR (k) = 1 TR(k)âk â T t=k+1 xtxtâkSt 1 TR(k)âk â T t=k+1 x 2 t St (1) ÏE (k) = 1 TE(k)âk â T t=k+1 xtxtâk (1â St) 1 TE(k)âk â T t=k+1 x 2 t (1â St) (2) where xt is the month t inflation rate in deviation from the sample mean, R stands for recession and E for expansion, St is an indicator function assuming the value of 1 during recessions, T is the total sample size, TR (k) is the number of months associated with a recession (âTt=k+1 St = TR (k)), and TE (k) is the number of months where the economy is in expansion, TE (k) = T â TR (k)â k. Note that the quantities in (1) and (2) represent only a preliminary check for the possible presence of changes in the persistence across states of the economy. Moreover, from a methodological point of view, we stress that, by construction, the presence of the indicator function St allows for computing the two serial depen- dence measures focusing on the time t business cycle phase. Therefore, if the lag k is not too large and the cycle phases are not too short, ÏR (k) and ÏE (k) will be based on different samples of data. On the contrary, for large values of k, it is pos- sible that the two serial dependence measures are computed on data belonging to different economic states. Nevertheless, both ÏR (k) and ÏE (k) monitor the depen- dence on past data of the current observation and allow us to verify if a change in the state of the economy influences such a dependence. Therefore, the fact that past data belongs to different cycle phases might have had an effect on the evaluation of the correlations, but this did not prevent an interpretation of the state dependent autocorrelation measures. The two quantities in (1) and (2) will allow anyway to de- termine if past data become more or less important in affecting the current inflation level. The Appendix reports further details on the effect of overlapping regimes on the computation of the state dependent autocorrelation measures ÏR (k) and ÏE (k).

Notably, we have evidence of changes in the persistence over the cyclical phases. The plots suggest that the inflation time series might be characterized by the presence of a long-memory behavior. However, a similar pattern could be generated 8 Massimiliano Caporin, Rangan Gupta by a short-memory process with specific parameter values, such as those of an auto- regressive model with coefficients close to the non-stationarity bound. Further, the reported correlograms do not show clear evidence of seasonal pat- terns. However, seasonal variation is known to generally affect inflation as is shown in Ajmi et al. (2008) and references cited therein. Therefore, we decided to remove the seasonal pattern for our sample starting in 1920:1 with the modified X-13 method of Balcilar, Gupta and Jooste (forthcoming), and Balcilar, Gupta and Uwilingiye (forthcoming), which allowed us to deal with seasonality for data over 50 years of data.6 To shed some light on the possible presence of long-memory and, at the same time, allow for a change in the persistence across states of the economy, we mod- elled the CPI-based inflation rates as in Caporin and Pres (2013), with a Time Vary- ing Auto Regressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (TV-ARFIMA) model. Notably, the model allowed for a change in the memory and, therefore, in the infla- tion persistence over time according to a time-function, such as the change in sea- sons, or conditionally upon a knowledge of changes in the business cycle phases. Let yt be the inflation rate, which we modelled as follows: (1â L)dt Î¦ (L) (yt â Âµ) = Î (L) Îµt (3) where dt is a time varying memory coefficient, Âµ is the unconditional mean of the inflation,Î¦ (L) is an Auto Regressive (AR) polynomial,Î (L) is a Moving Aver- age (MA) polynomial and Îµt is the inflation shock which we assume to be identically and independently distributed with a zero mean and a standard deviation of ÏÎµ. The change in the memory coefficients has a step-wise evolution over time according to changes in the phases of the business cycle. If we denote Rt as the recession dummy, the memory coefficient assumed two possible values: 6 FORTRAN codes used here to conduct seasonal adjustment for long-span data is available upon request from the authors. Time-Varying Persistence in US Inflation 9 dt = ï£±ï£´ï£²ï£´ï£³ dR Rt = 1dE Rt = 0 (4) where dE and dR denote the memory level during expansions and recessions, respectively. In ARMA-type models, we measure the persistence of a series by means of the model parameters and through their role in the moving average infinite represen- tation of the model. Larger persistence means that shocks do produce effects on the series realizations for longer time. In the TVARFIMA model, both long-memory and short-memory parameters affect persistence, as both play a role in the MA(â) model representation. As a consequence, there will be two different degrees of per- sistence over recessions and expansions. However, when comparing persistence across the two states, given that the short-memory parameters are time-invariant, we can reason in a ceteris paribus way. Therefore, the occurrence of equal memory coefficients means equality of persistence across the two business cycle phases. Al- ternatively, a larger (smaller) memory coefficient in one cyclical phase means that this phase has larger (smaller) persistence. Given that the change in persistence varies according to an exogenous variable, and is thus not exactly a function of time, the TVARFIMA model of Caporin and Pres (2013) becomes similar to the Threshold ARFIMA (TARFIMA) of Goldman et al. (2013). However, it differs from the TARFIMA model since the regime change is not associated with the level of the dependent variable (the CPI-based inflation rate), as happens in dynamic models with threshold-driven regimes. On the con- trary, the change in the parameter structure depends on an exogenous variable, which in turn, is the dummy capturing recessions. The model can thus be compared with the approach of Haldrup and Nielsen (2006a,b), and could be considered to be equivalent to a Markov switching model where regimes are known and evolve in a fully independent way. 10 Massimiliano Caporin, Rangan Gupta In order to capture the possible presence of heteroskedasticity, the model was extended by allowing the error variance to change over time according to the TVFI- GARCH model of Caporin and Pres (2009). Therefore, the variance of the inflation shock was denoted as Ï2t and evolved as: Ï2t = Ï+ Î² (L) Ï 2 tâ1 + [ 1â Î² (L)âÎ¨ (L) (1â L)Î»t ] Îµ2t (5) where Î² (L) and Î¨ (L) are short-memory polynomials and Î»t is the variance memory parameter that changes over time according to the business cycle phases as follows: Î»t = ï£±ï£´ï£²ï£´ï£³ Î»R Rt = 1Î»E Rt = 0 (6) where Rt is the recession dummy. Similarly to what was stated for the dynamics of the mean, the persistence of conditional variance depends on both short- and long-memory coefficients. However, short-memory parameters are time-invariant and thus, ceteris paribus, larger values of the long-memory coefficient are indicative of larger persistence. Notably, in the dynamics of both the mean and the variance, the evolution of the persistence affects the current (time t) observation, irrespective of the fact that past data, on which the time t observation depends, belongs to different business cycle phases. What the model provides is a change in the dependence over past data, conditional on the fact that at time t we are in a given economic state. Therefore, depending on the state, the serial correlation might be stronger or weaker, and thus lead to a larger or smaller impact of past observations, irrespective of whether these are associated with an expansion or a recession. Estimation of the models is performed by maximum likelihood methods. The full model can be estimated in a single step but, to simplify the computational com- plexity, a two-step approach is also feasible (at the cost of a loss in efficiency). In Time-Varying Persistence in US Inflation 11 the latter case, we first estimate the mean dynamics (the TV-ARFIMA part of the model) and, conditional on the first step estimation results, we recover mean resid- uals and estimate the variance dynamics (the TV-FIGARCH part of the model). Ca- porin and Pres (2013), by means of a Monte Carlo study, show that small sample performances of maximum likelihood estimators converge to the true parameter values with increasing sample sizes. Moreover, as expected, the estimatorâs density dispersion decreases with the sample size. The authors also provide evidence sup- porting using the model within a forecasting exercise conditional on a knowledge of the evolution of seasons. We stress that a theory for efficiency, consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator for the TV-ARFIMA and TV-FIGARCH models is still missing, as well as a theory for short-memory specifications with time-varying parameters. We point out that those models belong to the broad family of threshold models, among which we can distinguish between specifications where the coefficients change sign according to the modelled variable moving above and below a threshold (self-exiting specifications) and specifications where the change in regimes is due to an exogenous but observable variable, as in our case. While for the former the theory is available, for the latter it is not, as is pointed out by Tong (2011). The model complexity also motivates focussing on the presence of time-variation only in the memory coefficient. From a theoretical point of view, all parameters could be allowed to change over seasons or business cycle phases. However, this increases the number of parameters to be estimated and the computational burden in the modelâs estimation. In this paper, we thus preferred to focus on specifications where only the long-memory coefficients change across business cycle phases. 3 Persistence in US inflation We fitted the TVARFIMA-TVFIGARCH on the monthly inflation time series start- ing from 1920.

Consequently, we estimated ARMA and ARFIMA specifica- tions for the mean, while for the variance, we considered both GARCH and FI- GARCH models. Given that we adopted a two-step estimation strategy, we report separate results for the mean and the variance dynamics. We estimated the compet- ing variance models on the residuals of the most appropriate mean specification.

Q(j) denotes the Ljung-Box test for residual correlation at lag j, for which we report the p-value. We performed the test on squared standardized residuals (mean residuals divided by the estimated conditional standard deviations) to test for the presence of residual heteroskedasticity. LR corresponds to the p-value of the likelihood ratio test for the null of equal memory across the two business cycle phases. Before, we describe the details of the results regarding persistence, we observe the following characteristics of the models estimated: As can be seen from Table 3, residual correlation is found to be present for lags above 12, which could possibly be due to some element in the ACF being quite large. Generalizing the models with higher lags did not improve the results, since these additional coefficients turned out to be statistically insignificant, which in turn, was also vindicated by higher values of the AIC and the BIC. The ARMA specification was found to have a couple of economically significant lags, namely lag-lengths 4 and 7, while the ARFIMA and TVARFIMA were estimated with a lag-length of only 4. In addition, we note that the models required a lag 12 on the MA, which is possibly a by-product of the seasonal adjustment, or due to some stochastic seasonality. Importantly, the LR test was in favour of the TVARFIMA, which in turn, was also confirmed by both the AIC and the BIC. Turning now to the variance specifications in Table 4, the GARCH model is substantially equivalent to TVFIGARCH, both in terms of the standardized residual serial correlation, and in terms of the likelihood. Note that 14 Massimiliano Caporin, Rangan Gupta the TVFIGARCH model is more flexible than the FIGARCH model, as it accounts for time-varying persistence, and a likelihood ratio test indicates a preference for the former. A similar test is not available for the comparison of TVFIGARCH against GARCH, with them being non-nested models. For the FIGARCH model, whose likelihood is inferior to both the GARCH and the TVFIGARCH, we observe that the parameters are significant, as in the other variance specifications. Tables 3 and 4 report the estimated coefficients, and we stress that the memory parameters are always statistically significant. Our empirical results suggests that inflation persistence is changing across business cycle phases, and is higher during recessions. In fact, while the memory coefficient in the mean is equal to 0.477 for recessions, it decreases to 0.303 in periods of expansion. Conversely, the variance persistence moves from 0.299 in recessions up to 0.454 during expansions.7 We be- lieve this is a relevant finding, and is supported by the overwhelming rejection of the Likelihood ratio test for equality of the memory coefficients across the business cycle phases. The null hypothesis is dE = dR, and the test statistic, assumed to be asymptotically distributed as a Chi-square with 1 degree of freedom, provides a p-value less than 0.001. The observation that the persistence is higher in recessions than in expansions might be motivated by the fact that recessions are shorter and more clearly identi- fiable than expansionary phases. Supporting evidence is provided by the average duration of the business cycle phases: while for recessions we have an average du- ration of 14.3 months, for expansions the value increases to 52.3 months. Further, during expansions we might have oscillations in the growth cycle that could affect the persistence. In addition, another line of reasoning could be that while in our model we have two states, in reality we might also have stagnation, which in our analysis, is associated with expansion, and hence, could affect the persistence dur- ing expansion. As an aside, we also show that the persistence of inflation volatility is higher during expansions than during recessions. This is somewhat expected, as 7 These results were also qualitatively the same when we considered the longer sample starting in 1876:2. Complete details of these results are available upon request from the authors. Time-Varying Persistence in US Inflation 15 it implies that volatility persists on low regimes during expansions, while we have greater uncertainty and stronger reactions to shocks during recessions (less persis- tence induces a bigger reaction of volatility to innovations). 4 Concluding remarks Given that the degree of inflation persistence determines the extent to which cen- tral banks can control inflation, the persistence property of inflation is an important issue. Also, not only is it the level of inflation persistence that is important in eco- nomic analyses, but also the question of whether the persistence varies over time, for instance, across business cycle phases, is equally pertinent. This is understand- able since assuming constant persistence across expansionary and contractionary states of the economy is sure to lead to misguided policy decisions. Against this backdrop, we extend the literature on long-memory models of inflation persistence for the US economy over the monthly period of 1920:1-2014:5, by developing an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARFIMA-GARCH) model, with a time-varying mem- ory coefficient that varies across expansions and recessions. In sum, we find that in- flation persistence does vary across recessions and expansions, with it being signif- icantly higher in the former (with the mean of inflation being relatively lower) than in the latter. As an aside, we also show that the persistence of inflation volatility, however, is higher during expansions (with the mean of volatility being relatively lower) than in recessions. Based on our findings, we can deduce the following in terms of monetary policy behaviour, conditioned on expansions or recessions, in the US historically: since higher persistence of inflation and its volatility associates itself with lower mean values of inflation and its volatility, monetary policy seems to be more proactive when the authorities perceive inflation and its volatility to be âtoo highâ on average. When inflation and its volatility are perceived to be low on average, monetary policy is aimed at keeping the levels where they are, implying higher persistence. In other words, the Federal Reserve seems to reduce the level of 16 Massimiliano Caporin, Rangan Gupta inflation during expansions and the volatility of the same during recessions,8 while it tries to stabilize inflation during recessions and its volatility during expansions. Understandably, our results imply that the policy stance of the Federal Reserve to movements in inflation seems to be asymmetric, with it depending on not only its concern with the level or volatility of inflation, but also with whether the economy is in a recession or an expansion. It must be highlighted here that, besides price stability, the Federal Reserve is also concerned with the output gap. Given this, our discussion on its response to inflation is not foolproof, but with the analysis con- ditioned on business cycle phases, we accommodate for the mandate of maximum sustainable output and employment simultaneously in an implicit fashion.

Note that we re-labelled states as 0 and 1 to be more general. We postulated that the zero-mean series xtâs dynamic behaviour changes over time and moves between two states or regimes. The variable St monitors the states evolution, and takes value 0 in the first state and value 1 in the second state. We refer to the previous expressions as the estimators of the State-Dependent Auto Correlation Functions. This Appendix discusses two aspects. Firstly, the appropriateness of the state-dependent Auto Correlation Functions to highlight differences in the serial dependence across states. Secondly, we note that the estimation of the state-dependent Auto Correlation Functions following the above reported estimators might suffer for distortions due to the fact that observations xt and xtâk might belong to two different states. We evaluated the impact of those distortions. We tackled the two points by means of simulations, computing the average, across simulations, or the empirical ACF obtained from simulated series. We believe that the derivation of the theoreti- cal expressions of the state-dependent ACF is beyond the scopes of the present paper and postpone that to future contributions. We simulated data from the following TVARFIMA stochastic process (1â L)dt xt = Îµt with Îµt distributed as a standardized Normal, and dt = ï£±ï£²ï£³ d0 St = 0d1 St = 1 . Moreover, we assumed that the variable St moves from one state to the other every M obser- vations. Further, we noted that if d0 = d1 the model collapsed to an ARFIMA(0,d,0). We first show that the ACF of the TVARFIMA computed on the full sample is a mixture of the ACF of the TVARFIMA computed on the two states. We thus estimated and averaged the ACFs of the TVARFIMA process over N = 500 simulated series, characterized by a change of state every M = 50 observations. We assumed that the timing of the state change is known. For those series Time-Varying Persistence in US Inflation 21 Fig. A.1 Simulated empirical ACF from TVARFIMA with two states, with memory coefficients d = 0.45 and d = 0.1, respectively. Fig. A.2 Simulated empirical ACF from TVARFIMA with two states, with memory coefficients d = 0.4 and d = 0.2, respectively. we considered a sample size of T = 1000 observations. Note that in the simulation we adopted a pre-sample of T observations to control for the dependence on initial values. We considered two cases: d0 = 0.45 and d1 = 0.1; d0 = 0.4 and d1 = 0.2. We provided two plots, Figure A.1 and A.2, where we report the empirical ACFs (averaged across the N simulations) for the full sample as well as those computed on each state according to the above-reported estimators. From the two figures, it emerged clearly how the full sample ACF lies in the middle between the ACFs computed on the two states. The ACFs get closer when the persistence of the two states is closer, as we might have expected. Consequently, identifying long-range dependence by means 22 Massimiliano Caporin, Rangan Gupta Fig. A.3 Simulated state-dependent empirical ACF from TVARFIMA with two states, with memory coefficients d = 0.45 and d = 0.1, respectively. of a full-sample ACF might not have allowed us to detect the presence of two states characterized by very different memory degrees, as Figure A.1 shows. We now move to the evaluation of the effect associated with the introduction in the computa- tion of state-dependent ACF of observations belonging to different regimes. For that purpose we compared the estimators we proposed with the alternative ones reported below: Î´0 (k) = 1 TR(k)âk â T t=k+1 xtxtâkStStâk 1 TR(k)âk â T t=k+1 x 2 t StStâk , Î´1 (k) = 1 TE(k)âk â T t=k+1 xtxtâk (1â St) (1â Stâk) 1 TE(k)âk â T t=k+1 x 2 t (1â St) (1â Stâk) . These two competing estimators differ from the one we previously adopted in the sense that the pairs of observations xtxtâk contribute to the evaluation of the ACF only if they both belong to the same state. We provide then simulated empirical ACF (averaging across simulations) using the same data generating process previously adopted. The following two figures, Figure A.3 and A.4, focus on the two different generators. By analyzing the figures, we note that the state-dependent ACFs are contaminated by the pres- ence of observations belonging to different states. In fact, the ACF for the higher memory states is downward biased, being contaminated by observations coming from a state with lower memory. We observe the opposite effect on the ACF of the lower memory state. This effect is, obviously, more evident if we have states with closer memory degree, or if one of the two states has very low memory. Time-Varying Persistence in US Inflation 23 Fig. A.4 Simulated state-dependent empirical ACF from TVARFIMA with two states, with memory coefficients d = 0.4 and d = 0.2, respectively. While on the one side this evidence could suggest the use of Î´0 and Î´1 in place of Ï0 and Ï1, we must stress that the evaluation of Î´0 and Î´1 is limited by the size of the observed states. In fact, if states have, in a limiting case, an equal size of M observations, the maximum lag for which we can compute Î´0 and Î´1 is exactly M, but at the cost of sensibly reducing the accuracy of the estimators for lags close to M, due to the limited number of pairs xtxtâk contributing to their evaluation. In practice, we might compute the estimators up to a fraction of M. Consequently, the use of Ï0 and Ï1 is advisable, as they could allow for evaluating the state dependent ACFs, even if the duration of states is limited. We must, however, advise the user on the presence of the distortions due to the inclusion, in the estimator evaluation, of observations belong- ing to different states. Nevertheless, as the state-dependent ACF should be adopted only within an identification step, and thus should be preliminary to any estimation, we do believe that the pres- ence of distortions will have a limited impact. Those ACF would just suggest a possible presence of states with differing memory degrees, and only a model estimation would allow making a final decision.
