ABSTRACT: 
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the associations between migration status and health-related outcomes and to examine whether and how the effect of migration status changes when it is disaggregated by length of residence, first language, reason for migration and combined with ethnicity. DESIGN: A total of 1698 adults were interviewed from 1076 randomly selected households in two South London boroughs. We described the socio-demographic and socio-economic differences between migrants and non-migrants and compared the prevalence of health-related outcomes by migration status, length of residence, first language, reason for migration and migration status within ethnic groups. Unadjusted models and models adjusted for socio-demographic and socio-economic indicators are presented. RESULTS: Migrants were disadvantaged in terms of socio-economic status but few differences were found between migrant and non-migrants regarding health or health service use indicators; migration status was associated with decreased hazardous alcohol use, functional limitations due to poor mental health and not being registered with a general practitioner. Important differences emerged when migration status was disaggregated by length of residence in the UK, first language, reason for migration and intersected with ethnicity. The association between migration status and functional limitations due to poor mental health was only seen in White migrants, migrants whose first language was not English and migrants who had moved to the UK for work or a better life or for asylum or political reasons. There was no association between migration status and self-rated health overall, but Black African migrants had decreased odds for reporting poor health compared to their non-migrant counterparts [odds ratio = 0.15 (0.05-0.48), p < 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: Disaggregating migration status by length of residence, first language and reason for migration as well as intersecting it with ethnicity leads to better understanding of the effect migration status has on health and health service use.

IntroductionUnderstanding the health of migrants is becoming progressively important as theproportion of people living outside their country of birth has continued to increaseglobally (United Nations 2013). Definitions of ‘migrant’ vary among different datasources, datasets and law (Anderson and Blinder 2013). For the purposes of this paper,*Corresponding author.

The moral rights of the namedauthor(s) have been asserted.the term migrant is used in the broadest sense and refers to all persons residing outsidetheir country of birth in order to understand the effects of migration status on health andhealth service use, while considering the importance of other migration-related factorssuch as length of residence. Further, migrants from different countries relocate for avariety of reasons across different points in the life course; there is not simply onemigrant narrative that leads to a shared experience in host countries. In the UK, themigrant population currently stands at 12% while the proportion in London is muchlarger at 37% (Office for National Statistics 2013). South-east London is a centre formany migrant communities in London. Brixton, a neighbourhood in the London boroughof Lambeth, has been a hub for migrants from the Caribbean since 1948, and theboroughs of Southwark and Lambeth have continued to attract migrant communities,particularly large West African and South American communities (Lambeth Council2012). More recently, the migrant population in London is increasingly diverse andglobalised. Not only are people moving to London to escape persecution, to make a betterlife or be with family, but also wealthy people are coming here to take advantage of thebenefits London provides as a global centre (May et al. 2007). This heterogeneity hasimplications for understanding the relationship between migration status and health.Therefore, methodologically, it is important to disaggregate migration status andinvestigate how migration status combines with other social statuses to affect health.Most research has addressed this by focusing on migrant sub-groups with specifictrajectories, such as asylum seekers or refugees and the impact of migration on health(Jayaweera 2011), but this limits our understanding of how migration status affects healthin a wider sense and how this intersects with potentially important social statuses, such asethnicity (Kobayashi, Prus, and Lin 2008), language proficiency (Okafor et al. 2013) andsocio-economic status (SES; Malmusi, Borrell, and Benach 2010).1.1. Migration status and healthResearch findings on migrant health and health service use are often contradictory(Rechel et al. 2013). In North America, many studies have observed better self-ratedhealth (Argeseanu Cunningham, Ruben, and Venkat Narayan 2008), less limitation indaily activities (Lucas, Barr-Anderson, and Kington 2003) and fewer symptoms ofpsychological distress (Dey and Lucas 2006) in migrants compared to their non-migrantcounterparts. In contrast, across Europe, many studies have observed poorer self-ratedhealth for migrants compared to non-migrants (Nielsen and Krasnik 2010), whilst there isa lack of research for other health indicators (Bhopal 2012). In the UK, most research hasbeen local and qualitative, often concentrating on asylum seekers and refugees(Jayaweera 2011). Recent national data-sets have primarily focused on ethnicity ratherthan migrant status (Marmot et al. 2010) and past quantitative research is based mostly onmortality studies rather than health survey data (Marmot, Shipley, and Rose 1984).Notable exceptions highlight lower rates of mental illness in migrants compared to non-migrants (Nazroo 1997), higher rates of schizophrenia in Caribbean migrants living inSouth-east London compared to non-migrants (Bebbington, Hurry, and Tennant 1981),while no association was found between migration status and depression in older adults inLondon (Livingston et al. 2001) or between migration status and poor general health inthe Millennium Cohort Study, a UK longitudinal birth cohort study (Jayaweera andQuigley 2010). In addition, there are relatively few studies that look at health service useEthnicity & Health 565for migrants. Quantitative research that does exist on health service use has highlightedvariations across the European Union, with a recent review highlighting the need formore epidemiological data (Norredam, Nielsen, and Krasnik 2010). In the UK, recentmigrants have been shown to be less likely to be registered with a general practitioner(GP; Stagg et al. 2012) and less likely to use secondary health services (Steventon andBardsley 2011) than non-migrants.A number of studies have indicated that recent migrants are often healthier than theirnative born hosts, but that migrants’ health often deteriorates with length of stay in thehost country (Hill et al. 2012). Acculturation [changes that take place among migrantsdue to contact with culturally dissimilar groups and influences, such as the uptake of riskyhealth behaviours (Hawkins et al. 2008)] has been posited as an explanatory process forthis deterioration (Hill et al. 2012). Linear deterioration of self-rated health in migrantshas been observed in a UK sample but there were no associations between length ofresidence and health behaviours (Jayaweera and Quigley 2010). However, a lineardeterioration in health is not always observed and the effects vary when migration statusand ethnicity are intersected (Dey and Lucas 2006). Language proficiency is also oftenused as a proxy for acculturation and limited English proficiency has been found to beassociated with both lower rates of mental illness in the UK (Nazroo 1997) and poor self-rated health in African migrants in the USA (Okafor et al. 2013). Indeed, there isincreasing criticism of acculturation as an explanation for health inequalities in migrantsand a shift away from individual level concepts to more structural explanations, such asSES and social construction of multiple identities. These identities can be highlycontradictory leading to uneven processes of advantage and disadvantage or exclusionand inclusion that vary across national borders (Anthias 2008).1.2. Intersections with ethnicity and SESPrevious work treating migrants as a homogenous group has been criticised and it hasbeen proposed that to further understand the social determinants of migrant health, anintersectional approach is needed (Viruell-Fuentes, Miranda, and Abdulrahim 2012).Intersectionality is a methodology of studying ‘the relationships among multipledimensions and modalities of social relationships and subject formations’ (McCall2005). It does not treat social categories as discrete and non-interacting but as categoriesthat operate together to produce inequality. Ethnicity and SES are two social statuses thatare likely to be important in this regard (Bhugra 2004; Nazroo et al. 2007).Although ethnic inequalities in health are well documented (Hatch et al. 2011;Marmot et al. 2010; Sproston, Mindell, and Becker 2006), there are relatively few studiesthat investigate the effect of migration status on health within ethnic groups. Research inCanada found that foreign-born South Asian and Chinese groups were more likely tohave worse self-rated health and increased odds of functional limitations than theirCanadian-born counterparts whereas the opposite was true in white French and Blackmigrants (Kobayashi et al. 2008). In the USA, Black Caribbean migrants had lower ratesof psychiatric disorder compared to their non-migrant counterparts (Williams et al. 2007).In the UK, there is a lack of data on how migration status affects health across differentethnic groups. However, other structural factors, such as SES, have been shown to affectthe relationship between ethnicity and health (Nazroo et al. 2007) and may contribute tothe relationship between ethnicity, migration status and health.566 B. Gazard et al.Associations between migration status, ethnicity and health cannot be explainedwithout taking account of SES as it structures differential access to power, privilege andresources, which are fundamental for health (Link and Phelan 1995). Research hassuggested that higher rates of anxiety in Turkish and Moroccan migrants compared tonon-migrants in the Netherlands are largely explained by SES (Levecque, Lodewyckx,and Vranken 2007) and that migrants living in economic deprivation in Spain have poorerself-rated health than non-migrants (Malmusi et al. 2010). Taking into account reasons formigration may also be important in understanding these associations. Improving SESthrough employment or education is a dominant rational for migration (Blinder 2013),and unfulfilled expectations in realising these goals may be linked to depressivesymptoms (Vega, Kolody, and Valle 1987). Despite this, there is scarce quantitativeresearch exploring the association between reason for migration and health and healthservice use.In response to calls in the literature for a more structural and intersectional approachto understanding migrant health, the objectives of this study are (1) to describe the socio-demographic and socio-economic differences between migrants and non-migrants asbroad groupings and by ethnicity, as well as within migrant groups by length of residencein the UK; (2) to investigate the associations between migration status and health-relatedoutcomes, including health behaviours, functional limitations, physical and mental healthstatus and health service use; and (3) to examine whether and how the effect of migrationstatus changes when it is disaggregated by length of residence, first language, reason formigration and combined with ethnicity.2. Methods2.1. Study design and participantsThe South East London Community Health (SELCoH) study is a community survey ofpsychiatric and physical morbidity of 1698 individuals, from 1075 randomly selectedhouseholds from two boroughs in South-east London, Lambeth and Southwark (Hatchet al. 2011). Data were collected from 2008 to 2010. Households were identified throughrandom sampling using the Small User Postcode Address File. All individuals who were16 years and over living in the selected households were invited to participate. Participantscompleted a computer-assisted survey with trained interviewers; interpreters wereavailable where necessary. Professional interpreters, booked through the South Londonand Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service (NHS) trust, were used in interviews with34 non-English speaking adults. The languages were Spanish, Portuguese, Polish,Turkish, French, Italian, Pashto, Twi, Bengali, Gujarati, Japanese, Russian, Ukrainianand Urdu.The household participation rate was 51.9% with 71.9% participation of eligibleindividuals within households. The sample was similar to the most recent UK Censusinformation in 2011 with regards to socio-demographic and socio-economic indicators forthe catchment area under study (Office for National Statistics 2011). The boroughs areethnically diverse, with large Caribbean, West African and South American communities(Lambeth Council 2012). The study received approval from the King’s College Londonresearch ethics committee, reference CREC/07/08-152.Ethnicity & Health 5672.2. Measures2.2.1. Health behavioursHazardous alcohol use was measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test(AUDIT; Babor et al. 1992). The measure contains 10 questions related to consumption,dependence and problems related to alcohol abuse. Each item is scored from 0 to 4, witha total score ranging from 0 to 40. An AUDIT score of 8 or more has been used to definehazardous alcohol use. Participants were classified as current smokers if they answeredthat they were currently smoking. Participants reported illicit drug use in the past monthfor the following drugs: cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, crack, ecstasy, lysergic aciddiethylamide (LSD), tranquilliser and heroin. Any drug use in the past month referred touse of at least one drug in the past month.2.2.2. Physical and mental health statusSelf-rated general health was indicated by a single item in the 12-item Short Form(SF-12) questionnaire (Ware Jr, Kosinski, and Keller 1996). Participants rated theiroverall health as poor, fair, good, very good or excellent and responses were re-categorised into a binary variable (poor or fair health versus good, very good or excellenthealth). Participants were classified as having a long-standing illness if they indicated thatthey had a long-standing illness, disability or infirmity that troubled them over a periodof time.Common mental disorder (CMD) was assessed with the Revised Clinical InterviewSchedule (CIS-R), a structured interview that enquires about the following symptoms:fatigue, sleep problems, irritability, worry, depression, depressive ideas, anxiety, obsessions,memory and concentration, somatic symptoms, compulsions, phobias, physical healthworries and panic. A total CIS-R score of 12 or more is commonly used to indicate thepresence of CMD (Lewis et al. 1992).2.2.3 Functional limitationsThree individual items from the SF-12 were also used to indicate functioning. Functionallimitations due to physical health represented participants who indicated that theirphysical health limited their work or other activities in the last four weeks. Functionallimitations due to emotional problems represented those participants who indicated thatthey had accomplished less due to their emotional problems in the last four weeks.Finally, participants indicated how much of the time their physical or emotional problemshad interfered with their social activities. The responses were categorised as none of thetime; a little/some/a bit of the time; and most or all of the time.2.2.4 Health service useParticipants were asked if they were currently registered with a GP and if they had seen aGP, counsellor or mental health specialist regarding an emotional problem in the last12 months. Participants were also asked if they had used any hospital services (accidentand emergency and other outpatient departments) in the last 12 months.568 B. Gazard et al.2.2.5 Socio-demographic indicatorsThe socio-demographic indicators used in the analysis include gender, age and ethnicity.Self-reported ethnicity indicated identification with one of the following groups: White,Black African, Black Caribbean, Black Other, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese orOther. Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Black Other and Other were collapsedinto an ‘Other ethnic group’ category due to small cell sizes. Migrant status was capturedas born in the UK or not; length of residence in the UK (0–4 years, 5–10 years and morethan 10 years) and reason for migration (education, work/better life, to be with family orfor relationship, asylum or political reasons). Participants were also asked whether or notEnglish is their first language.2.2.6 Socio-economic indicatorsThe socio-economic indicators in the analysis were educational attainment, employmentstatus and household income. Educational attainment was classified into the followinggroups: no qualifications, up to GCSE level or equivalent, up to advanced level orequivalent (high school equivalent), higher (university) degree or above. Employmentstatus was classified into the following four categories: employed (full time or part time),unemployed, student and other (retired, temporary sick, permanent sick/disabled orlooking after the home with children). Participants reported annual household incomebefore deductions for income tax and National Insurance based on the following fivecategories: (1) £0–£5475, (2) £5476–£12,097, (3) £12,098–£20,753, (4) £20,754–£31,494 and (5) £31,495 or more.2.3. Statistical analysesAnalyses were conducted in STATA 11 (StataCorp 2009). We used survey commands(svy) for estimates of prevalence and associations where appropriate to generate robuststandard errors. This analysis accounted for clustering by household, and data wereweighted for non-response bias within households. Frequencies are reported un-weighted. To describe socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics ofmigrants and non-migrants, frequency and prevalence estimates were reported (meanand standard error were used for reporting age) for the sample stratified by (1)migration status and length of residence in the UK and (2) by migration status withinethnic groups. To identify associations between migration status and outcome measures,prevalence estimates, odds ratios (ORs) from logistic regression models and relativerisk ratios (RRRs) from multinomial logistic regression models with 95% confidenceintervals were calculated.Models were tested to investigate the effect of (1) migration status, (2) length ofresidence in the UK, (3) first language, (4) reason for migration and (5) migration statuswithin each ethnic group category (comparing migrants to non-migrants within eachethnic group) for all outcomes. Two models are presented, unadjusted and fully adjustedfor age (as a continuous variable), gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, work status,household income and a cumulative score of all three health behaviours (detailed fullyadjusted models are available in the Online appendix). Due to smaller group sizes inmodels combining migration status and ethnicity, the following potential confounderswere re-coded into dichotomous variables in the fully adjusted models: educationalEthnicity & Health 569attainment (1 = advanced level or above), employment status (1 = working) andhousehold income (1 = £31,395 and above). Analysis is based on 1669 participants whoanswered a question on country of birth, 659 (39.3%) of whom were born outside theUK. This is similar to the most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) information(39.1%) for Southeast London (Office for National Statistics 2013).3. Results3.1. Migrant and non-migrant characteristicsTable 1 describes the prevalence estimates and means for migration status indicators bysocio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Migrants tended to report highereducational attainment but lower household income levels than non-migrants. Within themigrant sample, 56.9% of the population had been living in the UK for more than10 years. Notably, the distribution of ethnic groups and first language changed over time.A greater proportion of newer migrants (residing in the UK for less than 5 years) wereWhite while a greater proportion of those residing in the UK for 5–10 years were BlackAfrican. The most recent migrant group had a lower proportion of migrants whose firstlanguage was English compared to migrants who had resided in the UK longer. In termsof socio-economic indicators, migrants who had been residing in the UK for more than10 years had lower educational attainment than more recent migrants. Education was themost common reason for migration among the most recent migrants, whereas migratingto be with family was more common among migrants who have been residing in the UKlonger.3.2. Migrant and non-migrant characteristics by ethnicityTable 2 shows the characteristics of migrants and non-migrants by ethnic group. Acrossall ethnic groups, migrants’ mean age was higher than non-migrants with the exception ofthe White group. Within the Other ethnic group (n = 268), 13.4% identified as Indian,12.6% identified as Black Other, 7.6% identified as Pakistani, 8.4% identified as Chinese,3.1% identified as Bangladeshi and 55.0% identified as Other (not shown). Of the153 participants who identified as Other ethnicity, 41.7% were born in the UK, 18.9%were born in Asian countries, 18.2% were born across the Americas, 13.4% were born inAfrican countries and 7.9% were born in Europe (not shown). There were differences insocio-economic indicators within the different ethnic groups. Migrants and non-migrantsin the White ethnic group were generally similar; however, migrants tended to havehigher educational attainment. Migrants within the Black Caribbean group were moredisadvantaged than non-migrants for all indicators. Migrants in the Black African andOther groups had similar levels of educational attainment as their non-migrant counter-parts, yet both groups of migrants also had lower proportions in the higher householdincome categories.3.3. Health behavioursAs indicated in Table 3, in the unadjusted model, migrants had decreased odds ofhazardous alcohol use, current smoking and illicit drug use in the past month compared tonon-migrants.

In comparison to non-migrants, migrants who hadbeen residing in the UK for more than five years also had decreased odds of reporting allthree risky health behaviours in unadjusted models. In adjusted models, these associationswere attenuated in migrants who had been residing in the UK for more than 10 years.Although there were no associations identified between migrants who had been residingin the UK for less than five years and any of the risky health behaviours in unadjustedmodels, there was an association with hazardous alcohol use after adjusting for potentialconfounders.In unadjusted models, migrants whose first language was not English had decreasedodds of hazardous alcohol use, current smoking and illicit drug use in the past monthwhile migrants whose first language was English only had decreased odds of currentsmoking compared to non-migrants. The association with current smoking was attenuatedafter controlling for potential confounders. In unadjusted models, those who migrated foreducation, to be with family or for asylum or political reasons, all had decreased odds ofhazardous alcohol use compared to non-migrants. These associations were attenuated inthose who migrated for political reasons in adjusted models. Those who migrated foreducation or to be with family also had decreased odds of current smoking compared tonon-migrants. However, both associations were attenuated after adjusting for potentialconfounders. Those who migrated for work had decreased odds of illicit drug usecompared to non-migrants in the unadjusted model but this association was attenuated inthe fully adjusted model.Compared to their non-migrant counterparts within the same ethnic group, migrants inthe Other ethnic group had decreased odds of hazardous alcohol use and Black Caribbeanmigrants had decreased odds of illicit drug use in the past month. However, bothassociations were attenuated in the fully adjusted model. Although there was noassociation between migration status and hazardous alcohol use in the White ethnicgroup in the unadjusted model there was an association in the fully adjusted model afteradjusting for potential confounders.3.4. Physical and mental health statusAs indicated in Table 4, no associations between migration status and mental or physicalhealth status were identified. However, migrants who had been residing in the UK formore than 10 years had increased odds of rating their health as fair or poor and indicatingthe presence of a long-standing illness compared to non-migrants. These associationswere attenuated after controlling for potential confounders. In comparison, migrants whohad resided in the UK for 10 years or less had decreased odds for these two healthoutcomes compared to non-migrants. Again, these associations were fully attenuated afteradjusting for confounders.In unadjusted models, those who migrated for education had decreased odds of bothpoor or fair self-rated health and reporting a long-standing illness compared to non-migrants. These associations were attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders. Inthe fully adjusted model, those who migrated for political reasons had increased odds ofreporting CMD compared to non-migrants.

Increased odds offunctional limitations due to poor mental health were also observed in migrants whosefirst language was not English compared to non-migrants in both unadjusted and adjustedmodels.In fully adjusted models, those who migrated for work or political reasons hadincreased odds of functional limitations due to poor mental health compared to non-migrants. In comparison to non-migrants within the same ethnic group, White migrantshad increased odds of functional limitation due to poor mental health and Black Africanmigrants had increased odds of functional limitation due to poor physical health.However, the association for Black African migrants was attenuated after adjusting forpotential confounders.3.6. Health care service useAs indicated in Table 6, migrants had increased odds of not being currently registeredwith a GP compared to non-migrants in both unadjusted and adjusted models. In moredetailed indicators of migrant status, this association was only observed in migrants whohad been residing in the UK for less than five years, White migrants and those whomigrated for education or work. In adjusted models, migrants who had been in the UK for5–10 years had increased odds of seeing a GP for an emotional problem compared tonon-migrants while those who had resided in the UK for less than five years haddecreased odds. In addition, those who had migrated for education had increased odds ofvisiting an outpatient department compared to non-migrants in the fully adjusted model.In indicators combining migration status and ethnicity, decreased odds of seeing a GP foran emotional problem were observed in migrants in the Other ethnic group compared totheir non-migrant counterparts in the fully adjusted model.4. DiscussionUsing data from the SELCoH study, we aimed to describe and compare the socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics of migrants and non-migrants in South-east London and to investigate the relationship between migration status and healthbehaviours, physical and mental health status, functional limitations and health serviceuse. Compared to non-migrants, migrants were disadvantaged in terms of householdincome despite higher levels of educational attainment, and migration status wasassociated with functional limitations due to poor mental health and not being registeredwith a GP. Important differences emerged when migration status was disaggregated bylength of residence in the UK, first language, reason for migration and intersected withethnicity. The association between migration status and functional limitations due to poormental health was only seen in migrants whose first language was not English, those whomigrated for work or a better life and White migrants. There was no association betweenmigration status and self-rated health overall, but Black African migrants and migrants inthe Other ethnic group had decreased odds for reporting poor health compared to theirnon-migrant counterparts. These results demonstrate the methodological importance ofdisaggregating migrant status and the use of intersectional theory in identifying healthinequalities.Ethnicity & Health 583Table 6.

Key resultsIn the current study, migrants were found to have similar health outcomes to non-migrants. This is in contrast to previous studies across North America and Europe. In theUSA and Canada, the majority of studies find migrants to be in better health (ArgeseanuCunningham et al. 2008); whereas in Europe, many studies find migrants to be in worsehealth (Nielsen and Krasnik 2010). In the UK, migrants from some ethnic groups havebeen shown to have decreased odds of reporting poor health compared to their secondgeneration counterparts after adjusting for SES (Smith, Kelly, and Nazroo 2009). Thesedifferences may be the result of arriving from varying geographical contexts but are alsolikely to differ due to the broad term ‘migrant’ masking the diversity of migrant groups.Constantly changing migration patterns have implications for how migrants arereceived by the host society. Within this sample, a greater proportion of the most recentmigrants identified as White and a smaller proportion identified as Black African orBlack Caribbean compared to migrants who had been residing in the UK for more thanfive years, reflecting more recent migration patterns from both original EU member statesand EU Accession states. Although the majority of recent migrants reported education orwork as the reason for migration, the UK population’s perception of migrants is verydifferent. A survey conducted on a representative sample of the British adult populationfound that 62% thought of refugees or asylum seekers and 29% thought of students whenthinking of migrants despite students representing the largest group coming to the UKand asylum seekers and refugees being the smallest group (in 2009; The MigrationObservatory 2011). In addition, the British Social Attitudes survey, a representativesample of the British population, found that there was less openness to migrants fromnon-White ethnic groups (with the exception of Bulgarian and Romanians; the mostrecent members of the EU; Ford 2011). Perceptions and expectations of migrants inSouth-east London are likely to have an impact on migrants’ experiences and be animportant factor in understanding the relationship between migration status and health.Indeed, ascribing characteristics and behaviours to such a heterogeneous group can beproblematic. In the UK, current political rhetoric on ‘health tourism’ implies that migrantschoose to move to the UK to use free health services (Hampshire 2005), yet recent studieshave suggested that migrants use fewer services than the native born population (Stagget al. 2012; Steventon and Bardsley 2011). Although the current study found thatmigrants are less likely to be registered with a GP than non-migrants, we did not find anydifferences in health service use overall. The passing of the Immigration Act 2014, whichputs a framework in place for a new NHS charging structure for migrants in the UK,could have serious implications for more vulnerable migrants such as undocumentedmigrants and refused asylum seekers (Department of Health 2013). Deterring migrantswith complicated immigration status from accessing services could have widespreadpublic health implications. The ‘healthy migrant’ effect has been shown to deterioratewith length of stay in host country due to acculturation (Hill et al. 2012). However, in thiscurrent study, any health advantage recent migrants have in terms of self-rated health isattenuated after adjusting for age and educational attainment (detailed fully adjustedmodels are available in the Online appendix). Conversely, migrants who had been in theUK for more than 10 years (those with most SES disadvantage) had increased odds ofreporting fair or poor health compared with non-migrants. This disadvantage disappearedafter controlling for age, ethnicity and household income suggesting that SES is animportant factor in the relationship between migration status and health. In both these588 B. Gazard et al.examples, adjustments for health behaviours made no difference to the models. At thesame time, an association between migration status and functional limitations due to poormental health was found for migrants whose first language was not English. In thisassociation, language proficiency may not be acting as a proxy for acculturation butsimply relating to the ability to communicate (Gee, Walsemann, and Takeuchi 2010). Thismay also explain the same association for White migrants as 56% of White migrants’ firstlanguage was not English. Discrimination based on language has also been shown to be arisk factor for poor health in the USA (Yoo, Gee, and Takeuchi 2009) and could be apossible explanatory factor in this sample. Findings from this current study do not supportindividual level concepts of acculturation adding to a body of research that calls for morefocus on structural factors in understanding the role of migration status in healthinequalities (Viruell-Fuentes et al. 2012).Interestingly, although there was no association between migration status and CMD,there was an association with functional limitations due to poor mental health. Ondisaggregating migration status, the association was only found for those whose firstlanguage was not English (as described above), White migrants, and those whomigrated for work or a better life. Frustration in relation to unfulfilled expectations hasbeen related to poor mental health in migrant groups previously (Vega et al. 1987) andmay explain the association within those who migrate for work or a better life. Thisfrustration due to unfulfilled expectations is also likely to be linked to the increasedodds for migrants who have resided in the UK for 5–10 years to see a GP about anemotional problem as this group had twice the odds of reporting functional limitationsdue to poor mental health compared to non-migrants. Decreased odds for the mostrecent migrants to see a GP may possibly be affected by a higher proportion not beingregistered with a GP. In this sample, it may be that the one item question to assessfunctional limitation due to poor mental health was more sensitive to migrant’s feelingsof accomplishing less than they expected rather than the interview schedule used togauge CMD. It has been reported that migrants selectively report on their lives due toexpectations (Massey 2006), and this may be a topic that needs further exploration inunderstanding migration status and its relation to CMD and functional limitations due topoor mental health.In the current study, we were also able to show that many of the relationships betweenmigrant status and health-related outcomes differed when migration status was intersectedwith ethnicity. In particular, Black African migrants and migrants from the Other ethnicgroup were less likely to report fair or poor health than their non-migrant counterparts.This does not reflect the differences in age range or SES between migrants and non-migrants within this group. There is some indication that the UK population is less opento migration from non-White ethnic groups (Ford 2011), and so experiences ofdiscrimination may also be an important confounder for the relationship betweenmigration status, ethnicity and health outcomes. In another UK sample, it was suggestedthat non-migrants’ differential reaction to discriminatory experiences may account fordifferences in self-rated health (Smith et al. 2009). Unfortunately, we were not able toaddress this in the current analysis. Overall, the findings in this study reinforce evidencein the UK (Smith et al. 2009) and elsewhere (Kobayashi et al. 2008) that migration statushas differing effects on health across different ethnic groups.Ethnicity & Health 5894.2. Strengths and limitationsThis study is based on cross-sectional survey data and so we were unable to make causalinferences in assessing the relationship between migration status and health outcomes.This is also a local study of South-east London and although it highlights importantmethodological issues in investigating migration status, the findings of the study need tobe understood in the context of the sample area. It should also be noted that the non-response rates at the household level may have resulted in participation bias; thus, theprevalence estimates should be considered with caution. Moreover, we were only able tofocus on health outcomes within the host country and did not have detailed information toassess how the migration process, period of stay in other countries and pre-migrationperiod may have impacted health. At the same time, there are strengths to this study. Itcontains a diverse sample of migrants which is representative of the local populationaccording to ONS figures (Office for National Statistics 2013). By using interpreters, wewere able to include non-English speaking participants in the sample. Finally, the datacollected in this study allowed us to capture an extensive and detailed profile of healthbehaviours, physical and mental health symptoms, functional limitations and healthservice use.4.3. ImplicationsThe current study not only provides much needed quantitative data on the relationshipbetween migration status and health inequalities in the UK but also demonstrates theimportance of carefully considering how migration status is used methodologically as anexplanatory variable. This study raises further questions about the impact of other socialstatuses on migration status, such as gender. While beyond the scope of this current study,it may be important to capture the known differences in migrant experience by gender inreference to health. Migrant experience in a host country will likely be shaped by ascribedpositions based on multiple statuses and this may, in turn, impact how health inequalitiesdevelop and change over time. Migration status matters for understanding healthinequalities, but it is best understood in the context of how it intersects with other socialstatuses.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Biomedical Research Nucleus data management and informaticsfacility at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, which is funded by the NationalInstitute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre and Dementia Unit at SouthLondon and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London and a joint infrastructuregrant from Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity and the Maudsley Charity.FundingB.
