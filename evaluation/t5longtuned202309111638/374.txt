ABSTRACT: 
In view of the various novel quantitative ultrasonic evaluation techniques developed using Lamb wave propagation, the influence of an important related phenomenon, backward transmission, is investigated in this paper. Using the discrete layer theory and a multiple integral transform method, the surface displacement and velocity responses of isotropic plates and cross-ply laminated composite plates due to the Lamb waves excited by parabolic- and piston-type transmitting transducers are evaluated. Analytical expressions for the surface displacement and velocity frequency response functions are developed. Based on this a large volume of calculations is carried out. Through examining the characteristics of the surface displacement and velocity frequency response functions and, especially, the different propagation modes’ contributions to them, the influence of the backward wave transmission related to quantitative ultrasonicnondestructive evaluation applications is discussed and some important conclusions are drawn.

Consequently, a clear understanding of the characteristics of the wave propagation involved is very important for the interpretation of measurement results as well as for the further optimization of the corresponding measurement techniques. There has been a considerable amount of investigation on general characteristics of Lamb wave propagation, for example, Refs. 1–8. However, investigation of an important phenomenon related to the Lamb wave propagation, namely, backward wave transmission, is still limited. Based on the frequency equation for isotropic plates or cylinders, some researchers such as Tolstoy et al.9 first predicted the pres- ence of backward wave motion in which phase and group velocities have opposite signs. This means that energy is carried in a direction opposite to the motion of the waves. Several years later Meitzler10 reported his experimental ob- servations to give evidence of this interesting prediction and also gave an interpretation by comparing the displacement a!Electronic mail: e2kitip@brolga.uq.edu.au306 J.

After that, Torvik11 reconfirmed the presence of backward wave motion for a limited range of frequency during his investigation of the reflection of an infinite train of waves from the free edge of an isotropic plate. He also found that there exists a critical frequency in the second mode ~nonpropagating mode! well below the first cutoff frequency near which the wave reflec- tion coefficient experiences a sharp resonance in amplitude. Considering the abnormal properties discovered for backward wave transmission in isotropic plates, the influence of backward waves involved in some quantitative ultrasonic evaluation techniques such as acousto-ultrasonics or stress wave factor technique for composite laminates is considered in this paper. Using discrete layer theory and a multiple in- tegral transform method, the surface displacement and veloc- ity responses of isotropic plates and cross-ply composite laminated plates due to Lamb waves excited by contact-type transducers such as adhesively bonded piezoceramic trans- ducers are evaluated. Analytical expressions for the surface displacement and velocity frequency response functions are developed. Based on this, numerical calculations are carried out to examine the influence of backward wave transmission related to ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation applications. I. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM Consider a transmitting transducer attached to the upper surface of a composite laminated plate of thickness h as3060/107(1)/9/$17.00 © 2000 Acoustical Society of America content/terms.

A Cartesian coordinate system ~x,y,z! with origin on the upper surface of the laminate is introduced. Each lamina is modeled as a transversely isotropic material. For simplicity, we confine our attention to cross-ply laminates with the three axes coin- ciding with the axes of orthotropy and a plane strain condi- tion with the y axis being perpendicular to the plane. Then, in the absence of body forces, the basic governing equations for the ith lamina bounded by z5zi and z5zi11 are H sxxszz sxz J 5F c11 c13 0c13 c33 0 0 0 c55 G H exxezz gxz J , ~1! exx5 ]u ]x , ezz5 ]w ]z , gxz5 ]u ]z 1 ]w ]x , ~2! ]sxx ]x 1 ]sxz ]z 5r ]2u ]t2 , ~3a! ]sxz ]x 1 ]szz ]z 5r ]2w ]t2 , ~3b! szzuz5052p1~x ,t !, ~4a! sxzuz5052p2~x ,t !, ~4b! where s i j and e i j are stress and strain components, respec- tively; u and w denote displacement components in x and z axis directions, respectively; ci j and r are elements of the constitutive matrix and density of the ith lamina, respec- tively; t denotes the time variable; and p1(x ,t) and p2(x ,t) represent the distributed traction excited by the transmitting transducer. An approximate approach called the stiffness method12–14 or discrete layer method15 is used to solve the above equations. The essence of the method is to divide the plate into a number of mathematical layers in the thickness direction so that the variation of the displacements through the thickness of each layer can be approximated by various polynomials using interpolation for some unknown displace- ments. Using the principle of virtual work, the differential equations of the wave motion in the plate can then be ex- pressed in a form in which there is no differentiation with respect to the variable in the thickness direction. Following the procedure described in Refs. 12–15, it is assumed that the plate, as shown in Fig. 1, is divided into N mathematical layers. For the ith layer, the vector of displace- ments at an arbitrary point denoted by Ui(x ,z) 5@ui(x ,z),wi(x ,z)#T is expressed by a quadratic polynomial interpolation as FIG. 1.

In order to simplify the problem, as presented in Refs. 16 and 17 it is assumed that the pressure distribution be- tween the transducer and the plate can be approximated by a piston distribution or a parabolic distribution.

THE SOLUTION BASED ON SIMPLIFED THEORIES Although simplified plate theories such as the classical plate theory and the Mindlin plate theory cannot be used to examine backward wave transmission, they are still useful for result comparison or program check in low-frequency regions.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this section, based on the above analytical formula- tions, some numerical calculations are carried out to examine the characteristics of backward wave motion and its influ- ence on the surface displacement and velocity responses of the plate interrogated by the transmitting transducer. Two types of materials were used in the calculations. One is an isotropic aluminum, and the other is a glass/epoxy composite. Their engineering material constants are given in Table I. Also, in the calculation the input pulse used is the de- layed sine pulse with Haning window, i.e., pi~ t !5H 0.5@12cos ~2p f 0t/n0!#cos ~2p f 0t !, t<n0 / f 0 ,0, t.n0 /f0 , ~40! where f 0 is the central frequency and n0 is the number of periods. As a program check, the surface displacement response of a composite laminate ~0°/90°/0°! of thickness h52 mm due to parabolic source pulse is evaluated by both the dis- crete layer theory and the Mindlin plate theory. Figure 2 shows both results for low-frequency input ~the dominant frequency is 0.125 MHz!. It is seen that they are very close to each other. Using the same program the results for rela- tively high-frequency input ~the dominant frequency is 0.4 MHz! are evaluated by the two theories in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. For this frequency range the results of the two analysis models show some differences. It is evident that the above results are reasonable, considering the approximation involved in the Mindlin plate theory. This demonstrates, to some extent, the validity of the analysis and the computer program. Based on this, the backward wave motion charac- teristics and its influence are examined in the following para- graphs.

Since the wave number k and the fre- quency v have been normalized by V5vh/cs and g5kh , respectively, where cs5AG/r with G and r being the shear modulus and the mass density, the dispersion curves ob- tained are valid for a wide range of isotropic plate cases as long as the Possion’s ratio n50.3. In this figure, the back- ward wave branch is marked by B1B2 , in which the phase and group velocities are of opposite sign. It is necessary to point out that branch B1B2 here should be understood as its image with respect to the V axis, which has a positive group velocity. Additionally, for simplicity B1 and B2 are called the beginning and end points of the backward wave region in this paper, although B2 is usually called the cutoff frequency of the second symmetric real branch. Referring to Eq. ~28!, Fig. 6 shows the variation in am- plitude of the normalized displacement frequency response function G1(v) at two different surface points due to a nor- mal pressure pulse transmitted by a parabolic source. There are two singularities at the beginning and end points of the backward wave region, while at their two neighboring points A and C which are the first and second cutoff frequencies of antisymmetric modes there exist no singularities. This phe- nomenon is useful for understanding the peaks in the corre- sponding amplitude spectrum of a response signal when the input frequency covers this region. Additionally, it can also be seen that in relatively high-frequency cases, the displace- ment frequency response function has larger amplitude within and near the backward wave region. This means in such regions Lamb waves can carry more energy. However, FIG. 5.

Acoust. Soc. Am., Vol. 107, No. 1, January 2000 ibution subject to ASA license or copyright; see http://acousticalsociety.org/since there are several wave branches which have different group velocities, such regions will therefore cause more dis- persion or distortion of time domain signals if many wave modes are involved in measurements. Under the same condition as in Fig. 6, the displacement frequency response function G2(v) due to a shear force source is examined in Fig. 7. It is found that, ~1! at the beginning point of the backward wave region there still ex- ists a singularity, and near this singularity point G2(v) still has higher amplitude, while at the end point there is only a little discontinuity. ~2! At the points A and C which corre- spond to the cutoff frequencies of the second and third anti- symmetric real branches, there occur small discontinuities. ~3! Compared with G1(v), G2(v) is of smaller amplitude in the low-frequency region. In order to further understand the influence of backward wave transmission at the observation point farther away from the transmitting transducer, the contributions of different real branches ~i.e., the propagation modes! to the displacement frequency response function due to a normal pressure pulse transmitted by a parabolic source are shown in Fig. 8. The figure clearly shows that the backward wave branch causes two singularities at its beginning and end points and, com- pared with other branches in this frequency region it has apparently higher amplitude. This implies that the backward wave branch makes the major contribution to the peak area of the overall frequency spectrum when multiple wave modes are excited as shown in Fig. 6. In other words, the FIG. 7.

Download to IP: 130.102.158.19 On: Thu, 29 Oct 2015 01:46:57 Redistrpeak area of the overall spectrum is dominated by the back- ward wave mode. But, unfortunately, since the backward wave mode has much smaller wave number, i.e., much longer wave length ~see Fig. 5! than other branches in this region, the backward wave propagation will decrease the overall sensitivity for damage detection in this frequency re- gion. On the other hand, however, if the damage size con- cerned can be compared with the wave length of the back- ward wave or long distance wave interrogation is required, then the use of the single backward wave mode which can be achieved by interdigital transducers could probably have some advantages because it appears that the backward wave can be excited more efficiently. The contributions of different real branches to the dis- placement frequency response function G1(v) due to a nor- mal pressure pulse transmitted by a piston-type source have also been examined. Compared with Fig. 8, it is found that there is no apparent difference in the backward wave contri- bution between the parabolic and piston source cases. In consideration of the common use of the noncontact Doppler laser vibrometer system to measure surface velocity,20 in Fig. 9 the frequency response function of sur- face velocities H1(v) @see Eq. ~29!# due to a normal pressure pulse transmitted by a parabolic source is shown, and in Fig. 10 different real branches’ contributions to H1(v) for the point farther away from the source are illustrated.

Acoust. Soc.

So the above discussions about the backward transmission measured by surface displacement also applies to the cases for velocity measurement. However, it is of interest to note that H1(v) has relatively lower am- plitude than G1(v) in the low frequency region. Figure 11 shows the normalized dispersion curves of a glass/epoxy composite plate laminated as ~0°/90°/0°/90°/ 0°!s. In Fig. 12 its surface velocity frequency response func- tion due to normal pressure pulses transmitted by a parabolic-type transducer is presented. It can be seen that no matter whether the plate is isotropic or orthotropic, the be- havior caused by the backward wave transmission is similar. This is because the characteristics of the dispersion curves in both cases are similar. V. CONCLUSION In this paper, in recognition of the various quantitative ultrasonic evaluation techniques using Lamb waves propaga- tion, the influence of backward wave transmission in isotro- pic plates and cross-ply laminated composite plates has been investigated. Using the discrete layer theory, the surface dis- placement and velocity responses due to the Lamb waves excited by transmitting transducers have been evaluated. Ex- pressions of the surface displacement and velocity frequency response functions have been presented. For comparison, analytical results using the Mindlin plate theory have also been developed. Based on the analytical results numerical FIG. 11.

The following conclusions have been drawn: ~1! For a moderately thick plate or relatively high-frequency input pulses, there exists apparent backward wave trans- mission. It is essential to consider its influence in this frequency regime for the development of guided wave quantitative nondestructive evaluation techniques. ~2! At the beginning point of the backward wave region, the normal surface displacement and velocity frequency re- sponse functions have a singularity no matter whether the transducer transmits normal forces or shear forces, while at the end point a singularity occurs only for the case of a normal pressure source. This is important for the interpretation of peak points in the output frequency spectra. ~3! The backward wave branch carries much more energy than other branches in the backward wave frequency re- gime. This implies that the backward transmission, on one hand, will decrease the resolution of damage detec- tion if the ultrasonic techniques involve multiple wave modes and their input frequency cover this region since the corresponding wave lengths are large. On the other hand, however, it could be an advantage for some single- wave-mode related ultrasonic evaluation techniques. ~4! The surface displacement and velocity frequency re- sponse functions have the same behavior in the back- ward wave frequency region, e.g., relatively higher am- plitude, but in the low-frequency region, the former has relatively higher amplitude than the latter. ~5! The presented figures for the different real branches’ contributions to the surface displacement and velocity frequency response functions are of significance for se- lecting optimized input frequency regimes and the inter- pretation of the corresponding measurement results. ~6! It should be noted that in the analysis presented in this paper no damping was introduced, so the conclusions obtained above are only valid for structures with no or only small damping. For highly damped structural sys- tems, it is necessary to take into account the damping influence when similar investigations are carried out. APPENDIX ~1!
