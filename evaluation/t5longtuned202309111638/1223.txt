ABSTRACT: 
Elaborating first upon H. L. A. Hart\u27s distinction between imposing duties and imposing disabilities, this article explores the two senses mentioned (but not fully explained) by Hart in which power-holders may be legally disabled. Legal invalidation (nullification) of norms that have been generated by vulnerable power-holders is seen to reduce diversity or pluralism in every normative sphere, from the supranational to the intrafamilial. By contrast, mere legal nonvalidation (noncognizance) of such norms tends to preserve the autonomy of the power-holders that created the norms, thus enhancing legal pluralism. Punishment for creating forbidden norms amounts in principle to an in-between sort of control, less restrictive than completely invalidating them but more restrictive than just not validating them, that is, just ignoring them. Illustrative examples include the European Court of Justice\u27s early use of invalidation to convert an international treaty into a supranational constitution, and the subtle effects of legal nonvalidation of same-sex marriage.

I also add and di~cu ·s a further distinction. that between invalidated exercises of a power and 7WIZYalidated exercises of that power-something Hart ne,·er clear!) explains. The logic of nonvalidation actually turns out to benefit pluralism, as we sec below. I. HART'S DISTINCTIONS In his classic work, The Concept of Law,?. Hart initially contrasts criminal laws, which can be considered "coercive orders,"1 with "laws which give powers"5 (such as rules for making wi.lls,6 contracts and marriages,' or city ordinances11), the second t) pe of rule being, in I I art's view, facili tative rather than coercive. This is all well and good ,,ith regard to acts that Ma) within the limits of the conferred legal powers but not always with regard to act<; that exceed those limit<;. Hart misleads us when he goe on to suggest that there is always a "rddical difference in function"9 between the Ctiminallaw, which is "designed to suppress" conduct, and power-conferring nile , which "mer~lv withhold legal recoj.,rnition"10 from acts that are ultra \'ires: "nullity can not ... he assimilated to a punishment attached to a rule ac; an inducement to abstain from the activities which the rule forbids." 11 Hart fails here to mention that legal nullification or invalidation is capable of being used verv effectively to control those who possess the power to generate legal norms. CnrimLsly, in his later discussion of how the highest mle of recognition (or constitution) can limit legislative powers, Hart focuses precisely upon what he previously ignored : I\ const..itut..ion which dfccti'·ely restricts the legislative powers of the supreme lcgislamre in the ~>)'Stem docs nol do so by imposing (or at any rate ueed not tmpmc) duties on the le~,'islature nol lo attempt to legislate in certain ways; 3. ld. 4.

Punishment, Invalidation, and Nonvalidation 221 instead it pnl\idc that any such purportt'd legislation shall be \oid. It imposes not legal duties but legal disahilities.11 Invalidation serves here as a functional alternative to punishment, leading the Ie~-,rislatur<:> to sta} \\ithin its prcscriherl sph<:>re. The constitution makers have used null it' as a means of controlling the law makers. Disabilities are in fact a ''"irlelv eflective wav to resu i<.t the exercise of powers, even though I latt never applies this insight to the lower levels of those <:>mpowered to generate legal norms (e.g., contmct and city ordinance makers) that he discusses initially.

Since the state legislator.. are Iegalh disabled from passing statutes in violation of federal legal rules, such statutes would be declared invalid. But neither the legislators nor am citiLens who refu e to obc} the legislators would be pun ishcd.11 There appear to be many advantages-as well as ome disadvantages-to disabilities-cum-invalidation over duties-rum-punishment as a method of con- uolling persons (or institutions) ltke S that are mid-level norm generators. For one thing, im-dlidation would seem to be cheaper in that imprisonment is a\oided. Furthermore, etl<.'ttive im-alidation requires a more open and participatory societ} in which P know., of the right to refw;e S's order. Duucs are enforced top·dmm while disabilities arc made effective largcl} bottom- up. P mav also preferS to ha\c a disability (rather than a dut}) because a disabilitv provides P \\ith a secure ·immunitY~ (Hohfeld's term) against any S<ommanded duty to hike rather than just a freedom from such a duty, a freedom that is precarious berau e it is re\'O<..able at an} moment by S (despite an> dut) C has imposed on S). On the other hand, a dutv-ouly approach (\\ itltout anv imposed disabilit}. as in our fir<;t scenario) ma\ be better for cfftriency, sccreC), and other militarv values. We shall sec that the dutv-onl)' approach also has the advantage of securing legal independence or pluralism, as we later examine <l legal world far remo,·ed from militan precision. In the "dualist" conception, as we shall see, intemational law is a law that imposes only duties, not domestic disabilities, upon states. Howe,·er, rather than exploring all the ad\antages of imposing disabili- ties and / or duties, this essa)' focuses upon onlv one comparison. It seek.~ to understand whether punishment or im-alidation tends logicalh toward hrrcater domination of intermediate norm generator like S. At first sight, punishment may seem the harsher form of domination, because scemingl} the most painful. Indeed, ac; we see abo\'e, Hart denies that "nullity" ran e'en be considered a sanction, which of course is correct in the sense that it is ordinarily not a separable penal tv added to the criminal act. Furthermore, Hart often mini miLes any restrictive effects of disabilitics.15 And after all, 13.

Punishment, Invalidation, and Nonvalidation 223 the person solely under disabilities remains at liberty to behave as he wishes; his acL'>jul>l do not generate duties for olhers (or for himscll). Yet does having duties not leaveS with a 1-,rreater degree of norm-issuing freedom? If no disabilities arc imposed on him, S may still either create a duty for P (and maybe get punished) or else not create such a duty. S gets to choose. Increased certainty and severity of threatenerl punishment will, withoutanr doubt, yield greater empirical compliance by S. However, threats of future punishment can never amount to control in the absolute sense of the physical forcing of a person's body to do someone else's will or otherwise making disobedience impossible. Ewn in the face of the maximum possible threat--certain and eternal damnation-the one choosing whether to sin can claim .. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. "Hi Invalidation, by contrast, restricts norm generation <1bsolutely. If S is stripped of his power to create a duty for P, the creation of a rluty tor P becomes impossible for him. He is forced to conform to C's wishes. JTe can no longer choose to be an outlaw. This is a clear loss of freedom for S-and perhaps of dignit} as well, e\en if P docs not decide to act cockily and strut his new rights. Going back to religion ag-ain, when God told Arlam and Eve that they would be punished if they ate the forbidden fruit, they were still left with free will-with the choice to sin or not. Invalidation is the equivalent of God putting a force field around the tree, stopping them absolutely from eating its fruit. The force field would have wholly deprived them of freedom to pick the fruit and of any dignity that comes with that freedom. In terms ofliberty, it is less restrictive to have one's hands slapped 1han to ha,·e them tied. ~1oreo,cr, as a conceptual matter, punishment in itself (without invalida- tion) result'> in greater legal pluralism-more independent legal systems or ,pheres-than docs invalidation in it<ielf (withom punishment). Where C ,ubjects S only to duties (even backed by certain and severe punishments), one need look only to S in order to know P's duties. There may be two <.t"parate legal spheres quite independent of each othet, one centered on (.and the other on S. By contra<;t, if C uses disabilities to controlS, Swill ha\'e a reduced sphere within which S can shape the law for P. ln order to know P's duties, one must now refer to the acts of C as well a<; to the (ommands of S, for some of the latter may have been invalidated by the former. For C to convert his orders from duties to disabilities would thus be ro abrogate much of S's ability to create an autonomous legal sphere. The pluralism left intact by C not imposing disabilities on S should be favorerl tr. the military because instant obedience by Pis an important good and P n more quickly and easily discover his duties if he need not look beyond t' commands of S. lh William Emest Henley, lnvrctus, in MoDER.'!

Precisely insofar as international Ia\\ can impo e only duties, it can ne\'er in any wav affect the Btitish Parliament's monopoly of domes- tic lawmaking power. Under a dualist regime, international treaties haYe no domestic e!Tect unless and until they are implemented by the national lcgislantre. 13} contrast, a .. monist" approach to international law allows in- ternational norms to supplement and even to invalidate national ones, thns creating a single legal universe with concomitalll loss of national sovereignty. Since some of us may not have much sympathy for sergeants, let us leave our simple C-S-P model and look further at the analogous way · in which invalidation can diminish political independence among nations. The legal history of the European Community offers us a powe1 ful example of how the shift from duties to disabilities changed independent nations into subparts of a new legal entity. Such a seismic shift is by no means unthinkable in other regional economic associations as well and e\'en on a world scale through organit.ations such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organintion. From its inception, the European Community treat) contained legal du- ties imposed on its members as well as \'arious enforcement mechanisms a~-,rainsr \'iolaLOrs of those dutics. 17 The fact that these enforcement mecha- nisms were original!} emisioned by the signatories of the treaty shows clearly that the signawries assumed that member states might violate rhe treaties, that is, that violation was possible. However, in 1963 and 1961, in the ~'t.zn Cend m toos and Co.~ta cases, 18 the European Court of justice took it upon itself to convert certain of those duties inLO disabilities, making violation of the treaties impos:.ible. The specific duty invol\'cd in the \fan Gend Pn Loos case was the duty not to raise tariff.<; on imports from other member states. The Court found that by reclassifYing a certain good, the Netherlands in cncct had increased its import tariff on that good. :-.Jo problem so far. According to the treaties, I he Netherlands was thus su~ject to being prosecuted for its treaty violation. But the Court decided that the rule against raising tariffs would be more "effective" if raising tarif!:S were converted from something prohibited 10 something impossible. The Court declared the increase in tariff to be simpll invalid; the importer was told, in effect, that he need not comply \\ith Dutch law, or rather, that the Dutch law in question did not really exisL The Netherlands did not have to be condemned as a lawbreaker becau~ it was disabled from breaking the law no matter how hard it tried (and so 17.

Ordinal) legal reasoning would have held that if there were a contlict ·een an earlier domestic constimtional nonn and a later imernationaJ ary norm, the treat) norm would be the one that would be invalid under me~tic law, although (according to dualist reasoning) the nation in ques- ~n might still be su~ject to condemnation and possibly a penalty under ternationallaw. One might pause here to note an outstanding feat ofjudicial activism: the luropean Court ofjustice created a new polity by changing an international tn-aty into a const.itution.~0 But let us keep our attention fixed on the etherlands. European Community law penetrated and took possession of Dutch law, making Dutch dissenters (here, those who objected to paying the lil.x) the agents of Europe. From that point on, European norms would be directly applicable and supreme in Dutch courts and in all other domestic mstin1tions, and the European Court would defend the rights of Dutch mdividuals against the Dutch people. lJnder this new legal rchrimc, the European Community became able to dominate the etherlands far more "effectively" (ac; the European Court aptly recognized) than it could have done by means of mere duties. \J\'hethcr this is good or bad depends to a great extent on how much we care about Dutch political and cultural unity and independence, on the one hand, and the individual freedoms of Dutch traders, on the other. We can, however, make some generalizations. It is no doubt true that the person on the ground, the individual citizen, has more freedom from rluties under a system in which intermediate authorities are limited by invalidation, as compared to one in which they are limited only by punishmeut. Invali- dation inherently fa,ors individual liberty to hdzaveas one wishes insofar as it reduces the total number of duties with which individuals have to comply b' invalidating some of them, cutling down on the dutv-generating power of some of their political superiors. It is tautologically true that limiting government is good for Iibert} from go,·ernment. At the same time, invalidation sharply curtails group and even individual autonomy, for to be auto-nomoLLS (self-lawgiving) would seem to include pre- cisely the ability to create duties for oneself. If only the threat of punishment is imposed on a group, it can still decide to resist its overlord ac; long as it is willing to chance suffering the prescribed sanction. If the duties the group 19.

Moreover, a degree of indi\id- ual freedom has been lost as well: the freedom to effectuate legal change through the legal process. A Dutch voter can no longer aim to reclassify imports in a way that raises any tariffs, if such acl'i arc legal nullities. Individual autonomy (binding oneself by a mle) can suffer still more seriously from invalidation. Consider the power to contract, a form of pri- vate lawmaking. Even if contracts were punished, as long as they remained valid, the choice to create legal duties for oneself would remain open. For example, if contracl..'. to pay gambling debts were no longer invalid (as they usually are now) but were instead merely punishable, individuals could still bind themselves by law to pay such debts. (Of course, if the punishment were severe and certain, they would be unlikely to exercise this lawmaking free- dom.) Again, where marrying without a license (e.g., so-called "common- law" marriage) is illicit but still valid (e.g., in the law of equity), perhaps even punished but not nullified, indi\iduals retain more ability to marry unofficially than they would if an unlicensed marriage were wholly invalid. Likewise for bigamy: if a second marriage were possible but punishable, the ability to have multiple spouses would be far greater than it is now, ec- ond marriages being null. Similarly, if same-sex marriages somehow were prohibited and punished (even by a term in jail) but remained valid once illegally begun, gays and lesbians would ob\iously ha,·e much more power to bind themsch·es in marriage than under today's regimes in which their marriages are an absolute nullity.21 I conclude that invalidation is an enormously powerful tool of domina- Lion, more powerful than punishment alone as a means to limit the auton- omy of groups and even of indhiduals. Insofar as we may wish to preserve pluralism in law and legal culture, we must be careful to di-;tinguish inval- idation from punishment and to use the former with caution as we build new leg-al orders in the world. Ill. NONVALIDATION Anyone familiar with Hart's initial discussion of legal powers and their limits will find it hard to imagine that he and 1 are describing the same legal phenomenon. As we see briefly aboYe, Hart at first depicts legal pow- ers as wholly beneficent, as simply intended to facilitate decentralized law- making. So he says that the purpose of requiring two witnesses for a will's validity or reciprocal consideration for contractual validity is just to give people easy-to-follow recipes for making rules that the government will en- force. Moreover, the disabilities implied here (no legal validity without two 2l. Of cour~e. whc1e invalidation and punishment are combiut>d, iudi~idual~ are ma.'l.i- mally limited.

Hart is indeed correct that his early examples do not have the supprcs- e aims or consequences discussed above in the hypothetical example CJI the military superior and the actual example of the European Com- munity. It would be very strange to see the rules for wills or contracts as draconian means of making testation-without-two-witnesses and promises- "ithout-reciprocity impossible. No one seeks to put an end to deathbed rrquests and extralegal promises. The law doe~ not validate such informal iikl~ but it has nothing ag-ainst their ha ... ing social force. Yet, as Hart later discusses, when a constitution imposes limits on legislative power, such as a rule against raising import taxes, its purpose is to make such ultnt vires ans ineffective, to deprive them of all social force, just as C's disabling of S was meant to stop P from ha ... ing to go out on a hike. The nature of this difference, I maintain, can be grasped by understanding the first discussion in Hart's classic work to deal \vith nomttlidation and the second to deal with irl\ttlidation. 112 Invalidation occurs when one normative order declares the rules of an- other order to be no longer internally binding, to be nullities within that other order. Nonvalidation occurs when a normative order refuses within itself to recognize and efTectuate the rules of another order but docs not in- terfere with continued recognition and effectiveness of those nonns within that other order. Thus, for example, invalidation occurs when C declares that S has no power over P, perhaps even impl)ing that P can come to C for a remedy if S nc\ertheless should attempt to use illicit force ag-ainst P. Nomr<Liidation of S's order would mean only that C \viii not treat P's refusal to hike as an offense against C. Again, invalidation occurs when the European Court tells participants in the Dutch legal order that tariff increases are no longer to be treated by them as valid >vithin the Netherlands. Nonvalidation would mean only that Dutch domestic tariff reclassifications do not count as valid accommodations of the .:-.:etherlands's international treaty obligations.

The clislinclion in this essay between nomalidation and irwalidation overlaps to some dcgre<."with that between ·,oid" and ",·oiclable" or"null" and "nullifiable" acLs and like distin~ttons. \'oicl atts are simpl) ignored by thf' law (e.g., a "marriage" of two six-year-<>lds or "legislatton" bv a Ia\\ faculty establishing a nation a.! religion) because they arc wholly null. \'otdable acts are one~ that originally have some leg-al existence thar the law may undertake to nullifv (e .g., a marriage caused by fraud in some essential re.pect or legislation by Congrc~ establishing a religion). fhe fomtca rna) be, surpri~ingl), more fa,·orable to pluralism than lhe latter, as we see he low. 228 RICHARD STITH state aim to interfere radically with the autonomy of the moral ordet;ngs formed by such nonlegal vows. Par.tdoxicall), then, although the difference between invalidation and nomalidation may seem but a nuance, it matters greatly. \Vhile invalidation is bv ib definition more effective than punishment in stopping intermediate norm generation, nonvalidation i more benign thaJt punishment in letting such norm generation continue. Invalidation of matrimonial promi es rc.:- stricts them more ahsolutcl} than docs even se\ere punishment for making such promises, hut e\cn a mild punishment would be more inhibiting than mere nonvalidation of such promises (i.e., simply ignoring them) would be. This conceptual distinction between invalidation and nom"<~.lidation ma} stand out still more clearly if we re\erse for a moment the order of morality and legality, illuminating two differing \\a}-s in which moralit\ ma} pass judgment on law. We discnss above how law may fail to validate moral nonns legal I) without thcreh} aiming to invalidate them morally. A'i a posithist, I lan rnal...cs a similar point with regard to moral invalidation of law. A1-,rainst the radical claim that "an unjust law is not a Ia\\," that is, that an uqjust, immoral law is legally invalid, Hart asserts that a properly enacted law remains such even if it is nonbinding in a moral o;ense. For Hart, a legal rule cannot he invalidated by moralit}, though it rna} well be nonvalid in terms of moral obligation. Hart makes this distinction in important part for the sal...c of p luralist thought, seeking to preserve a conceptual separation between law and morality \\ithout disparaging the role of either.23 Here is a succinct example illustrating the inner logic of the po<>sibilitic~ we are dio;cw;sing in oi-der of increasingly greater restriction on internH.'"- diate nonn generation: validation, nonvalidation, punishment, and finally invalidation. Suppose that two parents are having trouble getting their child to go to bed by 9 P.M. They might wish f(>t· the state to validatt' the 9 1'.1\t. duty they have imposed on their child in order to gi\e that duty greater authori!\. But if state law refuses to back the parents up officially, this nont~alidation (the mere absence of official recognition) causes them no loss. The filial duty to obe} remains intact as a matter of mor<~.lity, religion, custom, and the like. By contrast, the tate could declare that making a child go to bed so carl} is child abuse and could forbid the parents to impose a 9 1'.1\t. bedtime, backing up thi'i state-imposed parental duty with a threat to punish them if they continue to tell their child to go to bed by 9 p.m. Yet at the mnc time, state law might still say and do nothing regarding the moral, religious, and other nonns that would support am 9 P.~t. duty upon which the parents migh t defiantly insist. The filial duty to go to bed could thus remain intact, albeit nomolidated (and e\cn punished) as a matter of state law. 2~. /d. at 207-212.

A FURTHER CONDITION FOR NONVALIDATION The \cry possibilit\- of nonvalidation (rather than im~aJidation) of an act depends on the act in question having some force or purpose independent of the achievement oflcgal validity in the normathe order that is gran ting or deming '>Uch validit). lf ''e look back to Hart's nonreprcssive sor~ of disabilities, such as the di ability to make legally enforceable contrac~ in the absence of re- ciprocal consideration, we can see that the power-holders iu qnec;tion ha\e no desire to have their nonvalidated infonnal acts become legally validated. :-.Jo one is demanding that the set of "tontracts \\ithout con- ,ideralion" or the c;et of "wills with only one wiUlc'>l> ~ become valid (as t~pposed to arguing that particular acll> do not fall ''ithin these sets).24 :\orwalidation is an option because eVCI)'One i!, satisfied to have the Ia\\ rgnore '>UCh informal norm creation. Consider, bv con~dSt, the foJJo,,ing report: in 2007, the .\'l'w York Tzmrs r.tn a story about parents who had organi1ed to obtain birth tertificates for their ~tillhorn children. The\ wanted the state to certifY that their children had once existed. "It's about dij:.,rn ity and validity. lr'o; the same rca.-.on why we want things like marriage licensee;," declared a leader.2'' Insofar as par- ents come to depend upon state validation for the Yery existence o f theit 1 hildrcn and marriages, they gi\'e nonvalidalion the same etlt:ct over their lr\TS a-. invalidation would ha\'e. Furthermore, b~ insisting upon validation, they tempt the state to extend its power. It would require great self~rel>tr.tint .md a kind of paternalism on the pan of the state fo• it to resist this otler nf overlordship--for the state to tl)' to encourage these patent'> to seek tl1e .,,urance the} net'd from nonstate sources. After all, if lhe state does noth- mg, it will be blamed for the nonexistence of kev family goods, c;o (unless rt would inwr large costs in doing so) it might ac; well get into the husine l> or deciding which children and marriages deserve legal recognition. ln at kast a de facto sense, lhe option of nonvalidation no longer C'xic;ts, because the parcntc; have abdicated their extralegal autonomy. 24. nw n·ason lor thi~ apathv is ob\touslr that minimally adt:4L1..1le reciprocal consideration nd a second \\illlt""-~ amount to \irtually cos tiel<> lonnalities, so lhat k" tf any l'arl" about ha\'ing , lit within thcit :.trit hur' :2.'•.

First, the 1.uperior order must impose a disability only as to ill> own legal order; it must not neg-t1te the informal norms (or nonns operative in a separate leg-al sphere) supporting the prac- tice in question, such as the practice of informal promising or raising impo11 ta"cs; it mtL'it not reach down to destroy an othenvise autonomous nonna- tive order. Second, that latter order must have internal strength; it tnu5t not come to depend for its imcmal validity on higher-level recognition or even on the absence of higher-level invalidation. Informal promi ing can- not remain full) autonomous if onl} noninvalidated promising comes to be felt binding, nor can Dutch law remain autonomous if it refuses to enforce an) laws that have been rejected in the international realm. A nation whose own constitution i entirely monist \\ith rebrard to international law depend~ for ill> independence upon the pleasure of the m.tke• and interpreters of international law. Indeed, if a lower-lc\el nonnative community has 'iufficient c;trength, it may e'en be able to counter a higher legal authority's allt:mpll> to imalidatc its norms. l .ower-lcvel actors may continue to abide by officiall) invalidated n01rns, that is, the)' mav treat those nom1s as merely nonvalidated. Thus even common-law maniages and gambling debts that are wholly imalid according to state law may in fact retain significant force fm the parties engaged in them. Like\\<ise, a powerful country (e.g., the United States) may simply ihrnore the findings of some international legal tribunal that certain domestic norms lack \alidicy• (e.g., certain pmcedures for imposing the death penalt}') . ln the same wa), a fiercely ftlial child could treat an officially inv-alid bedtime rule as rnerclv nomalid and insi ton obsenring it. Indifference to official invalidation can tum it practicallv inLO nonvalida- tion.

Punishment, Invalidation, and Nonvalidation 231 and groups refraining from seeking higher recognition or enforcement of their internal norms. It could be unfortunate for humanity if each and t>very human norm were subject to state validalion, even if most were to be granted legal validity. We might not \vish every promise, every private family and fdendship event or duty, to be registered and overseen even by .1 benevolent State. In like manner, we might not wish every national law to be subject to the approval of even the most well-intentioned international or supranational legal regime. V. THE EXAMPLE OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE -\ useful illustration of the ambiguous benefh of state validation and yet the complexity of resistance can be seen in the topic of same-sex marriage. Deparling from its draconian treatment of bigamy (and, historically, misce- ~enation), current American Jaw nowhere "prohibit-;" extralegal same-sex marriage in the sense of punishing it; people of the same sex have full bchaviontl Iibert} to engage in wedding ceremonies, to bind themselves rnorall} and even by leg-al contract regarding property and the like, and to live together thereafter.27 But, except in Massachusetts2R and California,2v .\merican law docs not validate such marriages qua marriages. By and large, the law just ignores them-leaves them alone. The current debate over same-<;ex marriage may mrn precisely on the distinclion between invalidation and nonvalidation. Some may view the , urrent absence of validation of same-sex marriage as a relatively tolerant ,ystern of nonvalidation, one that leaves gay and lesbian cultural norms intact and unregulated. Others may view the current legal regime as closer to relatively hostile invalidation, which declares such unions to be without practical effect. Perhaps the status of same-sex bonds depends upon rhe purpose of mar- riage for the gay and lesbian community or upon the purpose of each mdh idual same-sex marriage for those entering into it. If the point of ... "lme-sex marriage is to gain the tax and retirement benefits hitherto open only to heterosexuals or to obtain a supposed moral imptimatur from the l.lw, refusal of legal recognilion amounts in effect to invalidation, whatever 11s intent ma} be. In order to obtain these goods, validation would have to be sought, even at the price of regulation (e.g., application of bigamy tnd divorce law). By contrc:tSt, if those entering such a marriage were con- tt•nt to bind themselves bra mutual promise of lifelong fide lity or content to secure nonlegal forms of moral recognition by the community, legal '1.7.

Failure to pcrcehe the difference between invalidation and nonvalidation may lead lesbian and gay communiLies to think that state validation is a prerequisite to all normative stature, not reali7ing that nonvalidation could actually be a means to protect the moral and social autonom} of same-sex unions. By comparing onlv invalidation and validation, the} rna} fail to consider nomr.alidation as a possible way to achieve normative stature while avoiding state intrusion into private life. VI. CONCLUSION Invalidation of duties that have been generated by \1.llncrablc normaLive orders can reduce di\etsity or pluralism in evcrv sphere, from the suprana- Lional to the inrrafamilial. In contra.'it, nonvalidation of those same duties may preserve the autonomy of the normative spheres in which the duLies atise. Punishment for creati ng forbidden duties amounts in principle to an in-between sort of control, less restrictive than completely nullifying the duties but mo re restrictive than just ignoring their existence. Once properly clarified , Hart's work helps us understand these fundamental distinctions.
