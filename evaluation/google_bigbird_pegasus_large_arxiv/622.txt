ABSTRACT: 
In both World Wars, the state retained men with essential skills on the home front. Despite needing to mobilise industry and labour in order to supply the military and to maintain key services such as healthcare and food provision, those men who remained in civilian roles were susceptible to accusations of cowardice and being derided as shirkers evading their patriotic duty. While the manliness of the ‘soldier hero’ was secure, the civilian man was susceptible to having his masculinity called into question. This article utilises a range of sources including parliamentary debates, cartoons, Mass Observation records, written testimony and oral histories to examine the policies that were implemented affecting civilian male workers deployed in essential jobs in both wars and the perceptions of men to their reserved status. While there were haphazard attempts to raise an ‘industrial army’ in the First World War, by 1939, a more systematic approach had been implemented with a Schedule of Reserved Occupations drawn up retaining key men in their work. While men on the Second World War home front were potentially diminished by the ‘soldier hero’ and the female war worker, they defined and defended their contributions to the national war effort in written and oral sources in gendered terms, making reference to job security, valued skills, significant earning power, the auxiliary position of female dilutees, positive cultural representations and the added dangers from aerial bombing.

Volunteering was met with huge ‘social approbation’, evident in the filmfootage depicting cheering crowds that gathered to see the volunteers march off to war.2The manly heroism of those who had served, whether as volunteers or as conscripts, wascemented immediately following the war by the state-orchestrated rituals surroundingthe Cenotaph in 1919 and the burial of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey in1920, as well as by the construction of about 40,000 local memorials.3 The naming ofthe military dead on these monuments facilitated the ordinary soldier to emerge as a heroin the dramatic narrative of war, which had prior to the Boer War been the prerogativeof military leaders.4 Such memorials kept alive the ‘soldier hero’. This was bolsteredby the deluge of combatant memoirs, plays and poetry collections that were publishedchronicling the horrors of trench warfare. In the Second World War conscription wasimplemented immediately, thereby erasing the unique status of the volunteer, and itwas the pilot of the Royal Air Force (RAF) who occupied the position at the pinnacle ofthe hierarchy of wartime roles. The transformation of warfare between 1918 and 1940,during which time air power had become instrumental, shaped conceptualisations ofwhat constituted ideal masculinity. The ordinary ‘Tommy’ of the First World War hadbeen replaced by the more socially elite ‘fly boys’ in the Second World War as thosewho embodied manly heroism; ‘the few’ to whom ‘so many’ owed so much. Central tothe allure of the RAF was the distinctive Air Force blue uniform.5 In both wars, militaryuniform marked out the wearer as a member of one of the armed forces participatingactively in the war effort and signified the successful enactment of what R. W. Connellcalls ‘hegemonic masculinity’, that which is culturally exalted albeit never numericallydominant.6 To be manly in wartime was, then, to be a combatant.Such forms of maleness were positioned above other subordinated masculinities,such as the man who remained on the home front.

As Lois Bibbings has notedin relation to the First World War, ‘all men who were not in the military were, tovarying degrees, excluded from exemplary notions of maleness’.7 While the 16,500men (approximately) who applied for exemption on the grounds of conscience were‘particularly marginalised’ because they were ‘the antithesis of the iconic figure ofthe soldier’, all men not in uniform were susceptible to having their masculinitycalled into question.8 One First World War recruitment poster questioned ‘Are youa Man or are you a Mouse? . . . a rotter and a coward’.9 Non-uniformed men wereexcluded from popular notions of ideal manliness and risked being seen as ‘non-men’.Rendered unmanly by their failure to ‘prove’ their masculinity through volunteering,civilian men in the First World War were relegated to a subordinate status, suspectedof cowardliness, ‘shirking’, a term that was in use by 29 August 1914 and whichentered the Oxford English Dictionary later that year, and ‘slacking’, an expression incirculation by September 1914.10 There were no monuments erected in the inter-warperiod to civilian men who maintained services on the home front or provided themeans by which combatants could fight, and there was a dearth of civilian accounts.11Their war stories were simply not regarded, either by themselves or by publishers,as sufficiently marketable. In the Second World War, there was much less culturaldisapprobation of civilian men as we shall see but there remained concerns about‘scrimjacks’ ‘hiding’ in ‘soft jobs’ in order to evade conscription and ‘scrimshank’their way out of their patriotic duty.By failing to fulfil their side of the wartime gender contract by donning uniformand serving in the armed forces, these civilian ‘non-men’ are rendered invisible. Thusthe home front is regarded in both wars as a largely female space in which womendonned overalls and uniforms to replace the men who had left en masse to join thearmed forces; the presence of young men in British towns, cities and the countrysidewas rarely acknowledged, either at the time or subsequently. Reverend Dr AndrewClark, for example, wrote a letter in 1918 stating that his Essex parish of Great Leighswas ‘absolutely empty of young men’, while Janet Miller, a trainee teacher during theSecond World War, recalled in an interview in 2008 that ‘There were no men. The menwere all in the forces’.12 However, contrary to popular perception, neither wartimehome front was denuded of men; 53.8 per cent of English and Welsh males agedbetween fifteen and forty-nine did not serve in the forces in the First World War.13 Thiswas even starker prior to the passing of the conscription act, given that three-quartersof men aged fifteen to forty-nine did not volunteer. Remaining a civilian was not aminority male experience in the First World War. Nor was it in the Second. The ratio ofmen in industry to men in the forces was 6:1 in June 1940, 3:1 in 1941–42 and 2:1 bymid-1943 for the remainder of the war.14 Thus, far more men remained at home thanwere conscripted into the three armed forces. The home front was, then, not devoid ofmen.The retention of large numbers of men in employment was a consequence of thehighly industrialised warfare of the first half of the twentieth century. Britain, as withall belligerent nations, needed to carefully balance requirements for civilian manpowerand military personnel. This equilibrium was achieved by directing essential labour andwhile all combatant nations became increasingly reliant on female workers, male labourwas also subject to varying levels of control. Millions of men in both wars who werein good health and aged within the call-up range were prevented to varying degrees by© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:48123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748British Civilian Masculinity and Reserved Occupations, 1914–45 3the state from joining the forces and remained in their civilian occupations which wereQ2considered essential to the war effort. By the Second World War, Britain learnt fromthe mistakes made during the First when large-scale uncontrolled volunteering intothe army in the charged atmosphere of the early months resulted in the loss of skilledmen from mines, munitions industries and other essential trades, all occupations vitalto the prosecution of the hostilities. It recognised that to fight a protracted campaign,it needed not only soldiers to fight but also civilians to equip them and to maintainrudimentary services on the home front.This article examines policies directed to, and perceptions of, British civilian mendeployed in essential jobs in both wars. It foregrounds the male worker in the SecondWorld War, but makes reference to the wider context of the First World War whichwas so crucial to lessons learnt. Despite being central to participation and, arguably,victory in both wars, the figure of the British civilian male worker has been forgotten,overshadowed by the prevailing assumption that the men who remained behind wereeither effeminate cowards who had proffered a conscientious objection to fighting,unpatriotic shirkers who were avoiding military service, physically unfit men who hadfailed a medical examination or older men who were above the age of conscription. Thecivilian man also remains largely absent within academic research. Notable exceptionsare Laura Ugolini’s work on middle-aged middle-class Englishmen during the FirstWorld War and Penny Summerfield and Corinna Peniston-Bird’s research on the HomeGuard in the Second World War.15 My forthcoming book Men in Reserve, co-writtenwith Arthur McIvor and Linsey Robb on working-class men in reserved occupationsin the Second World War, seeks to address this lacuna.16This article utilises parliamentary debates, cartoons, Mass Observation reports,written testimony and oral histories. Interviews were conducted with fifty-six menaged between eighty-six and ninety-six.17 The number of men still alive whoseventy years ago were engaged in reserved occupations is small and thus the samplewas inevitably skewed towards the youngest workers. The vast majority had worked inmanual industrial trades as toolmakers, engineers and workers in factories, shipyardsand railways. The class profile of the interviewees was thus predominately workingclass. A relatively wide geographical spread was achieved with two men based in Walesduring the war, twenty in Scotland including key industrial centres like Glasgow, portssuch as Ardrossan as well as more rural areas including Lochgilphead; and thirty-fourin England including cities such as Newcastle, Birmingham and Canterbury, port townssuch as Portsmouth and more rural places such as Carlisle, Farnborough and Exeter.Regional identities were key to the ways men configured their masculinities. In areassuch as Merseyside, Tyneside, Clydeside and South Wales, which were dominated byheavy industries such as shipbuilding, iron and steel and coal mining, a culture ofmasculinity circulated that was predicated on hard, dangerous work.18The ‘badged’ and ‘starred’ men of the First World WarAs war was looking increasingly likely in the late 1930s, the British government soughtto organise its manpower resources, balancing the needs of industry against that of theforces. It acknowledged that mistakes were made during the First World War whenthe army expanded at such a rate that it could not be supplied and too great a strainwas placed on essential industry as men in occupations vital to the prosecution of the© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:481234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484 Gender & Historyhostilities were permitted to volunteer. In just two days in early 1915 30,000 minersfrom Rhondda in south Wales enlisted. They had to be recalled from the trenches inlate 1915 and brought back to produce coal.19 Men were also returned from the frontto resume roles in other key industries such as agriculture and munitions. The statewas mindful of the consequences of unrestricted mass enlistment, as Ernest Brown,the Minister of Labour, acknowledged in December 1938:One of the clearest lessons of the Great War of 1914–18 was the necessity for conserving the supplyof skilled workmen employed in war industries. During the earlier part of the War great damagewas done by the indiscriminate recruitment of men who would have been invaluable in making warmaterial and in maintaining essential services. Indeed, efforts were made to recover men from theArmy.20The government in the late 1930s based many of their manpower decisions on thelessons learnt between 1914 and 1918 including the compilation of lists of occupationsthat were deemed essential to the war effort.Changing policies illustrate the state’s gradual recognition during the First WorldWar of the importance of skilled workers in key industries. During the period ofuncontrolled mass volunteering, the Admiralty sought to acknowledge the contributionsof male workers who were manufacturing munitions for the Navy by issuing war servicebadges and certificates which attested to their importance to the war effort. Withinsix months, 400,000 had been handed out. Similarly, the War Office distributed 80,000‘On War Service’ badges to men working in key armaments firms and in OrdnanceFactories (where small arms, ammunition and explosives, crucial for supplying theBritish army were manufactured).21 From July 1915, the newly established Ministryof Munitions became the sole badging agency. In a context whereby encouragement toenlist was strident, such badges might have defended civilian men against accusationsof cowardice and shirking. Yet there were many jobs where the system of badging wasnot in operation, such as coal mining, and the manpower of these essential industriesas we have seen, was being depleted by skilled men’s volunteering.However, many men wished to remain in their civilian jobs. Andrew Clarkrecorded in his diary in May 1915 the ‘indignation’ and ‘resentment’ that local farmlabourers felt at ‘being badgered to enlist’ by women ‘pestering them’ and noted thatall recruitment posters had been torn down in his village.22 Clark also noted that ‘hun-dreds of strong bodied young men’ had sought jobs in a local munitions firm to avoidenlisting.23To ensure key workers remained on the home front while others were releasedinto the forces, the National Registration Act was passed in July 1915. It sought toascertain how many men aged fifteen to sixty-five were employed in each trade. All menwhose age fell within this range who were not in the forces were required to register,providing details of their employment. As Keith Grieves notes, the register was intendedto provide reliable information in order to open up a dialogue about the distribution ofmanpower.24 It became embroiled, however, as Rosemary Elliott argues, ‘with debatesabout voluntary recruitment and conscription’.25 Labour exchanges starred the papersof young men who were engaged in essential industries. Of the almost five millionmen of conscription age not in the services, over 1.5 million were in ‘badged’ and‘starred’ jobs. An inventory began to be compiled in October 1915, listing all rolesconsidered vital to the war economy, such as farm worker, coal miner, shipbuilder and© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:48123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748British Civilian Masculinity and Reserved Occupations, 1914–45 5factory worker. Men employed in these trades were regarded as being in a ‘reservedoccupation’.To try to avoid the need for compulsion, the Group (or Derby) Scheme wasimplemented in October 1915 by permitting men aged nineteen to forty, in starredand unstarred occupations, to declare their intent for future military service. Between16 October and 11 December 1915, nearly three million men responded, attesting forforthcoming service. Many were in badged, starred or reserved occupations, whichwere renamed ‘certified occupations’. The four-inch wide armband that was issued tomen who had attested made visible their willingness to serve, while the dark khakicloth aligned them with the volunteer soldier. Those who attested were released backto civilian life until their call up, which would be done according to age and mar-ital status. The first groups called up in December 1915 affected single men agedbetween nineteen and twenty-two. The public were assured that married men wouldonly be called up once all available single men had gone into the forces. ReginaldGibbs, a thirty-six-year-old science teacher in Hampshire, recorded in late October hisreceipt of Lord Derby’s letter, which he pasted into his diary, and his intention not toattest:I certainly do not intend to offer myself as a recruit for the following reasons: (i) I fear intenselydeath and mutilation such as is likely to befall soldiers in the fighting line. (ii) . . . [T]his call is notbeing made to defend England, but to defend the Empire in other words to keep our heels in thenecks of conquered peoples. (iii) I have six children, whom I wish to keep in bread and margarineand boots.He also noted the 100,000 ‘fallen heroes of Gallipoli’ and remarked that ‘Lord Derby[? – word made illegible by a mark] politely asks me to help make up the “wastage”.Thank-you my lord. Under these circumstances I prefer to be a live coward to a deadhero’.26 The distinction between the cowardly civilian and the ‘soldier hero’ was sodeeply engrained that even men not in uniform used such potent language.With the passing of the Military Service Act in January 1916 ending the voluntarysystem of recruitment, the provision of manpower became the responsibility of thebureaucratic state. Single men and widowers without dependent children, who wereaged eighteen to forty-one, were liable to be called up for service. Andrew Clarkrecorded in his diary in March 1916 that ‘horseman’ Albert Wright ‘is a starred man,in a privileged occupation. He married a week ago and is now reported to be gloryingover the unmarried labourers that every one of them will have to go before he is calledout’.27 However, the policy was extended in April to include married men who hadattested, which met with an outcry as there were still single men who were yet to besummoned. One wife whose husband was called up was reported as thinking it ‘unjustthat unmarried men should be left at munitions work while skilled workmen, married,are sent straight into the army’.28 Large numbers of starred men employed in particulartrades vital to the war effort, who were now issued with a certificate of exemptionrather than a badge, were initially prevented from being called up. Unmarried menwho were below the age listed in the column next to the job on the inventory ofreserved occupations were liable for military service; those above the age were exemptfrom call up. A ‘blacksmith’ for example became exempt at twenty-five, a ‘foreman’employed in the mining and textiles industries at thirty, while married men had differentages of exemption in some occupations so as to limit their call up.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:481234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647486 Gender & HistoryFigure 1: Percy Fearon (Poy), ‘Sketch Map ofthe Funk Holes of London’, Evening Standard, 27October 1916. Reproduced with permission of theBritish Cartoon Archive.Q3Starred men were increasingly made available for the forces as surplus men were‘combed out’ of civilian jobs. This provided fertile ground for cartoonists: the EveningNews, for example, published a series of ‘Cuthbert’ cartoons, the first (Figure 1) dated27 October 1916, drawn by Percy Fearon, known as Poy, depicting white rabbitsdisappearing down ‘funk holes’, lying low in a ‘cushey [sic] place’ and a ‘cushy bed’,trying to avoid ‘the comb’.29 Inspired by Lewis Carroll’s character in Alice’s Adventuresin Wonderland, the white rabbits, who were ‘feeble’ and ‘nervously shilly-shallying’,served as a symbol of those who deliberately attempted to avoid military duty.30 Indeed,in 1933 the term ‘Cuthbert’ entered the Oxford English Dictionary as ‘a slang name fora man who deliberately avoids military service; esp. in the war of 1914–18, one whodid so by securing a post in a Government office or the Civil Service; a conscientiousobjector’.31 A poem in Punch entitled ‘England’s call to the Rabbit’ instructed themto ‘Slack not nor shirk for very shame’ nor ‘share the Cuthbert’s fate,/but chuck yourrole of coward’, in order to ‘face the music like a man’.32 The poem makes explicit theunmanliness of cowardly Cuthbert, a slacker who shirked his duty. Such widespreadnegative constructions of civilian masculinity arguably placed the man on the homefront in a precarious position.Some starred men certainly resisted conscription, wishing to remain on the homefront. James Humpfreys, a carpenter, house-painter and bicycle-shop owner, appealeda number of times against his call-up on the grounds that he repaired bicycles for sixty-four villagers and that as he had had twenty-six teeth removed and his gums couldnot accommodate false teeth, he ate just one meal daily. This caused ‘great hilarity’ inhis Essex village.33 Removing starred men’s protected status and directing them to theforces could, however, cause popular unrest: 12,000 workers in the skilled engineeringunions in Sheffield, for example, went on a two-day strike from 16 to 18 November1916 following the debadging of Leonard Hargreaves, a fitter at Vickers, who wascalled up into the Army Service Corps.34 Vickers, a heavy metal trades specialist thatproduced steel, arms and machinery at its Sheffield plant that employed 10,807 menin late 1916, had withheld documents that would have enabled Hargreaves to appeal© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:48123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748British Civilian Masculinity and Reserved Occupations, 1914–45 7against the decision to conscript him.35 The firm’s collusion with the military authoritiesby debadging Hargreaves was deemed a ‘deliberate violation of the pledges given’ toskilled workers and was regarded as a form of industrial conscription.36 Strike actionwas ended by Hargreaves’ release from the forces. These men undoubtedly had theirreasons for wishing to remain in civilian jobs, which are now, 100 years later, harder torecover, given the absence of archived oral recordings with badged workers. However,given the continued potency of the nineteenth-century bourgeois ideology of ‘separatespheres’ in which manliness was associated with the capacity to provide for one’sfamily, we might surmise that earning a secure wage and fulfilling the breadwinnerrole from which they derived status and self-esteem, were highly prized, as was alsothe case in the Second World War.A Schedule of Protected Occupations was compiled, providing differing levels ofsafeguards to skilled men according to their occupations, ages and medical categories.Reginald Gibbs noted in his diary: ‘Thank Heaven! I have got a six-months’ exemp-tion. It is lucky for me that coaching up young aristocrats in Mathematics, Scienceand Engineering is considered very important War Work’.37 In December 1917, theMinistry of National Service began to compile a list of reserved occupations to ensurethat industry did not forfeit skilled men, that skilled workers transferred from lessessential jobs to ones of national importance and that men could be released for theforces without disrupting vital services and trade. These tended to be manual jobs suchas engineering and mining, although some white collar professions were also includedsuch as chemist and teacher.38 Moreover, it was proposed that men in all occupationsunder a particular age should be liable to military conscription and their exemptioncertificates be removed. This was eventually put into effect in February 1918 with thepassing of the Military Service (No. 1) Act and the Military Service (No. 2) Act passedtwo months later. The Schedule of Protected Occupations was revised, a ‘clean cut’was introduced raising the minimum age of exemption for workers in protected jobsto twenty-three, and two age limits were set for those in non-protected work, belowwhich men were conscripted into the forces. After three years of trial and error, inwhat was to be the last nine months of the war, the government finally implementeda scheme to balance the needs of industry and the forces, so that, as Gerry DeGroothas noted, ‘the army tail no longer wagged the government dog’.39 On the eve of theArmistice, 2.5 million men were officially regarded as being in a reserved occupation.‘Reserved men’: civilian masculinities in the Second World WarAs a new war became increasingly likely, the government issued a pamphlet in Novem-ber 1938 informing the public that a list of reserved occupations was being drawn upin case of a national emergency. Sir John Anderson, the Lord Privy Seal (a governmentoffice dating back to the early fourteenth century but which by the twentieth centurywas essentially a ministerial role without portfolio), noted in the House of Commonsin December:It will be made clear that these [reserved] persons can best serve the State by remaining at the workfor which they have been trained. That is the form of national service in which they can be mostuseful, and it is from outside their ranks that the Government will look, at any rate in the initialstages, to find the recruits for all the various Defence services.40© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:481234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647488 Gender & HistoryThe Schedule listed occupations alphabetically, from ‘accountant’ to ‘zinc manufac-Q4ture’; nearly 300 in total.41 There was an assortment of ‘white collar’ professionaloccupations, such as architect and pathologist; lower middle-class jobs, such as Frenchpolisher and jeweller; and heavy industry trades, such as foundry worker and dockworker. The Schedule covered about five million men. A number printed next to aparticular occupation referred to the age at which the worker became reserved. Thus,men employed in these occupations who were at or above the age listed were preventedfrom enrolling for military service. The lower the occupation’s age of reservation, themore important the role. The job of lighthouse keeper was reserved at eighteen, lockkeeper at twenty-one, cutler at twenty-three and coastguard at twenty-five, while therole of trade union official was reserved at thirty and shop assistant at thirty-five. Reser-vation was therefore on a block system: men were automatically reserved en masse ifthey belonged to particular occupational groups if they were of or above a specific age,irrespective of the exact work in which they were engaged.The Provisional Schedule was widely commentated upon in parliament, by boththe national and local press and by trade unions. Anthony Crossley, ConservativeMember of Parliament (MP) for Stretford, noted: ‘The booklet might well have beenheaded: “You will be serving your country best by being a scrimjack”’, which had closeassociations with the First World War term shirker.42 Conservative MP for Wycombe,Major-General Sir Alfred Knox, questioned: ‘Does the right hon. Gentleman realisethat this Schedule as it stands at present prevents thousands of patriotic men doingtheir duty, and also gives an excuse to many others who want to “scrimshank” outof this duty?’43 Some MPs questioned the inclusion of certain occupations, such aschocolate confectioner and gardener: ‘Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that an expertrhododendron grower has been refused to be allowed to enlist because he is in a reservedoccupation?’44 The tone of each of these pre-war comments questioning the patriotismof reserved men makes clear that their position was a precarious one, undermined byrepresentatives of the very institution that prevented their enlistment.As Britain readied itself for war, the Schedule was frequently modified in prepa-ration for the necessary balancing of military and civilian manpower. At the outbreakof hostilities, the Schedule was quickly implemented, illustrating the government’srecognition of the importance of industrial mobilisation; so too was military conscrip-tion with the passing of the National Service (Armed Forces) Act on 3 September1939. In the first three months, 1.25 million men aged eighteen to forty-one, withouta conscientious objection, who passed the medical examination and were not engagedin occupations listed on the Schedule, were called up to join the armed service of theirchoice. In contrast, the mobilisation of industrial manpower was sluggish. Moreover,while the Schedule precluded skilled men’s conscription into the forces, it did notguarantee employment on the home front. Despite the 1.25 million men in the servicesand a further 1.25 million employed in Civil Defence (such as Air Raid Precautionsand the Auxiliary Fire Service), three months after the outbreak of war, there werestill 1.4 million unemployed men.45 Many men who were skilled in a trade listedon the Schedule were without work, some of them had been for many years, havingexperienced the emasculating effects of the Depression.The issue of civilian unemployment remained contentious for months. The DailyMirror, in February 1940, lambasted ‘the ridiculous situation by which men are for-bidden to work, and are at the same time asked to make their mightiest effort ever’.46© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:48123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748British Civilian Masculinity and Reserved Occupations, 1914–45 9The Minister of Labour repeatedly had to respond to MPs’ questions about reservedmen who were unemployed. Those unable to find employment in their registered cate-gory were permitted to find employment elsewhere and from May 1940, men who hadbeen unemployed for two months were permitted to volunteer for any civil defenceorganisation or armed service. This change was part of a new scheme for the full mobil-isation of manpower following the formation of a Coalition Government. The Ministryof Labour and National Service, now headed by Ernest Bevin, a Trade Union officialrather than an elected MP, was empowered to control all human and material resources.It was authorised to direct any individual into any form of work and to exercise fullyexisting but little used powers over essential industries. In contrast to the First WorldWar, in which trade unions were bitterly opposed, industrial conscription was acceptedby both organised labour and employers. One of the first policies implemented wasto prohibit miners and agricultural workers, many of whom had already left to findbetter paid employment elsewhere, from working outside their industries. Ex-shipyardworkers were also quickly reassigned to the shipyards.As military manpower needs grew, the numbers covered by the Schedule werereduced. Some occupations were removed from the Schedule, while the age of reserva-tion for others was adjusted upwards so as to de-reserve men. By the end of 1940, fewworkers under twenty-five were reserved.47 From early 1941, all reserved men, with theexception of those in ‘scarcity’ occupations, were permitted to join the RAF; £47,000was spent on newspaper advertising for recruits for RAF ground tradesmen and aircrews from among men in reserved occupations.48 The Daily Record and Mail ran anadvertisement in September 1941 purporting to be the words of a previously reservedman: ‘I was a motor fitter. But I wasn’t satisfied – No sir! Thinks I, I’m fighting fitand only twenty-seven. I could be giving it back to Jerry, up there!’ The advertisementinformed men that ‘Even if reserved you can fly with the RAF’. ‘“I never regrettedswopping my old job – important as it was” . . . You won’t regret it either if you followhis example’.49 The notice identified a list of reserved occupations, such as carpen-ter, builder, blacksmith and bank clerk, which had released men into the RAF. Thisindicates a hierarchy of acceptable public service, in which even the state-mandatedretention of personnel in specific jobs could be got round through volunteering in theair force. That it was the RAF, rather than the Army or Navy that was permitted wasundoubtedly a result of the type of war that had unfolded. The Battle of Britain in thesummer of 1940, followed shortly by the Blitz, had taken a heavy toll on air crew andmore men were required to replenish that service. For one diarist, an office workerfrom Ashton-under-Lyme, these advertisements were ambiguous and confusing:Advertisement in Guardian [newspaper] about reserved men and flying duties; this is very misleadingas RAF will not accept reserved men who have not been released by their firm. Very few firms willrelease their men. Rather unfair to men like myself, who even, given reasonable health, would notbe released by their firms. I have tried unsuccessfully 5 times, and was given my present job onthe strict understanding that I would not attempt to leave again. Other men tried considerably moreoften to my knowledge. These advertisements cause disaffection in factories and must gain veryfew replies.50These advertisements suggested an opportunity to join up but for many this wasunattainable. Like this diarist, twenty-eight of the fifty-six men interviewed in 2013and 2014 tried to evade their reserved status and enlist; only six were successful.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:4812345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474810 Gender & HistoryThis failure to serve in uniform caused resentment among some intervieweeswho were frustrated that the state was preventing them from joining up. ThomasCarmichael, an apprentice engineer in Ardrossan, and Walker Leith, an apprenticetelephone engineer in Aberdeen, both stated that they were ‘stuck’ in a reservedoccupation, while John Stephenson, who worked on the railways in Northallerton,stated that he was ‘fastened down’.51 These men were static, rendered immobile by thestate while many of their peers had been posted abroad. Their desire to serve in uniformin a combatant role superseded the state’s avowal of their value. They saw combat asthe only acceptable manly role in wartime, resented that the state consigned them,against their will, to a position subordinate to the ‘soldier hero’, and felt diminished asmen in their war work roles. Ron Spedding, who worked in a railway wagon works inDurham, articulated his desire in his memoir:As very young men [we] had actually looked forward to the day when we could join the armedforces and do our bit for King and Country. We would often imagine and fancy ourselves in amilitary uniform parading behind a brass band and sporting medals received for courage and valour.We really did believe that the most important thing in life was to fight and destroy the enemy, winthe war and earn a share in the final victory and the glory . . . I remember feeling peeved and also alittle guilty when some of my friends joyously told me they had been released and were off to jointhe Air Force.52Spedding’s youthfulness is key to his desire to don uniform, and certainly the menwho were interviewed in 2013 and 2014 were the youngest reserved workers, agedbetween eighteen and twenty-eight when the war ended. None had children and allbut seven were single. Middle-aged, married fathers might have been less susceptibleto the lure of martial uniform. Certainly, my maternal grandfather, a policeman inLondon, was frustrated that he had to leave his wife and two young children whenhe lost his reserved status and was compelled to join the army. For him and manyothers, being in a reserved occupation was not experienced as emasculating. Indeed,twenty-eight of the fifty-six men interviewed, exactly half, did not attempt to join theservices, recognising that the state needed them to continue their work.Some were very comfortable with their wartime status. Charles Lamb, a Dundeeapprentice shipwright, asserted: ‘I felt very happy [about being in a reserved occupa-tion] actually . . . I didn’t fight against it. No, no I was quite happy, maybe cowardlyin one way but I had to think of number one’.53 While Lamb was content to remainon the home front as it suited him, his use of the word ‘cowardly’ reveals that thisnegative sentiment overshadowed the civilian man. Others were much more confident,however, in recognising their own worth. John Dickson, a Glasgow shipyard worker,stated that there was ‘no point in robbing Peter to pay Paul. Or taking a skilled engineerout of skilled engineering to be a soldier’.54 Alexander Davidson, a Portsmouth-basedboat builder, similarly asserted ‘It was no good having sailors if you’d got nothingto sail them in. If you hadn’t got any boats . . . The soldiers couldn’t fight withoutrifles’.55 Such accounts reveal that the reserved worker could carve out a place that heconsidered equal to that of the man in uniform.Certainly, too many men in the forces and too few workers in munitions wouldmean that the surfeit of service personnel would be ill-equipped, lacking weapons,tanks, ships and aircraft with which to wage war and the home front would beleft without essential supplies. Conversely, insufficient numbers of servicemen and© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:48123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748British Civilian Masculinity and Reserved Occupations, 1914–45 11excessive numbers of civilian workers would lead to stockpiles of artillery, lost battlesand increasing numbers of casualties. Or as The Times succinctly noted in January1941: ‘recruits are no use without equipment; equipment is no use without recruits’.56Yet criticisms continued to be voiced. In March 1941, John Profumo, a twentysix-year-old Conservative MP for Kettering, and a commissioned officer in the RoyalArmoured Corps, made a provocative statement in the Commons lambasting the reser-vation policy which was reminiscent of MPs’ parodies of occupations listed on theProvisional Schedule in early 1939:But has the House thought that here are still in this country great numbers of men who ought tojoin up – young men like myself, capable, fit, with the muscle but without the will, men who arehiding behind the cloak of what are called reserved occupations? I could lay my hands on manysuch men, although I would prefer to lay my feet on them. I could give an example such as theman who calls himself a specialised ladies’ corset cutter. Is it more important for us to lace up ourfemale sex than to lace the enemy? Up and down the country there are men who should be joiningthe Colours before we make all our women into soldiers, sailors and airmen. Let us rout out thesepeople and put them into the Forces.57Inflammatory statements such as this inciting violence towards men who were notin uniform make patently clear that the civilian male faced a continual struggle toestablish that he was legitimately not in service uniform. It also created a climate inwhich white feathers were handed out.The practice of presenting white feathers from a game cock’s tail, regarded as asign of inferior breeding, to men of conscription age in civilian clothing has a longhistory and was particularly widespread during the First World War. Admiral CharlesPenrose Fitzgerald commissioned thirty Folkestone women on 30 August 1914 withthe charge of dispensing feathers to young men not in uniform with the intention ofshaming them into volunteering. Newspaper articles and theatre sketches ensured thatthe practice spread elsewhere, as recollections about this humiliating act captured ininterviews conducted by the Imperial War Museum make evident. George Wilkinson,a chemist in County Durham, was exempted from the forces and was on the receivingend of ‘very hurtful’, ‘very distressing’ ‘rude remarks’ about him not being in khaki,which inclined him to stay at home rather than venture out on to the street wherehe ran the risk of being ‘insulted’.58 John Dorgan recalled that his eighteen-year-oldbrother Nichol who was working in a reserved occupation in a colliery, received awhite feather in an envelope in the post. ‘He got up off the table, white face, went outof the house and that was the last time I ever saw the lad. He left the house and went tothe Recruitment agent in Newcastle and joined the Durham Light Infantry’.59 This wasnot an unusual response: before conscription was introduced in January 1916 manymen were propelled into recruitment offices having received a white feather.60 Nichol’scajoling into enlistment had tragic consequences as he was wounded in France andsubsequently died.The masculinities of non-uniformed men were called into question when theywere presented with feathers or, even more unequivocally, petticoats. These feminisedsubstitutes for khaki uniform underscored the perceived emasculation of such men.61By targeting those perceived to have failed in their performances of masculinity, youngwomen were, as Nicoletta Gullace notes, ‘policing manhood’.62 The rekindling of thisFirst World War phenomenon occurred with sufficient frequency in 1940 and 1941 to© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:4812345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474812 Gender & Historybe mentioned in a 1942 publication.63 When Falkirk-born Tom Myles became eligiblefor the forces he hoped to join the navy. But because the final figure of his nationalregistration number had been randomly selected in a ballot, he was instead conscriptedinto the coal mines along with 48,000 young men who were popularly known as‘Bevin Boys’, named after the Minister of Labour who devised the scheme in 1944 tosubstantially increase the numbers of those working in the pits. This came as an ‘awfuldisappointment . . . I can remember how, och, utterly disappointed I was when mypapers came in. I just couldn’t believe that this was happening’. To this setback wasadded insult when he was presented with a feather, an episode Myles recalled vividly:A young able-bodied eighteen-year-old walking in the streets. ‘Why are you no[t] in the Army?’ . . .To be called a conscientious objector, and the Government made no move to advise people that thiswas happening . . . There was one [episode] in actual fact. It was a hen’s feather, and he came overand put it on the shoulder of my jacket ; . . . I can see and feel that whole episode to this day . . .[T]he way he looked at me.64While Myles ‘ignore[d] it and walk[ed] away’, these slurs aimed at young men not inuniform could have extreme consequences and a number of suicides were reported. Inan attempt to address this issue, the government considered developing a badge for thoserejected from military service on medical grounds. It was thought that men precludedfrom the forces ought, like the badged men of the First World War undertaking essentialjobs, to have a visible signifier of their patriotism to ward off accusations of cowardiceand shirking. Although such a badge was never introduced, consideration of thismeasure does suggest that overt shaming of those out of uniform was not uncommon.Yet none of the fifty-six interviewees recalled any such emasculating episodes:Harold Stranks, who worked in the laboratory at Porton Down, asserted: ‘I neverdetected any animosity at all’.65 John Scholey, an engineer at Rolls Royce in Leicester,noted there was ‘no stigma attached to it at all’ and William McNaul, a Glasgowrailway guard, stated ‘nobody thought that you were dodging anything’.66 A numberof interviewees noted that it was understood that some would serve in the forceswhile others would remain on the home front in essential industry. Timothy Brown,an engineer in Gateshead, recalled, ‘I was never sort of picked on and said “Well whyare you not in the army?” or anything. There was never any problems. Everybodyjust seemed to accept you were either working or you were in the forces. Nobodybothered’.67 Similarly, Charles Hill, a Birmingham toolmaker, asserted: ‘nobody saidanything to me . . . [I wasn’t] criticised for it. I think it was an accepted thing becausethe government decided “you do this, you that and you do that”. And well, you can’targue’.68The state did periodically revise its decisions, however. A key change whichreleased reserved men into the forces was the replacement in December 1941 of blockreservations by occupation with that of individual deferments: a man now had to bedoing a vital job in a key establishment in a reserved industry as well as meet the agerequirements. Individual deferments could only be granted to men undertaking workof the utmost importance. This combing out of men from essential industries, whichwas made possible by the mobilisation of women, resulted in a gradual de-reservationby age groups, the disappearance of occupational reservation and the implementationof individual deferment of men according to the importance of their work.69 With thischange from block reservation to individual deferment, the official policy of reservation© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:48123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748British Civilian Masculinity and Reserved Occupations, 1914–45 13came to an end and the Schedule ceased to exist. A system akin to that used in the FirstWorld War, with military service tribunals making decisions about recruits, then wentinto effect. From 1942, reserved men were required periodically to complete a formgiving information about the nature of their duties to ensure that individually they weremaking an adequate contribution to the national war effort.The conscription of an as-yet-untapped source of labour was thus key to the end-ing of reservation. The state initially was reluctant to mobilise women, believing that,as in the First World War, under-utilised male workers would fulfil the labour require-ments. However, in 1941, Britain began a measured policy of conscripting women toundertake war work which during the course of the war would go further than any othercountry, including the Soviet Union. The National Service (No. 2) Act in December1941 made single women between twenty and thirty liable to conscription, and thiswas later extended to widen the age range from nineteen to fifty, to include marriedwomen and to introduce part-time work. Roughly 7.5 million women were working inindustry and the auxiliary forces at its peak in September 1943.70 Concurrent with theincreasing numbers of women within the labour force was their entry into industrieswhich were previously male-dominated, their increased wages, newly acquired skills,heightened sense of self-worth and the recognition of their value in wartime film andprint media.71 These all had the potential to undermine civilian masculinity. Moreover,in reconstructing their own wartime work in oral history interviews conducted decadesafter the war, many women either failed to recall the presence of young men on thehome front or dismissed their young male co-workers as being not ‘fit’ to serve inthe forces. A secretary employed in the Vickers Armstrong Factory in Blackpool toldinterviewer Penny Summerfield: ‘There was no men. The men were all away’ but laterrecalled that those she worked alongside were either ‘older men, over forty five’ or‘hadn’t passed the medical for the Forces’.72 Female war workers had the potentialto render the civilian man’s masculinity unstable, their presence a continual reminderthat women had been drafted to undertake similar work.Despite these unprecedented changes, male workers still comprised 61 per centof the wartime workforce, half of whom were labelled ‘reserved’, and many work-places – including coal mines, railways, garages, iron and steel works, shipyards anddocks – remained masculine spaces and did not witness a surge, nor even a trickle,of women workers. Theirs was still tagged ‘men’s work’. Moreover, female workerswere considered as being there only for the duration and there was a lack of in-vestment in their training: unlike male apprenticeships, which might have lasted up toseven years, women’s instruction often lasted just a few weeks. When complicated workpractices were broken down to their component parts, fragmentation and deskilling ledto devalued status. Women were regarded as unskilled ‘dilutees’ watering down theconcentrated skilled male labour so that it went further. The definition of women’s workas largely unskilled undoubtedly influenced the perception of civilian male workers.Moreover, women were often regarded as subordinate to male workers, assisting themwith their more intricate work. Mass Observation, the social research organisationformed in 1937 to produce an anthropology of ordinary British people’s lives, noted:‘The atmosphere is rather that the women are helping the men and temporarily takingover for the men to do something more important. The atmosphere is strictly mas-culine still’.73 The positioning of women in the background of the poster ‘CombinedOperations Includes You’ makes this evident (Figure 2), as does the line in railway© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:4812345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474814 Gender & HistoryFigure 2: Harold Pym, ‘Combined Operations In-clude You’, The Admiralty, undated, courtesy TheNational Archives, Kew.75worker Roy Spedding’s poem, ‘Women also work in this man’s domain/To help theQ5war effort, they explain’.74Men’s status as breadwinners also remained unchanged as the average wartimeearnings of women in comparison to men increased only marginally from 48 per centpre-war to about 52 per cent by 1945.76 Consequently, trade unions, which continuedto be male-dominated and prioritised the interests of male workers, were kept on side.The far greater use of women in the Second World War than the First paradoxicallyresulted in a bolstering of civilian masculinity, since these ‘dilutees’ reinforced thespecial value of skilled male workers.Moreover, there were other ways in which masculinity was enhanced, includingfull employment, long hours and high wages. In contrast to the Depression, whenover 3.2 million men were without work at its peak in the summer of 1932, maleunemployment fell from 1.7 million in 1938 to a mere 60,000 in June 1943.77 Theaverage working week increased from 47.7 hours in October 1938 to 52.9 hours in July1943.78 ‘We work as we’ve never worked before’, noted railwayman Roy Spedding.79Q6This resulted in wages increasing, which was especially rapid between 1939 and 1941.80Essential workers such as those employed in aircraft factories enjoyed wage rises ofup to 71 per cent.81 Moreover, male workers earned more than most soldiers: a newly© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:48123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748British Civilian Masculinity and Reserved Occupations, 1914–45 15Figure 3: Sidney Strube, ‘Put It There!’, The Ad-miralty, undated, courtesy The National Archives,Kew.84conscripted unmarried private was paid about £3 a week after deductions whereas theaverage civilian male took home over £5 a week.82 Some highly skilled individualsearned double that. In one exceptional case, a sheet metal worker assembling fuselageswho was working a ninety-hour week took home £25.83 The Second World War hadthe potential to shore up civilian masculinity that had been greatly diminished by thejoblessness of the 1930s.Moreover, civilian male workers were depicted positively during the war. Postercampaigns included brawny industrial workers endeavouring to emphasise the impor-tance to the war effort of men on the home front. ‘Put it there!’, for example, depicted amale shipyard worker and a Royal Navy sailor shaking hands, their muscularity crush-ing a German U-boat (Figure 3). Such posters made visual links between soldieringand working, emphasising parity of service.This was noted by a Customs and Excise worker at the Swansea docks: ‘Thegovernmant [sic] is drawing a parallel between men in the services and men workingon the “Home Front”’.85 Documentary films also showed civilian men in a positivelight. Transfer of Skill (1940), directed by Geoffrey Bell, shows how the skills ofcraftsmen were applied to war-related work: a pre-war jeweller is shown makingprecision instruments, a watchmaker produces shell fuses. ‘These are the men behindthe front line’, states the narrator. ‘On the skill of their hands we depend to fashion ourmachines of war’.Positive representations of manual workers can be found in the paintings of officialwar artist Stanley Spencer, collectively known as Shipbuilding on the Clyde. Despitesketching women workers at the Kingston shipyard in Port Glasgow, all but one ofSpencer’s eight paintings featured only male labourers. The paintings were, then, astudy of the men, a celebration of the physically tough nature of the work and anacknowledgment of communality, cooperation, collective endeavour and camaraderie.Spencer paints these men as individuals, absorbed in their own personal task. Colourand lighting are used to dramatic effect to interrogate the interplay between man andmachine. The Edinburgh Evening News commented that Spencer provided ‘a vividimpression of life in a Clyde shipbuilding yard. The hundreds of workers . . . are seen© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltdgend12246 W3G-gend.cls August 29, 2016 13:4812345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474816 Gender & Historyworking like very demons. There are no slackers on the Clyde’.86 The reference toslacking suggests that there was no such perception that these men were not fulfillingtheir duty.Another way in which the Second World War bolstered civilian masculinity to agreater extent than in the First was through the increased dangers brought about by theBlitz. This put civilians at greater risk, albeit briefly, than some of their contemporariesin the forces, many of whom would have been in non-combatant roles (such as RAFground crew and Army logistics) or undertaking training far away from battle zones.Casualties from aerial bombing did occur, albeit relatively infrequently, while workerswere labouring in factories, docks and on trains, as Helen Jones has stated.87 Astoolmaker Frank Harvey noted, this happened because ‘you always stayed whereyou worked’.88 During a raid on Coventry in November 1940, in which over twentyfactories were destroyed, engineering workers were killed at their place of work.89 Andof course firefighters sustained heavy losses. Enduring risk manfully was another waythat masculinity could be affirmed. Roy Spedding refers to ‘the occasional bomb/WeQ7are sick and tired, but carry on’.90 Thus, in addition to working and bringing homea wage, reserved workers confronted the risk of bodily damage and death not unliketheir counterparts in the forces, which enabled them to construct manly accounts ofstoic endurance.ConclusionIn both wars, industry was in direct competition with the military for a limited supplyof men. The state needed to mobilise labour just as much as it needed combatantsto fill the ranks of the armed services. Despite attempts to retain men with essentialskills on the home front during the First World War, too many skilled men were ableto enlist into the forces. Those men who remained on the home front were deridedas shirkers and cowards. Civilian men therefore had to negotiate their relegation tothe subordinate status of unmanly ‘other’. Whereas errors were made during the FirstWorld War, with the government lurching from one manpower crisis to another, a moresystematic approach was adopted in the Second. Austen Chamberlain, the Chairmanof a First World War organisation that became the Ministry of National Service, spokeof an ‘industrial army’ being raised which would supply the military forces. Whilemerely rhetoric in the First World War, this became a reality in the Second. As aconsequence, men who were prevented by the state from enlisting during the SecondWorld War had largely positive recollections and while some resented being confinedto the home front, many were empowered by job security, high wages, female dilutees,positive cultural representations and additional risks from aerial bombing. These werenot shirkers, scrimshanking their way out of their patriotic duty. Rather, as Churchillasserted, they were ‘soldiers with different weapons but the same courage’.91NotesI would like to thank Arthur McIvor and Linsey Robb with whom I wrote the forthcoming book Men in Reserve:British Civilian Masculinities in the Second World War (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2016) whichQ8was made possible by generous funding from the AHRC (AH/K00011X/1 ‘Masculinities Challenged?
