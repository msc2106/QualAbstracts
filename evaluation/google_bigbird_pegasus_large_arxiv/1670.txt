ABSTRACT: 
In this paper, we elaborate on the premises of studying problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. Due to the growing medicalisation of research on problem substance use and disparities in this group, policy makers, health researchers and practitioners often feel compelled to rely on epidemiological studies when grounding and understanding the link between ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment disparities. We argue that the bulk of epidemiological research suffers from crucial methodological and conceptual flaws that necessitate a reconsideration of their usefulness in policy and treatment practice. First, epidemiological research is based on static concepts of ethnicity and race as primordial analytical categories. Second, and as a consequence of the first argument, such research rarely distinguishes sufficiently between ethnic and non-ethnic determinants and mechanisms influencing problem substance use and treatment disparities. And third, these studies often depart from methodological individualism and subordinate contextual and structural determinants and mechanisms. This paper aims to re-evaluate (the factors and mechanisms mediating) the relationship between ethnicity, the nature of problem substance use, and treatment disparities, and to overcome some of the gaps in existing research methods mentioned above. More specifically, this implies (1) a critical revision of the ethnicity concept in epidemiology, (2) the inclusion of non-ethnic determinants and mechanisms by means of applying intersectional analysis and ethnic boundary making perspectives, (3) the broadening of methodological individualism in order to include all levels (from micro to macro) and loci (individual, community, society) of research in holistic research designs. Such ‘‘doubled research’’ allows researchers to analyse and have an impact on treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities.

Treatment disparities such as lower treatment completion rates, lower presence in treatment and self-reports of inadequate treatment among migrants and ethnic minorities have also been documented (Derluyn et al., 2008; Vandevelde, Vanderplasschen, & Broekaert, 2003; Verdurmen, Smit, Toet, Van Driel, & Van Ameijden, 2004). Furthermore, greater susceptibility to depressive symptoms and other mental health issues have been documented among migrants and ethnic minorities when compared to people without a migration background (Alegrı´a et al., 2008; Missinne & Bracke, 2012). To understand and act upon diverging substance use prevalence rates and treatment disparities, it is necessary to understand the processes that influence these outcomes at the individual and societal levels. The causal relationship between stressors in the social and physical environment and socio-economic status on the one hand and health status on the other is well documented (Marmot, 2016; Schulz et al., 2008; Warnecke et al., 2008). That is to say, quantitative epidemiological research demon- strates that migrants and ethnic minorities, when taking into account the risk factors of higher unemployment rates, limited language skills, fewer educational opportunities, intergenera- tional conflict, acculturation difficulties and greater peer pressure, are deemed to be more susceptible to problem substance use-related problems (Otiniano Verissimo, Grella, Amaro, & Gee, 2014; Reid et al., 2001; Savage & Mezuk, 2014). Nevertheless, epidemiological outcomes are neither univocal when it comes to the impact of ethnicity, nor when it comes to how to instrumentalise the concept as a variable. Hunt, Schneider, and Comer, (2004) and Kulis, Marsiglia, and Nieri, (2009), among others, question, for instance, the dominance of the acculturation concept as a pivotal risk factor characteristic of migrant and ethnic minority groups in Correspondence: Charlotte De Kock Ghent University, Department of Criminology, Penal Law and Social Law, Institute for Social Drug Research (ISD), Universiteitstraat 4, Ghent, 9000 Belgium. E-mail: charlotte.dekock@ugent.be the epidemiological study of problem substance use and treatment disparities in these groups. Little is known about the nature of causal processes and social mechanisms underlying problem substance use (Burkhart, Gyarmathy, & Bo, 2011; Derluyn et al., 2008; Fountain et al., 2004) and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. Epidemiological research seems to have failed to incorporate some recent developments in the study and conceptualisation of ethnicity in sociology, anthropology and cultural studies. When studying ethnicity in any context, scientific rigour demands that we acknowledge that the ethnicity concept is very closely intertwined with individual alterity and societal inequality. The word ethnicity can be traced back to ethnos (people who are not a part of the Greek polis). In Hobbes’ Leviathan the word was used to denominate non-believers as opposed to Christians. Consequently, it is used to identify groups that are not a part of a certain nation, such as Afro Americans and Hispanic American in North American literature (Perron et al., 2009; Saloner and Le Cook, 2013). Nevertheless, the usefulness of the ethnic group as a unit of analysis is discussed in sociological literature (Barth, 1969/1998; Brubaker, 2004; Jenkins, 2011). A recurrent argument in sociology is that the term is grounded in racial theory. Furthermore, some sociologists argue that it might be useful in the North American context, but not in the European continent, because of its fundamentally different nation building principles and processes (Martiniello, 2013, pp. 19–23). In what follows we will use the term ‘‘migrants and ethnic minorities’’ because this combined terminology (Suijkerbuijk, 2014) stresses both the individual history of migration and ethnic ‘‘groupness’’ as well as the societal denomination and categorisation of ethnicity. One of the core issues in epidemiological studies is the often uncontested focus on migrants and ethnic minorities as static research units. In this paper, we argue that analysis does not rest with describing the strength and form of the relationship between variables; it should also address the deeper question of how such relationship was brought about (Hedstro¨m et al., 1998). We therefore want to explore the analytical tools used in research on problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. We will address the conceptual vagueness surrounding the ‘‘ethnicity’’ concept in researching problem substance use and treatment disparities. We start from a perspective that human behaviour can never be understood exclusively in terms of ethnic or other identity categories without consider- ing the socio-economic context and other macro levels in which behaviour occurs (Decorte, Jespers, Petintseva, & Tuteleers, 2016). The remainder of this paper will be structured as follows. We start by pointing out the analytical flaws in the use of ethnicity in epidemiological research (Section ‘‘Ethnicity in epidemiology’’). We give an overview of the concept of ethnicity in anthropology and sociology (Section ‘‘Ethnicity: Why ontology matters’’), introduce the importance of taking into account non-ethnic factors (Section ‘‘Non-ethnic factors and mechanisms’’) and present ethnic boundary making, intersectionality, mechanisms based theory and ecological and socio-cultural approaches as valuable supplements to social epidemiological studies (Section ‘‘Alternative and supple- mentary ways to study ethnicity’’). In the ‘‘Discussion’’ section, we link our conceptual objections (ethnicity as the sole unit of analysis) and methodological objections (meth- odological individualism and the lack of non-ethnic cate- gories and mechanisms) to critically address current (social) epidemiological studies of problem substance use and treat- ment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. We conclude with some possible ways forward for future research (Section ‘‘Concluding remarks’’). Ethnicity in epidemiology Epidemiological research into the causal relation between ethnicity and problem substance use predominantly focuses on the impact of migration (Derluyn et al., 2008; Hunt et al., 2004; Taı¨eb, Baubet, Ferradji, & Moro, 2008), and on biological and cultural characteristics (Meer, Nayak, & Pande, 2015; Smaje, 1996). These studies offer quantified information on, among others, ethnic differences in treatment (Perron et al., 2009), epidemiological differences between ethnic groups (Clark, Nguyen, & Kropko, 2013; Szaflarski, Cubbins, & Ying, 2011), differences in the substances used (Ompad, Galea, Fuller, Edwards, & Vlahov, 2005) or differences in methods of use (Cooper et al., 2008). Although these studies offer broad insights, we believe that the arguments that arose in the social turn in epidemiology (Wemrell, Merlo, Mulinari, & Hornborg, 2016) need specific attention in the epidemiological study of problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities because (1) the category of ethnicity is still deemed static in most research, (2) a distinction between ethnic and non-ethnic factors is rarely made and (3) a study of the prevalence of problem substance use and treatment disparities usually starts from methodological individualism, subordinat- ing contextual and structural factors. Taı¨eb et al. (2008) point out that Northern American epidemiological research has been improved by including factors such as birth place, duration of stay in the country and language. Nevertheless, this research still often points to acculturation and cultural identification as the main mediating factors for problem substance use among migrants and ethnic minorities and it can be argued that non-ethnic factors and mechanisms such as socio-economic, political and environ- mental factors, for example, are at least as important (Horyniak, Melo, Farrell, Ojeda, & Strathdee, 2016; Saloner et al., 2013; Taı¨eb et al., 2008). Also, the impact of racial theory in US-based epidemiology is still substantial, even though research has demonstrated that the biological impact of race on health is spurious and generally irrelevant (Lorusso & Bacchini, 2015; Meer et al., 2015; Smaje, 1996). Contrary to the available epidemiological research pub- lished within the English (mostly Northern American) language domain, in the existent French epidemiological research, and in the French language for that matter (Martiniello, 2013: 13), the term ‘‘ethnicity’’ is only rarely mentioned and distinctions between ethnic groups are rarely made. In the wake of rational choice theory but also classical 2 C. D Kock et al. Drugs: Education, Prevention and Policy, Early Online: 1–10 Marxism, French sociology has inspired a tradition in quantitative and variable-based epidemiological research that takes individuals and not ethnic groups as units of analysis (Wimmer, 2013, p. 17), while Northern American epidemiological studies focusing on, for example, Afro Americans or Hispanic Americans are paramount. Although the French focus on anti-differentialism and universalism avoids the pitfalls of possibly stigmatising culturalist com- munity studies, it does not sufficiently succeed in uncovering inequalities that are based in structural disparities among migrants and ethnic minority groups (Derluyn et al., 2008, p. 26). Without undervaluing existent intermediate stances in, for example, more recent Scandinavian epidemiological literature (Abebe, Hafstad, Brunborg, Kumar, & Lien, 2015), we present this binary in French and Northern American epidemiological literature because (1) it goes back to fundamentally different societal models that have inspired early sociology and today’s epidemiology in North America and Western Europe and (2) the bulk of leading epidemiological literature related to this topic is published in Northern America. Epidemiological research in which ethni- city, social inequality and perceived and structural discrim- ination are distinguished only rarely manages to comprehensively and systematically define the role of the construction of ethnicity from an individual, social and structural perspective as studied in these varying sociological traditions (Bourgois et al., 2006; Hunt et al., 2004; Philips, 2011 Taı¨eb et al., 2008). Additionally, methodological individualism is often the foundation of epidemiological research and results in the individual being used as the unit of analysis, and mediating factors such as structural or perceived dis- crimination being subordinated to individual properties, characteristics and actions. It requires that the drivers of history and social dynamics are individuals, and that social structures and outcomes can only be explained in terms of these individuals (Boudon et al., 1991). Or, as Yadavendu puts it: The entire shift of focus in epidemiological studies from the population to the individual, from social, economic and natural environmental factors to behavioral and bio- chemo-physiological factors is part and parcel of the shift in the philosophical paradigm from methodological holism to methodological individualism. This obfuscates the larger socio-economic causes of disease and ill health, and narrows down the quest for solutions to the individual and his behavior. (Yadavendu, 2001: 5187) Hence, we will start by presenting a critical analysis of the conceptual problems surrounding the notion of ‘‘ethni- city’’. We challenge the commonly held view that ethnicity is a primordial analytical category (Said, 1979; Vermeulen & Governs, 2003; Wimmer, 2013). Instead, we suggest that the ethnic boundary making perspective (Barth, 1969/1998; Martiniello, 2013; Wimmer, 2013), intersectional analysis, mechanism-based research and ecological and socio-cultural research designs are useful supplements to social epidemio- logical research that allow for the inclusion of non-ethnic factors and mechanisms and in-depth understanding of epidemiological causation. Ethnicity: Why ontology matters Anthropology and cultural studies are still in the process of trying to shake off the ‘‘old’’ Herderian essentialist concept of ethnicity that was fashionable in colonial anthropology. This Herderian concept conceives of ethnicity as a static equation of closely knit communities, clear-cut cultures and commonly shared categories (Wimmer, 2013). Although it is not our intention to present an in-depth analysis of this ‘‘old’’ view,1 it is suffice to say that in anthropological literature ethnic groups and cultures have moved from being conceived of as (1) primordial and essentialist notions, over (2) constructivist notions towards (3) intrinsic ‘‘ontological’’ concepts. Using the first essentialising notion implies defining the otherness of an ethnic group by means of positioning it in relation to the own ethnic framework (us–them). The second notion implies that a researcher must go in search of the construction processes of this same essentialised ethnic group. It implies a presupposition that ethic groups have certain characteristics, customs, etc., and that we want to uncover how they are constructed in other than the own ethnic group. The third, ‘‘ontological’’ notion recognises that the researcher’s ethnic background and own ethnic group may obscure critical understanding of ethnic processes and tries to uncover ethnicity in a way that affects the very understanding of the analytical concept of ethnicity in theory and society. This ontological turn in anthropology represents the view that the science of ethnicity is not an epistemological quest (how can we study a given group?) but an ongoing ontological project (what is the nature of what we study?). The relevance of this rupture for our purposes is that it embraces a fundamental critique, be it not the first, of the study of ethnic groups as substantive research units;2 in other words, ethnicity as an explanatory principle and opaque research unit versus something to be explained (Comaroff, 1978). It implies that ethnicity is no longer simply presumed and that its means of existence and construction processes become part of our research questions when studying migrants and ethnic minorities. The ethnic group in anthropology has long been studied by identifying its common characteristics based in shared language, customs and beliefs. Within such a reading of ethnicity, social interaction became subordinate to the iden- tification of ethnic groups. Defining ethnicity in terms of, for example, cultural characteristics has, however, been contested by making use of sociological characteristics and dynamics such as the structure of social relations (see Blau, 1975 for an overview of structuralist approaches) and functional group interests. Consequently, ethnicity itself could no longer be unilaterally defined by making use of cultural traits; it is, rather, a social and political construct used by actors in social interactions (Martiniello, 2013: 97). Or, as Jenkins (2011: 13) puts it, ‘‘Ethnic groups are what people believe or think them to be; cultural differences mark ‘group-ness’, they do not cause it; ethnic identification arises out of and within DOI: 10.1080/09687637.2016.1239696 Studying ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment 3 interaction between groups.’’ Beyond functionalist and structuralist notions, culture can be a consequence of ethnicity by giving a common meaning to a group but it does not necessarily do so (Nagel, 1986). Following Nagel, Martiniello defines ethnicity as (1) a means of social and political classification, (2) a manifestation of structural inequalities and (3) a variable in human history (Martiniello, 2013: 19). This instrumental definition is an extension of what Weber defined as an ethnic group, namely: Those human groups that entertain a subjective belief in their common descent because of similarities of physical type or of customs or both, or because of the memories of colonization and migration; this belief must be important for group formation; furthermore it does not matter whether an objective blood relationship exists. (Weber, 1922/1974, p. 18) Weber’s approach emphasises the subjective aspect and situational dependency of ethnicity in practice and theory. As such, Weber should be credited for broadening the study of political and societal phenomena in a manner that does justice to the impact of group and individual as agents in their context. He further defines the dynamic process of ethnic group formation as a process of social closure3 driven by hierarchies of power and prestige (in Wimmer, 2013: 206). Not surprisingly, Weber’s definition is still considered standard in current sociological research. Fredrik Barth (1969/1998) – considered the first anthropologist with a non-substantivist view on culture – argued that ethnic identity is a means to create boundaries that enable groups to distance themselves from one another and consequently argues that ethnic boundaries define a group rather than ‘‘the cultural stuff that encloses it’’ (Barth, 1969/1998: 15). Bell’s (1975) approach aligns with this performative perspective and hypothesised that ethnicity is a means for disadvantaged groups to claim a set of rights and privileges that the existing power structure has denied them (1975: 174). A major critique to this theory is the fact that not all ethnic groups are at liberty to make these strategic choices (Martiniello, 2013). The debate on the nature of ethnicity has of course influenced other (social) sciences. Epidemiology is espe- cially vulnerable to the critique of ethnicity that has been outlined above, because the discipline is defined as ‘‘the study of the distribution and determinants (risk factors) of health-related states or events and the application of this study to the control of diseases and other health problems’’ (WHO, 2016) and not especially in the deconstruction of what is conceived of as a determinant (risk factor), say ‘‘ethnic group identity’’ or acculturation. Epidemiology could consequently be conceived of as individual risk factor analysis and not particularly the study of societal influences and dynamics (Wemrell et al., 2016). We propose that epidemiological studies should take into consideration the interrelatedness of ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment disparities by including the study of individual micro-social, as well as group meso-social and macro-social mechanisms (Hedstro¨m et al., 2010; Jenkins, 2011; Martiniello, 2013; Wimmer, 2013). Non-ethnic factors and mechanisms A ‘full explanation’ goes from structural constraints of action to how actors operate within these constraints to how their actions aggregate back into the structural constraints that influence the next sequence of actions. (Wimmer, 2014, p. 837) There is a need to sharpen the focus of social epidemiology by returning to Weber’s methodological insistence on under- standing social action in order to causally explore its development and effects (Weber, 1922/1949). This view has recently been strongly advocated for by several social epidemiological researchers. Krieger (2012) and Ng and Muntaner (2014) argue for the inclusion of both macro-level societal forces and structures and social theory in epidemio- logical research. Meloni (2014) posits that social factors should be included in explanatory models of health. Merlo (2014) adds that the lack of a study of counter evidence (studying subjects who do not fit the models) troubles epidemiological results. Wemrell et al. (2016) advocate that the inclusion of social theory in epidemiological research is imperative for understanding quantitative epidemiological findings. Overall, social epidemiologists could benefit from alliances with and inclusion of social science theory, as demonstrated in Bourgois’ call for ‘‘a social science of medicine approach’’ (Bourgois et al., 2006). This brings us to the fact that very few studies in the domain of epidemiology and public health analyse the prevalence of ethnic discrimination (Shavers, Klein, & Fagan, 2012; Tran, Lee, & Burgess, 2010) among migrants and ethnic minorities and its link to problem substance use and treatment disparities. Kulis et al. (2009) were pivotal in pointing out that perceived discrimination should not be studied under the umbrella term of acculturative stress (which is common practice in epidemiological research, see Taı¨eb et al., 2008 and Hunt et al., 2004), and should instead be studied separately. Their study points out that perceived discrimination has in fact a much larger impact than other subcategories of acculturative stress such as language know- ledge. Alegrı´a, Pescosolido, Williams, and Canino (2011) add to this that the study of perceived discrimination should be broadened to structural discrimination at the institutional level – does the organisation of treatment services lead to service disparities, and if so, how? And how are these processes interrelated with individual behaviour? Gibbons et al. (2012) have found evidence for the fact that perceived discrimination is associated respectively with increased problem substance use (in adolescents who endorse problem substance use as a coping mechanism) and with the erosion of self-control which in turn increases reactivity to anger- producing events and problem substance use. Migrants and ethnic minorities suffer persistent perceived and structural discrimination (Smedley, 2012). Consequently, we should ask ourselves how this discrimination becomes embodied in (health) disparities. The methodological individualism (see Section ‘‘Ethnicity: Why ontology matters’’) that is the foundation of most epidemiological research holds that global properties and structures only influence individuals in the way they are 4 C. D Kock et al. Drugs: Education, Prevention and Policy, Early Online: 1–10 interpreted by these individuals. Consequently, it simply does not account for the maintenance and reproduction of inequalities in social outcomes. Accordingly, it seems inad- equate for understanding the unequal social outcome at hand: disparities in prevalence rates and treatment among migrants and ethnic minorities. When we study the individual we tend to forget the structure, and when researching the structure we tend to forget the individual. However, such reductionist views lessen the liability and usefulness of our research. Linking the structural to the individual level, taking into account accountability and agency, and uncovering power mechanisms, are key to understanding (health) inequalities in disadvantaged groups. Alternative and supplementary ways to study ethnicity In what follows, we will present four alternative and supplementary ways of studying ethnicity in the (social) epidemiological study of problem substance use and treat- ment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. Based on Bourdieu’s concept of ‘‘habitus’’, we present feminist intersectional analysis (Crenshaw, 1989) and Wimmer’s (2013) ethnic boundary making perspective. We also intro- duce the principles of mechanism-based research (Hedstro¨m & Swedberg, 1998; Hedstro¨m & Ylikoski 2010) and the novelty of holistic eco-social (Krieger, 2012) and socio- cultural (Alegrı´a et al., 2008, 2011) research frameworks as alternatives to methodological individualism. Bourdieu’s idea of ‘‘habitus’’ implies that the concepts of individual identity and societal structure are mutually consti- tutive in the practice of embodiment. More concretely, when considering ethnic identity, it implies that there is a need to study how individual and group identities are performed, constructed and reconstructed both by the individual and in society. Interpreting ethnicity in this way dynamically identifies how the making of ethnicity at the individual (micro), group (meso) and societal (macro) levels interacts with types of problem substance use and with pathways or barriers to treatment. Bourdieu’s perspective enables us to question how ethnicity is embodied and consequently perceived of by treatment facilities, and the other way around – how these facilities are embodied and perceived of by people considered to be migrants and/or belonging to ethnic minorities. These questions demand qualitative inquiry and are well suited to supplement quantitative epidemio- logical research in its quest to have an impact on treatment disparities. This approach ties in with Pollock’s (2012) and Shim’s (2005) critique of contemporary epidemiology in stating that the use of standardisation (e.g. the study of homogenous ethnic groups) as a basic way of avoiding error in this science results in the perpetuation and (re)production of social inequalities. Intersectionality Giritli Nygren and Olofsson (2014) stress that intersectional analysis (Crenshaw, 1989) can supplement social epidemi- ology because it reveals how categories (gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status) interact with each other and with epidemiological outcomes. Shim’s intersectional study of cardiovascular disease (2005) introduces a concrete way of qualitatively inquiring how the construction of ethnicity informs the occurrence and treatment of this disease in certain ethnic groups. Her theory can easily be transposed to the study of problem substance use and treatment disparities (Carliner, Delker, Fink, Keyes, & Hasin, 2016). Kapilashrami, Hill, and Meer, (2015) stress that scholars studying health inequalities can broaden micro-centred epidemiological research by understanding social dynamics intersectionally in order to gain insight into the structural drivers of inequalities. Talley and colleagues’ study of alcohol-use across sexual and ethnic minorities (Talley, Hughes, Aranda, Birkett, & Marshal, 2014) offers an inspiring example of how intersectionality studies can contribute to opening the black boxes of problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities by studying how sexual preference and ethnicity jointly intervene in the outcome of alcohol use. Intersectionality can be applied in quantitative epidemiological research (by measuring several variables, next to ethnicity) or by qualitatively understanding which other factors intervene in a quantitatively documented causal relation between two or more variables. Ethnic boundary making Wimmer’s ethnic boundary making perspective (2013) holds that the ontology of multicultural society is based on the erroneous assumption that societies are state-bound per se, and composed of ethnic groups involved in eternal struggles for dominance. He argues that in many societies class, region and clientelist fractions (such as economic, political and ethnically inspired interest groups) are much more prominent than cross-cutting ethnic categories (Wimmer, 2009: 257). Consequently, he argues for a ‘‘systematic disentangling of ethnic and non-ethnic processes’’ (Wimmer, 2013, p. 6). This perspective is aimed at understanding how ethnic boundaries are constructed and how this interferes with other social outcomes. This resonates with the presumption that cultural values are not the fundamental determinants of what people do (Jenkins, 2014, p. 209). Wimmer goes beyond the intersectional approach – recognising the coexistence of multiple interlocked cleavages such as gender, class, race – by engaging in disclosing the processes of making and unmaking these very cleavages through institutional incentives, positions in hierarchies of economic, political and symbolic power and existing social networks. Using Barth’s ethnic boundaries (see Section ‘‘Ethnicity: Why ontology matters’’), Wimmer examines cultural pro- cesses as grounded in classification and the production of group boundaries through boundary blurring, shifting and crossing. His added value in studying the relation between ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment disparities is the fact that he systematically describes economic, political and cultural processes in a multilevel, comparative and historical framework. Wimmer’s ‘‘ethnic boundary making’’ and Crenshaw’s intersectional approach (Crenshaw, 1989) align in great part with Brubaker’s (2004) view that the analysis of ethnicity should distinguish between what political leaders say about the relevance and pervasiveness of ethnicity on the one hand, DOI: 10.1080/09687637.2016.1239696 Studying ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment 5 and the everyday lived experience of members of an ethnic group on the other. It also ties in with the ontological anthropologist stance that ‘‘using axes of differentiation to conceptualise difference between social groups may lead to the recognition that such axes also apply within social groups’’ (Godelier & Strathern, 1991). In this context one could consider, for instance, the impact of ethnic conformity pressure (the pressure to conform to one’s symbolic ethnic group identity) (Van Kerckem, Van de Putte, & Stevens, 2013) and individual and group ethnic boundary maintenance on problem substance use and on treatment disparities. Furthermore, the creation and mainten- ance of reactive ethnic boundaries in response to structural or perceived discrimination (the strengthening of ethnic bound- aries because of perceived and actual non-acceptance in general society) can be expected to deeply influence both mental health (and possible problem substance use) (Saloner & Le Cook, 2013) and access to treatment. Mechanism-based theory Mechanism theorists argue against covering-law accounts that explain events by making reference to other events and deductively or inductively appealing to a law or general presupposition (Hedstro¨m & Swedberg, 1998; Hedstro¨m & Ylikoski, 2010). Covering-law accounts suffer from the problem that quantified effects could just as well explain their very causes. In our case, documenting the causal relationship and pathways between ethnicity and problem substance use or treatment disparities does not suffice. Mechanism-based research focuses on the properties, activ- ities, relations and interests of entities that produce effects in a certain phenomenon. Contrary to covering-law accounts, it presupposes that higher level mechanisms (e.g. ‘low presence of migrants and ethnic minorities in treatment centres’) are founded in lower level mechanisms (e.g. ‘high degrees of social closure because of perceived discrimination’). It hypothesises that the causal relation between A and B can only be explained by considering A and B not as opaque entities but as agents, properties, actions and relations in a time-related framework. Mechanism-based theory is based on opening the black box behind a macro-level observation. It is concerned with (1) how situational mechanisms of social structures constrain individual actions and cultural environ- ments, (2) describing action mechanisms linking individuals’ desires, beliefs, etc., to their actions and (3) specifying the transformational mechanisms through which people create (un)intended social outcomes. This is what shapes the macro- level association in mechanism-based theory (Hedstro¨m & Ylikoski, 2010). Operationalising these views in researching problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities would imply including a close study of how the individual perceives him or herself within society, and how this self-perception is interrelated with its context (both community and structure, e.g. treatment policies and struc- tural discrimination) and, ultimately, with problem substance use and treatment disparities. It should, however, be comple- mented with a meso-social (ethnic mobilisation and collective action) and a macro-social (structural constraints) level of research. Mechanism-based theory allows the root causes of the observed disparities to be understood, and creates a suitable base for intervention. Holistic eco-social and socio-cultural research designs As for the loci of researching the relationship between ethnicity on the one hand and problem substance use or treatment disparities on the other, we refer to Alegrı´a and colleagues’ ‘‘socio-cultural framework for mental health and problem substance use service disparities’’ (2011) and Krieger’s ecological model (2012). These are both models that offer systematic insight into the interplay of macro-, meso- and micro-level factors and mechanisms feeding into the social outcome of treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. Alegrı´a et al. (2011) go beyond the use of socio-demographic categories as proxies for culture, and focus on understanding the cultural repertoires available to patients and how cultural scripts influence service disparities. Krieger (2012) proposes an analysis of health inequality within the framework of the eco-social theory of disease distribution, thus taking into account individual, structural and social factors in understanding increased problem substance use and treatment disparities. Discussion We started out with the premise that both the effect of ethnicity and the process of constructing it are of equal importance in analysing problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. We have defined this target group as ‘‘migrants and ethnic minorities’’ to highlight the emphasis on (1) individual aspects of having a migration background, (2) the groupness of belonging to an ethnic minority and (3) being perceived as such. This definition highlights both the complex ontology of ethnicity and the individual and group characteristics that can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on the general well- being of migrants and ethnic minorities, their health status and (problem) substance use (e.g. combined risk factors such as acculturative stress, language difficulties, perceived dis- crimination, reactive identity formation and combined pro- tective factors such as ethnic groupness, solidarity, etc.). Epidemiological research that quantifies the causal relation between predefined migrant and ethnic groups (e.g. Afro Americans, Hispanic Americans, Sami Norwegians, Moroccan Belgians, etc.) is of limited use to treatment practice and policy making because it offers limited pathways to social change in both treatment and policy. The inclusion of intersectional analysis in quantitative social epidemiology enables an analysis of how mediating variables interact with one another, and an explanation of the weight and multi-layered interaction of gender, socio-eco- nomic status and ethnicity as they relate to problem substance use or treatment disparities.

(2015) suggest that this allows researchers to analyse social dynamics instead of social categories (ethnic groups) and consequently to study structural drivers instead of individual-level behaviour. The inclusion of an ethnic boundary-making perspective (Wimmer, 2013) in its turn allows for the in-depth study of 6 C. D Kock et al. Drugs: Education, Prevention and Policy, Early Online: 1–10 how ethnicity is constructed by migrants and ethnic groups themselves, in treatment and in general society. This type of research question allows the ethnicity concept in treatment theories to be reconsidered and is most useful in uncovering which ethnic boundaries in both majority and minority ethnic groups influence treatment disparities, and how they do so. Mechanism-based theory, in its turn, is a tool for social epidemiologists to go further than commonplace statistically significant causation between variables such as ethnic group and prevalence rates. Mechanism-based theory demands that the researcher goes in search of the cogs and wheels of these results, which in its turn makes research outcomes more useful for practitioners, ethnic minority members, prevention workers and policy makers. Lastly, we emphasised how holistic eco-social and socio- cultural research frameworks would allow the researcher to take into account micro-, meso- and macro-level mechanisms. Although specific and delineated research questions will imply a specific focus on one of these levels, the two remaining levels should always be taken into account in order for the research framework and perspective not to influence the results, for example by only studying individual migrants and/or single ethnic groups. Rather than taking an exclusively structuralist or individu- alist stance in the epidemiological study of ethnicity, we highlight the need for pragmatic and holistic research designs. This implies taking into account the goal of the research (analysing and challenging inequality) and the complex nature of the concept of ethnicity by means of, for instance, intersectional analysis or the ethnic boundary making per- spective. Methodologically speaking, we propose a mechan- ism-based analysis instead of covering-law accounts, and for the research framework we believe that the inclusion of micro, meso and macro levels in, for example, an eco-social or socio-cultural framework is paramount in understanding problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. In the figure below we schematically represent how the ethnic boundary making perspective, intersectional analysis and mechanism-based theory could be incorporated into the epidemiological study of the prevalence of problem substance use and/or presence rates in treatment. Levels of research Substance use Ethnicity related factors Non-ethnicity related factors Micro (individuals with a migraon background) Individual use and presence in treatment - Ethnic idenﬁcaon - Ethnic / religious views on use - Consequences of ethnic conformity pressure - Language issues - Etc. - SES, gender, class - Educaon - Idenﬁcaon paerns - User career - Treatment trajectory - Perceived discriminaon - Migraon history - Etc. Meso (migrant groups, ethnic minories and treatment facilies) (ethnic) Group prevalence and presence in treatment - Boom-up ethnic organizaon - Culturalist treatment measures - Ethnic groupness - Etc. - SES (socio-economic status) - Educaon - Migraon history - Treatment policy - Etc. Macro (socio-economic and polical organizaon of society) Prevalence and presence in treatment in society / other ethnic groups - Integraon policies - Recepon policies - Top-down ethnic organizaon - Urban organizaon - Etc. - Structural discriminaon - Treatment accessibility - General health policy - Etc. potenal explanatory intersecons - - - potenal pathways in explanatory mechanisms for the studied social outcome (e.g. high prevalence and / or low presence in treatment) potenal explanatory ethnic boundary making mechanisms for the studied social outcome By proposing the inclusion of these research perspectives, and applying such methodology and research framework, we recognise that normative and ontological presuppositions will affect the actual impact of research, particularly in policy- oriented research. We thus take on what Lather (2007) calls ‘‘doubled research’’: we work both with and against ethnic categories, we challenge and accept ethnic categories to move towards social transformation. Concluding remarks Epidemiological research offers insights into substance pref- erence, prevalence and methods of use in specific migrants and ethnic minority groups. Nevertheless, most of this research remains problem in that (1) its basic assumption is a distinction between ethnic groups, (2) it subordinates non- ethnic factors to ethnic factors by means of the proper research unit and (3) it is based in methodological individu- alism, subordinating structural and contextual factors such as structural and perceived discrimination. The study of problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities could benefit from an analysis of the production and reconstruction of ethnic boundaries (Martiniello, 2013; Wimmer, 2013; Barth, 1969/ 1998) at the individual, community and structural level. It is important to combine the intersectional analysis of non-ethnic factors and mechanisms with distinguishing ethnic processes from individual and other processes, and to focus on structural DOI: 10.1080/09687637.2016.1239696 Studying ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment 7 constraints (such as structural and perceived discrimination) in eco-social or socio-cultural research frameworks. We recognise that the category of ethnicity has been debated extensively in anthropology and sociology, but the outcomes of these debates have only rarely permeated epidemiological research designs for studying problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. It has become imperative to translate the subordinate impact of belonging to an ethnic group and being identified as such within a certain society, into comprehensive research designs that recognise the situational, historically embedded and performative nature of ethnicity. We argue for holistic research designs that include the sites of the individual, the communal and the structural, the product and discourses of these entities, and their construction through social relations, experiences, subjective interpretations, identity formation processes and structural constraints. This implies that quantitative epidemi- ology could benefit from (1) including other variables than ethnic (e.g. generation, neighbourhood, socio-economic status, gender, etc.) and counterbalancing them against the ethnic variables and mechanisms by means of intersectional methods, (2) applying holistic (e.g. eco-social or socio-cultural) research designs, (3) using mixed-method research (both quantitative and qualitative), and (4) moving away from methodological individualism towards mechanism-based social theory, includ- ing research questions on how social outcomes (disparities in prevalence rates or treatment) come about, in which contexts and under which (micro, meso and macro) circumstances. In conclusion, we have argued that carrying out research into ethnicity involves researching the construction of differ- ence. Moreover, researchers should consider how to influence social imbalances. What questions and which frameworks will generate which new social outcomes? The fact that migrants and ethnic minorities persistently suffer perceived and structural discrimination by no means justifies the unique use of the ‘‘ethnic’’ category as the sole unit of analysis. It is, on the contrary, of vital importance that we radically choose to deconstruct ethnic categories and focus on how to challenge social disparities by the rigorous choice of our research perspectives and designs.
