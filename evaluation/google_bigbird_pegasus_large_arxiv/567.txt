ABSTRACT: 
At current mortality rates, life expectancy is most responsive to change in mortality rates at older ages. Mathematical formulas that describe the linkage between change in age-specific mortality rates and change in life expectancy reveal why. These formulas also shed light on how past progress against mortality has been translated into increases in life expectancy--and on the impact that future progress is likely to have. Furthermore, the mathematics can be adapted to study the effect of mortality change in heterogeneous populations in which those who die at some age would, if saved, have a different life expectancy than those who live.

HOW CHANGE IN AGE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY AFFECTS LIFT EXPECTANCY J W. Vaupel r n D U C T I O N Suppose the goal is to increase the life expectancy of a population. Or, equivalently, assume the objective is to save as many life years as possible. If 100 deaths could be averted in any decade of life--0 to 10, say, or 42 to 52--which decade would be best? The answer is simple--the first decade of life, because children lose the most years of life expectancy. Suppose, however, deaths could be reduced by one percent in any decade of life. Which decade would then be best? I t may seem reasonable, a t first thought, to guess 0 to 10, or 17 to 27, or some other young decade. Using the life table for Swedish males for 1982, how- ever, the correct answer is 67 to 77. And using the life table for Swedish fe- males for 1982 the answer is 74 to 84. The Swedish life table indicates that out of a synthetic cohort of 100,000 women, 13 girls would die between their tenth and eleventh birthdays. Life ex- pectancy a t age 10.5 is about 69.5 years. The product approximates the number of years of life expectancy lost-just over 900 life years. At age 80, more than 3600 women die, losing 7.7 years of life expectancy. The product gives 28,000 life years. More than thirty times as many years of life expectancy are lost a t age 80 than a t age 10. Large numbers of life years are lost in infancy. In the Swedish female life table, 653 infants under age one die, losing about 79.2 years of life expectancy each., or about 52 thousand years all together. But only 189 additional girls die between ages one and 10; the total loss of life expectancy between birth and age 10 is about 66 thousand years. Compared with these 842 deaths, nearly 32,000 women die in the decade between age 74 and 84. They lose about 8.3 years of life expectancy on average, or about 260 thousand years all together. Thus, four times as many years of life expectancy are lost in the decade between ages 74 and 84 as are lost in the first ten years of life. HOW REDUCXIONS IN MORTALITY INCREASE LlFE EXPECXANCY Let p ( a , t ) be the force of mortality a n d p ( a , t ) be the period survivorship at age a and time t ; p a n d p are interrelated by the familiar formulas: and 0 Let e (a , t ) represent period life expectancy, given by the well-known formula: where w is an age beyond which no one survives. Note that life expectancy a t birth is given by: 0 How does change in the trajectory of p affect e? Demographers have taken two basic approaches in answering this question. The first, exemplified by Pollard [I] and in a United Nations study [2], focuses on how the difference between two alternative trajectories--pl(a) and p2(a) , say--translates into the difference 0 1 0 2 between the resulting life expectancies, e and e . The second approach, pioneered by Keyfitz [3] and extended here, focuses on how the rate or intensity of progress in p. given by translates into the rate of progress in life expectancy, given by I t follows from (4) t ha t As shown by Keyfitz [3], if equal progress is being made against mortality a t all ages a t time t , i.e., p ( a , t ) = p ( t ) , all a . ( 8 ) then where Because H ( t ) can also be calculated by As discussed by Demetrius [4,5] and Keyfitz [3], H, which is a variant of the measure known as entropy o r information in o the r contexts, can be interpreted as a measure of t h e homogeneity of a population over age with respect t o mor- tality: if H equals zero, then everyone dies at t he same age; if H equals one, then the force of mortality is equal at all ages. As indicated by (9), H gives the percentage change in life expectancy produced by a one percent reduction in the force of mortality at all ages: if H i s 0.2, say, then a uniform one percent de- 0 crease in /I. would increase eo by 0.2 percent. As Keyfitz [6] further explains, "male mortality is clearly higher than female in most rich countries, usually by 0 50 percent or more a t typical ages. But eo is only about 10 percent greater for females .... The parameter H ... is intended to carry one from the 50 percent to the 10 percent". An alternative expression for H is revealing. I t follows from (7) that Substituting (3) and (4) yields Let so that q represents the total number of years of life expectancy lost by those who die a t age z, divided by life expectancy a t birth. Then Three special cases are of interest: i) If progress against mortality is uniform a t all ages, p (z , t ) = p(t ), all z , (17) then By comparing (9) and (18), i t is clear tha t H (which is, fittingly, the symbol for capital q ) is given by Substituting (15) yields Because t h e product of p and p gives the density of deaths a t age z, this formu- la helps reveal why H is a measure of the homogeneity of a population with re- gard to age of death (or lifespan). Furthermore, this formula facilitates under- standing of why H is a measure of the percentage increase in life expectancy generated by a one percent decrease in mortality rates. If a death is averted a t 0 age z , then e(z) years of life expectancy are gained. The numerator of (20) measures the total effect of reducing deaths a t all ages; the denominator con- verts the absolute effect into a relative effect. As suggested to me by my col- league Anatoli I. Yashin, this implies tha t H( t ) gives the proportional increase in life expectancy a t birth if everyone's first death were averted. The assump- tion is tha t each individual a t the hour of death is saved and given t h e life ex- pectancy of individuals surviving a t that; age. Thus, if H( t ) i.s 0.15, staying the hand of death once would increase life expectancy by 15 percent. Compared with (20), the expressions for H given in (10) and (12) seem less intuitive. ii) If progress against mortality only occurs between ages a and and if the rate of progress is uniform between these ages, then This formula was used to answer the question posed a t the s tar t of this paper. iii) Finally, if progress against mortality only occurs a t a single instantaneous age a, where 6 is a Dirac function, then Thus, ~ ( a ) is a measure of the potential for increasing life expectancy by reduc- ing the force of mortality a t age a . Because ~ ( a ) is proportional to p(a)p(a) 0 and e(a) , this potential depends both on the density of deaths a t age a and on the number of years of life expectancy lost by those dying a t age a. The implicit assumption is that the population is homogeneous a t any specific age: those who die would, if they could be saved, have the same life expectancy as those who live. This assumption will be relaxed later in this paper. THE POTENTIAL MIR SAVING LFE YENC3 2 +5 Table 1 presents values of q (a )dc for Swedish males and females in Z 1982*. After infancy, the maximum value of 9 for the men occurs a t age 72.5; for the women, it occurs a t age 60.0. A one percent reduction in the force of mortal- ity between ages 75 and 60 would increase male life expectancy by .036 percent and female life expectancy .031 percent. A one percent reduction in the force of mortality a t all ages would increase male life expectancy by about .15 per- cent and female life expectancy by about .13 percent. *A number of different life tables, from different sources, were used to make the calculation in this paper. The life tables for Sweden from 1780 to 1850 are from [7]; Swedish life tables after 1950, ex- cept for 1970 and 1982, are from the annual Swedish Statistical Yearbook. These various life tables are baaed on five years of data centered on the year given: the 1910 table, for example, is based on data from 1908 through 1912. The Swedish life tables for 1970 and 1982 were supplied by Professor Ingvar Holmberg of the University of Gothenberg: these tables pertain to a single gear of time. The U S , life table for 1918 is based on the advanced report of final mortality statistics in the Monthly Vi- tal Statistics Report, September 1882; the figures were adjusted by the correction factors given in that Report so that they are consistent with population estimates based on the 1880 census. The U.S. life table for 1970 is the decennial table based on data from 1969 through 1871, as published in "Unit- ed States l f e Tables: 196971" (National Center for Health Statistics, May 1975). The U.S. life table for ID00 is from [8]. The 1J.S. life tables for 1080 and 2000 are fromVLife Tables for t,he United States: 1800-205W', Actuarial Study No. 87, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, September 1982. All the remaining life tables pertaining to years between 1975 and 1879 are from the United Nations Demo- graphic Yearbook 1980. All other life tables are from [7]. 2 +5 Table 1.

Table 2 presents t h e answer for an assortment of countries a t different times with vary- ing life expectancies. The rough ru le of thumb is t h a t t h e optimal five year period is nea r t h e life expectancy of t he population: t he rule holds particularly well for populations with life expectancies of 65 years o r more. A simple model and some elementary calculus sheds some light on this finding. If t h e force of mortality follows a Gompertz curve, then i t follows from (15), (3) and (2) t h a t Setting the derivative of q ( a ) with respect to a equal to zero yields the result that the maximum value of q ( a ) occurs at the value of a such that For a Gompertz curve of mortality, this value of a turns out to be roughly equal to life expectancy a t birth.

This decline is, in large measure, a price of the progress that has been made in reducing deaths in infancy--the age at which the most years of life ex- pectancy are lost. Another result of this progress is a shift in the ages where further progress against mortality would be most effective in increasing life ex- pectancy. Before 1900, most of the potential for saving life years was concen- trated in the first five years of chj.ldhood; today, in developed countries, most of the potential is in old age. Table 3 shows the decline in H and the shift; in the profile of q by presenting data based on Swedish life tables from 1800 to 1980. Keyfitz [3] shows the decline in H for U.S. males and females from 1920 to 1960. As Pollard [I] demonstrates, more rapid progress against mortality may be occu.rring a t all ages in one population compared with another, but nonetheless life expectancy may be increasing less rapidly. This seeming paradox is less puzzling when viewed through t he lens of 7. Let pi(a) be the rate a t which the force of mortality is being reduced a t age a in population i. Suppose but that r l l (a )p l (a ) < rlz(a)p2(a), all a . Then i t follows from (16) that life expectancy will be increasing less rapidly in the first population than in the second. Table 3. The potential for saving life years (H), the proportion of this potential below age 5 and above age 65, and life expectancy a t birth for selected Swedish populations. Males Females NOTE: The life tables used before 1900 included no esti- mate of the force of mortality after age 85. For these W tables th.e value of Jq(+)dz was assumed to equal 85 7 q(r)dz. This approximation i s based o n the life 00 tables for which mortality rates are available after age 85. Clearly the condition in (28) can be relaxed; essentially what is required is that q l be sufficiently smaller than q2 at enough ages. As indicated in Table 3 and as discussed by Keyfitz [3], the value of H, the integral of the q ' s , tends to fall as life expectancy increases; as H falls, the value of q at most ages also must fall. Thus as life expectancy increases progress in reducing age-specific mortality translates into less and less progress in further increasing life expec- tancy. A population with a higher life expectancy than a second population can be making greater progress against mortality a t all ages but nonetheless be making less progress in increasing life expectancy. RATES OF PROGRESS AGAIN= MORTALITY The potential for saving life years is measured by q; progress against mor- tality is given by p. As indicated by (16), progress in increasing life expectancy, as measured by sr, depends on the product of q and p . Thus, even if the potential for saving life years is greatest in old age, if little progress is being made in reducing mortality a t older ages then this potential will not translate into life expectancy gains. Table 4 presents data on q and p for Swedish females in 1982. Progress in reducing mortality is highest in infancy and childhood; afterwards, the ann.ua1 rate of progress hovers between one and two percent or so a t most ages. Be- cause of the rapid ra te of progress in the childhood years, almost a sixth of the life expectancy gains occur before age 20 even though less than a tenth of the potential lies in these years. By age 55, however, potential and actual progress are in rough balance: seventy percent of the potential for saving life years oc- curs after age 55 and seventy percent of the actual improvement in. life expec- tancy can be attributed to progress made in reducing mortality after age 55. It may seem a bit surprising that progress in reducing mortality rates hovers around roughly the same level a t all ages after childhood and that significant improvements are being made at older ages. Table 5 presents data on trends in mortality rates since 1780 for Swedish females and males and since 1920 for U.S. females and males. In most cases, progressin reducing mortality after age 85 is comparable to the progress made between ages 5 and 65. Except for Swedish males, progress since 1950 and especially since 1970 against mor- tality in old age has been substantial. (For a discussion of recent U.S. mortality trends, see [9].) Table 4.

Suppose progress against mortality continues. Will. H decline much furth- er? Will life expectancy level off as it becomes more and more difficult t o in- crease life expectancy by decreasing mortality rates? Some insight into these questions can be gained by a simple model. Assume that the force of mortality can be described by a Gompertz curve, as given in (24). This is not an unrea- sonable assumption for our purposes here, given the low level of mortality in in- fancy and childhood in developed countries. Furthermore, because Table 5.

Values of eo and H over time, when the force of mortality follows a Gompertz curve and is being reduced one percent per year before age 85, for various assumptions about the rate of aging, B, and the rate of progress against mortality after age 85.

Table 6 projects life expectancy over a period of 300 years under various assumptions. The value of p in t h e Gompertz curve is taken to be e i ther .08 or .12--values roughly bracketing t h e values observed in developed countries. Pro- gress in reducing mortality before age 85 is assumed t o be one percent per year; af ter age 85, progress is e i ther one percent per year, half of percent per year, o r zero. Table 6 shows t h a t H does continue t o fall as life expectancy increases. When the re is no progress against mortality after age 85, H falls t o especially low levels and life expectancy does show some signs of leveling off--at a level well above 85. When mortality a t advanced ages is reduced by one percent per year, life expectancy increases t o a century or more. And even when t h e ra te of progress is only half a percent per year, life expectancy rises into t h e 90's. A r a t e of progress of one percent a year does not seem unreasonable in light of t h e s tat is t ics presented in Table 5 and given the ignorance and uncertainty en- veloping ou r understanding of aging processes [lo, 111. Indeed, a ra te of two percent per year might be plausible, in which case the 300 years in Table 6 would be r:ompressed in to a century and a half. Progress in increasing life expectancy is greater when 8, t h e rate of aging, is lower. This suggests that; reductions in p might be fa r more effective than reductions in a. If @ is c u t from .12 t o .08, t hen death ra tes a t all ages must be multiplied by a factor of nearly 14 before life expectancy re turns t o i t s original level. The da t a i n Table 6 indicate t h a t when progress against mortality is uni- form a t all ages, t hen the gain in life expectancy each century i s roughly the same--about 12.5 years when /3 = .08 and 8.4 years when @ = .12. Thus, although H, which measures t h e relative or proportional ra te of increase in life expec- 0 tancy, is decreasing, t h e absolute r a t e of increase, given by d e o / d t , seems t o remain more or less constant . The t ru th of this i s readily demonstrated. If mor- tali ty ra tes follow a Gompertz curve and if st.eady progress a t r a t e p is being made in reducing mortality rates , then '2 -a - P : ( e @ - l ) = J e 7 d z . 0 Elementary methods of differential calculus yield t h e resul t The first integral is simply t h e integral of t he density of death and hence equals one; the second integral equals life expectancy a t birth. Letting the result simplifies to If a' is small, which i t will be for a population with a long life expectancy (be- cause for such a population ei ther a will be small or pt will be large), t h e n the change in life expectancy over time will be roughly constant: THE IMPACT OF HEI'EXOGENE3TY The assumption is questionable t h a t those who die a t some age would, if saved, have the same life expectancy a s those who live. For instance, a s dis- cussed in [12], t h e victim of a serious hear t a t tack or motor vehicle accident might, if death were averted, be prone to another h e a r t a t tack o r motor vehicle accident. More generally, individuals of the same age may differ from each o ther in their "frailty" o r relative risk of death [13,14,15]. Let t h e life expectancy of those who a r e saved a t age a (i.e., t h e average number of years, under cu r ren t mortality conditions, t h a t these individuals would live if death could be averted) be denoted by e+(a) . In a homogeneous population, this life expectancy would 0 equal e ( a ) ; in a heterogeneous population i t will probably be lower, although it could, conceivably, be higher. Then, ( 1 5 ) becomes As before, 0 As a simple example, suppose e + were only half e a t all ages. The values of q and the value of H would be half a s great as the assumption of homogeneity would indicate. The profile of the q 's would be the same--and hence the age a t which there was the greatest potential for saving life years would not change-- but the impact of a one percent reduction in death rates on life expectancy would be cut in half. THE LIFE MPECTANCY OF THE DEAD More elaborately, following [ 1 3 ] , let z be a measure of frailty or relative risk such that an in&vidual a t some particular age with frailty z is subject to a force of mortality that is z times greater than the force of mortality of a "stan- dard" individual of the same age who has a frailty value of one. Then e + can be calculated if a distribution is specified for z . As noted by Beard [16] and others, the Gamma distribution is a plausible, tractable, and flexible probability distribution to use when studying heterogene- ous populations. Vaupel e t al. [ 1 3 ] prove tha t if z is Gamma distributed a t age a with shape parameter k and scale parameter A, then the frailty of those who die a t age a follows a Gamma distribution with the same scale parameter A and with shape parameter k + l . Consider the two cohorts of those who would ordinarily survive a t age a and those who would have died but are saved-and hence die later. If individual frailty does not change after age a , if Z ( z ) and ZC(z) are the mean frailties of the surviving members of the two cohorts a t age z > a , and if f i represents the force of mortality for the standard individual, then i t can be shown that Because. as shown in [13], the force of mortality among surviving individuals is given by the force of mortality among the survivors of the saved cohort will be If individual frailty is constant a t all ages after birth, then where a2 is the variance in frailty a t birth. Let s ( a . z ) represent the proportion of those alive a t age a who are surviving a t age z > a: Clearly, Consequently, the life expectancy of those whose death is averted at age a is given by: Indeed, (44) has a broader interpretation because of the remarkable result in (40): the force of mortality a t age z is th.e same for all the cohorts of survivors of those saved a t any age before z . Thus, (44) gives the life expectancy a t age a of the survivors of those whose death was averted a t any age before a.* *The formulas for 9 and e + in (40) and (44) readily generalize to cohorts for whom death is averted more than once, e.g., those who would die a t some age but are saved and then would die at some later age and are saved again. Far those who are saved rn times, substitute rn +$ for l+ue. Estimates of u2 are available from three studies. The eight estimates in [17] range from 0.25 to 1.67; the median is 0.37. The eight estimates in [la] range from .12 to .54; the median is .22. Finally, the parameters estimated in [19] imply a value of u2 of .22 for the model the fit the data best and a value of .03 for a model tha t fit less well. All these estimates a re based on data for elder- ly populations and on the assumption that individual frailty does not change with age and follows a Gamma distribution. Although the estimates are subject to question, i t seems plausible that an appropriate value of c? may be of the ord- e r of magnitude of 0.1 to 1.0 and that a best guess might be 0.25. Table '7 presents life expectancies for those who die a t various ages (if they were saved) and the corresponding values of 7, for five values of 9. When c? is zero, the population is homogeneous and the life expectancy of those who die is the same as the life expectancy of those who live. Note tha t the effect of hetero- geneity is to reduce life expectancy by a greater absolute amount a t younger ages but by a greater proportional amount at older ages. If, for example, u2 is one, then a t age zero the life expectancy of those who die is more than 7 years less, but still about 90% of, the life expectancy of those who survive. A t age 90, the loss is only 1.5 years, but this is nearly half of a ninety-year-old's life expec- tancy. I t is the proportional losses tha t affect 7 and H; consequently, the greater the heterogeneity, the lower the value of H and the more the potential for sav- ing lives lies a t younger ages. As the table shows, however, even i f u2 were as high as one, H would fall by less than a third, from .I27 to .091, and the poten- tial for saving life years by averting deaths above age 65 would only fall from 60 percent t o 54 percent of the total potential. A more general model of the life expectancy of those saved from death can be constructed as follows. Let &(z) represent the force of mortality at age z of those who would have died a t age a < z , perhaps from some specified cause, but were saved. Let the risk ratio be given by where ~ ( z ) is simply the force of mortality a t age z (i.e.. among those who would not have died). Then it follows from. (42) that Table 7.

For in- stance, ya(t ) could be constant for all t , could gradually decline toward one, or could be constant for a decade, say, and then fall to one. If then (47) implies The similarity of this formula to (44) means that the values in Table 7 for u2 equal to 0 to 4 can be interpreted as pertaining to 7, equal to 1 to 5. For exam- ple, consider a group of 50-year-olds who would have died from a heart attack but were saved. Suppose this group would face a force of mortality, for the rest of their lives, some five times greater than the normal force of mortality. Then their remaining life expectancy would be 18.0 years, rather than the normal 30.7 years. * POLTCY WUCATIONS AND INSINUATIONS As discussed by Vaupel [20], nearly all statistics presented in policy- relevant studies are really vectors: they not only summarize a body of data. but they also imply a policy thrust. lmplicational honesty requires some discussion of lurking insinuations that may appear to be simple facts. If mortality rates were reduced by one percent, over 60 percent of the life years gained would be gained by averting deaths above age 65. Does this imply that the life-saving efforts should be directed toward the elderly population? Not necessarily, for several reasons. First, the 60 percent figure is based on the 1982 life table for Swedish females. For males and for other countries the figure is generally *The 40 formulas given in this paper can be readily generalized to specific causes of death, in much the same way that [3] and [I] generalize their formulas. lower--for Swedish males in 1982 i t is under 50 percent. Heterogeneity, as dis- cussed above, would reduce this somewhat further. Second, the figure is based on a life table-i.e., on a hypothetical, station- ary population--rather than on the actual distribution of a population by age. In most populations there are more young people than implied by the life table. Consequently, the goal of increasing life expectancy is not completely congruent with the goal of saving as many life years as possible given the current population distribution. For instance, for the total U.S. life table for 1979, about 50 percent of the increase in life expectancy produced by a one per- cent reduction in mortality rates can be attributed to the reduction in mortali- ty rates above age 65. However, only about 36 percent of the gain in life years produced by a one percent reduction in the actual number of deaths a t all ages would be due to averting deaths above age 65. Third, the quality of life a t advanced ages may tend, on average, t o be lower than at younger ages. If the goal is to save as many quality-adjusted life years as possible [12], then efforts to avert deaths a t younger ages will appear more favorable. Other goals that might be proposed--e.g., maximize life years saved before the Biblical allotment of three score and ten, maximize economic pro- duction. minimize deaths of parents with young children, or minimize inequali- ties in lifespans--also favor efforts to reduce early deaths. Vaupel [21,22] ex- amines several criteria and concludes that most, of the losses due to death are due to deaths before age 65. Fourth, it may be easier to avert deaths before age 65 than afterwards. As the data presented on the rate of progress against mortality show, progress against early death has generally tended to be somewhat more rapid than pro- gress against death after age 65. Offsetting these considerations are many others. As Vaupel and Yashin [14] suggest, the t rue rate of progress being made in reducing mortality rates a t ad- vanced ages may be masked by the effects of heterogeneity. The quality of life of many of those who die before age 65 may be relatively low, even if the quality of life a t younger ages does tend to be higher than that after, say, age 85. Further- more, those who die early may tend to be the kind of people who, if saved, would have relatively short life expectancies. Finally, there are several appealing ob- jectives that favor life saving at older ages. I t is desirable to avert death per se, regardless of life expectancy, and m.ost deaths occur in old age. It is desirable t o have a society that is diverse in its age composition--and in its memories and experiences. Persons born in the 19th century, who experienced the world with Kaiser Franz Joseph and without radio, are not only relatively r a r e but also con- s t i tute , in a sense, a n endangered species tha t will be extinct in a few years. Suppose i t were possible to save the lives of t en BO-year-olds, giving them, on average, seven additional years of life. And suppose the alternative was to save t h e lives of two 40-year-olds, giving each of them an expected additional li- fespan of 35 years. Either way, 70 years of life expectancy a re gained. Which al- ternative would be preferable? Recommendations concerning t h e focus of poli- cies to save lives depend not only on statistical analyses but also on answers to such difficult value questions. Beyond this, policy decisions are usually made concerning specific lifesav- ing alternatives. Should an extra million dollars be devoted t o research on influenza? Should passive restraint systems for automobiles be required? These decisions depend not only on broad value judgments but also on t h e details of the specific proposal. How effective is i t likely to be? How much will i t cost? How many voters will like it? Nonetheless, t he methods and findings of this paper may be of some relevance to policy discussions. In particular, there is considerable potential for saving life years and increasing life expectancy by reducing mortality in old age, more potential than generally realized. Furthermore, because consider- able progress is being made in reducing mortality among the elderly, this poten- tial is being realized. The result is a shift in the age composition of t h e popula- tion: progress in reducing mortality ra tes is adding relatively few life years among t h e working-age population compared with t h e extra life years added af ter age 65.
