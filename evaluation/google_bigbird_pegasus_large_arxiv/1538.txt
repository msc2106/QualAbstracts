ABSTRACT: 
Legislative scholars have a history of stepping back occasionally to examine the development and state of the sub-discipline (Budge 1973; Gamm and Huber 2002; Loewenberg, Patterson, and Jewell 1985; Mezey 1993; Morris-Jones 1983; Pasquino 1973; Patterson 1989). Many of these existing reviews, although valuable, are predominantly of a qualitative and subjective nature and are, in most cases, now dated. This paper provides a bibliometrical analysis of the state of legislative studies in the United States and Europe by exploring the content of eight political science journals. I looked at six general political science journals, three originating in the United States and three in Europe, as well as the content of two legislative studies journals—the American-based Legislative Studies Quarterly and the British-based Journal of Legislative Studies.

FULL TEXT: 
 Two Houses: Legislative Studies and theAtlantic DivideShane Martin, Dublin City UniversityL egislative scholars have a history ofstepping back occasionally to examinethe development and state of the sub-discipline ~Budge 1973; Gamm andHuber 2002; Loewenberg, Patterson, andJewell 1985; Mezey 1993; Morris-Jones1983; Pasquino 1973; Patterson 1989!.Many of these existing reviews, althoughvaluable, are predominantly of a qualita-tive and subjective nature and are, inmost cases, now dated. This paper pro-vides a bibliometrical analysis of thestate of legislative studies in the UnitedStates and Europe by exploring the con-tent of eight political science journals.1 Ilooked at six general political sciencejournals, three originating in the UnitedStates and three in Europe, as well asthe content of two legislative studiesjournals—the American-based LegislativeStudies Quarterly and the British-basedJournal of Legislative Studies.It is generally agreed that politicalscience lacks a common underlying theo-retical outlook and agenda for research~Garand 2005!. Scholarship emergingfrom North American and Europe is gen-erally seen as having two very distinct“styles”—the former being focused ontheoretical rigor and empirical data col-lection and analysis with the latter con-centrating on more descriptive accountsof political behavior.2 For the majority ofthe North American community, politicalscience is an empirical social science,while in Europe, political science, or thesubject commonly referred to as politics,is more closely tied to its historical rootsin philosophy or constitutional and ad-ministrative law. I explore here the de-gree to which such a divide exists todayin legislative studies. Given the signifi-cant role that some consider legislativestudies to play in shaping the wider dis-cipline ~Shepsle 2002!, this analysis willbe of interest to political scientists re-gardless of their particular research andteaching focus.The novelty of this article is twofold:I provide a detailed bibliometric exami-nation of the state of legislative scholar-ship in the United States and Europe andinvestigate and comment upon the simi-larities and differences between legisla-tive scholarship in the two regions. Iexplore questions as to the relativeamount of output, the country and insti-tution being analyzed, the subject matter,and the methodology employed. In addi-tion, I use data on the level of inter-regional collaboration, as measuredthrough co-authorship patterns, to pro-vide further insight into the recent evolu-tion of the discipline and the strength ofthe divide.Data and MethodsBibliometrics relies on the quantitativeanalysis of published works. Publicationsare important because they spread scien-tific findings. Legislative scholars, likepolitical scientists in general, rely on awhole range of publication channels in-cluding conference papers, monographs,books, and journal articles. This paperfocuses on one single unit of researchoutput, namely journal articles. Journalsare the primary forum to convey cuttingedge research within the profession. Iexcluded books, despite the obvious factthat they contain many important insightsand are important mechanisms for com-municating research. Ideally, a bibliomet-ric analysis of a discipline requires oneto look at all forms of publication. Un-fortunately such a task is beyond thescope of this paper.I selected six general political sciencejournals for content analysis. The threeU.S. general journals are the AmericanPolitical Science Review ~APSR!, one ofthe three journals of the American Politi-cal Science Association; the AmericanJournal of Political Science ~AJPS!, theofficial journal of the Midwest PoliticalScience Association; and the Journal ofPolitics ~JOP !, published in associationwith the Southern Political Science Asso-ciation. I selected these journals becausethey achieved the highest scores in thestudy by Garand and Giles ~2003! ofimpact rankings of political science jour-nals. Thus the APSR, AJPS, and JOP canbe considered the “top three” generaljournals in the United States. Selectingthe “leading” European journals provesmore elusive given the absence of anypan-European journal rankings. Anappropriate proxy is the rankings ofEuropean journals by British politicalscientists conducted by the British Politi-cal Studies Association ~Crewe and Nor-ris 1991!. Here, Political Studies ~PS!,the official journal of the Political Stud-ies Association, scores strongest on im-pact followed by the British Journal ofPolitical Science ~BJPS!, which is pub-lished independent of any professionalassociation by Cambridge UniversityPress. The third European journal for thisstudy, the European Journal of PoliticalResearch ~EJPR!, is included due to itsstatus as the official journal of the Euro-pean Consortium for Political Research~ECPR!, which makes it the most widelyrecognized general pan-European journalin the discipline.I include in this analysis two journalsof particular interest and importance tolegislative scholars: the U.S.-based Leg-islative Studies Quarterly ~LSQ! and theBritish-based Journal of LegislativeStudies ~JLS!. LSQ had always achievedhigh rankings and is considered one ofthe highest ranking specialty journals—perhaps itself an indication of the statusof legislative studies within the widerdiscipline.3 The slightly more youthfulJournal of Legislative Studies was firstpublished in 1995 and quickly estab-lished itself as a favored source for out-put among legislative scholars, includingmany of the leading scholars in thediscipline.I analyzed articles from each of theeight journals journal over the period1995–2006. I defined articles as substan-tive papers and I only included researcharticles or “other articles” that I considerto have substantive original research.Typically I excluded editor’s notes, de-bates, comments, communications, re-plies and responses, and rejoinders andcounter-rejoinders. In total, I analyzedthe titles and abstracts of 2,687 articles tosee if they were connected to legislativestudies and were research substantive. OfShane Martin lectures in comparativepolitics at Dublin City University. He is co-founder of the ECPR Standing Group onParliaments. In the United States, he haspreviously taught at the Pennsylvania StateUniversity and the University of California,San Diego. His research focuses on roleorientation and the electoral connection.PSOnline www.apsanet.org doi:10.1017/S104909650808075X 557these articles, I found 887 that consti-tuted legislative research. The Appendixprovides a detailed description of how Idemarcated legislative and non-legislativeresearch. I further reviewed each of thesearticles and the content recorded for anal-ysis. I discuss the questions and findingsfrom the content analysis below.FindingsMethodologyA key feature of a unified disciplineis a common methodological approachbased on an underlying paradigm. How-ever, there appears to be no such under-lying paradigm within legislative studies.Table 1 shows the differences in method-ological orientation between legislativestudies papers in the select U.S. and Eu-ropean journals. I coded each articlebased on five different characterizationsof methodology ranging from purely for-mal modeling with no empirics to purelyempirical work ~data presentation!. I fur-ther differentiated between qualitative~case study! and quantitative ~large-Nstatistical! work. In general, the resultsare in keeping with the findings of Nor-ris ~1997!, who analyzed a sample ofarticles in three political science journals.She found PS tends to be heavilyweighted towards philosophical anddescriptive0institutional methods. TheAPSR tends towards more empiricalmethods and rational choice0deductiveapproaches. We can see that in the caseof legislative studies this difference inmethodological style is exacerbated. Leg-islative articles published in the threeU.S. journals are far more likely to con-tain deductive theory, make use of math-ematical reasoning, or be large-Nquantitative. While a significant propor-tion of the European journal articles arequantitative, the thick descriptive ap-proach is still frequently employed withpurely theoretical works relatively rare.Based on the data in Table 1, it seemsreasonable to conclude that the differencein theoretical orientation between U.S.and European legislative scholarship is aprime example of what King, Keohane,and Verba ~1994, 4! described as “thebifurcation of the social sciences into aquantitative-systematic-generalizingbranch and a qualitative-humanistic-discursive branch.” European scholarstend to rely on inductive and descriptivemethods of inquiry while Americanscholars focus more on quantitative anal-ysis of a priori theoretical reasoning, orin some cases on purely deductive rea-soning without empirical tests. It shouldbe noted however that some of the gen-eral European journals and the JLS dopublish work comprising of formalsmodels and0or formal models with someempirical test.If scholars seek to export or importthe dominant paradigms and methodol-ogy of American legislative scholarship,they must deal with issues of environ-mental and institutional sensitivity, orwhat Mezey ~1991! refers to as “takingthe legislature out of context.” All na-tional assemblies share something incommon, but there are many importantdifferences. Indeed, American exception-alism may well be responsible for thelack of cross-regional integration in leg-islative studies. Applying a congressionalmodel unaltered to a parliament in an-other country may be problematic for anumber of reasons. Even if we assumethat legislators are goal oriented ~an al-most unquestioned assumption in Ameri-can scholarship!, can we assume that there-election goals of members of Con-gress are the same as members of a leg-islature operating under parliamentarismwho may have their eyes on promotionrather than re-election? For example, in agroundbreaking paper, Strøm ~1997! ar-gues that legislators in some countriesmust focus on reselection, re-election,and promotion to higher political office.We must not neglect the occasionallylively debate within the U.S. on the sta-tus of theory and in particular the anti-rational choice movement, symbolized bythe publication some years ago of Pa-thologies of Rational Choice Theory~Green and Shapiro 1994!. More re-cently, the emergence and influence ofthe Perestroika movement in the U.S. hassought to make American political sci-ence, which legislative studies is un-doubtedly a significant part of, moremethodologically plural ~Monroe 2005!.And even within the family of positivepolitical economy we need to be awareof internal divisions, particularly in thepresence of divergent theories with simi-lar empirical predictions ~Shepsle andWeingast 1995!.Even if European legislative scholar-ship is weak in theoretical orientation itis even weaker when it comes to theexistence of empirical data on Europeanlegislatures. Many Congressional schol-ars who interact with European col-leagues are rightly amused, not just atthe atheoretical state of comparativeresearch but at the absence of harddata of even the most rudimentary typefor many parliaments. While scholarshave built up collections of data onsome parliaments, none come close tothe quality and amount of data on theU.S. Congress. Moreover, the amount ofTable 1Primary Methodology of Legislative Studies Articles as a Percent of all Legislative StudiesArticlesMethodologyAPSR,AJPS, JOPPS,BJPS, EJPR LSQ JLS AllData Presentation, no theory 1.3 18.7 2.2 0.0 2.3Non-formal, non-quantitative theoretical 2.5 15.0 11.1 77.2 33.2Informal theoretical model, quantitative empirics 80.6 54.5 76.7 19.8 56.2Formal model with quantitative empirics 5.3 10.6 6.7 2.2 4.7Formal theoretical model, no-empirics 10.2 1.2 3.3 0.9 3.699.9 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0Note: Total may not add up to 100 due to rounding.APSR = American Political Science Review BJPS = British Journal of Political ScienceAJPS = American Journal of Political Science EJPR = European Journal of Political ResearchJOP = Journal of Politics LSQ = Legislative Studies QuarterlyPS = Political Studies JLS = The Journal of Legislative Studies558 PS July 2008cross-institutional data is very limited.One can look to examples such as thestudy of western European legislaturesheaded by Herbert Döring ~1995!, buteven here the data provide a snapshot ata particular period of time rather than atemporal perspective.Finally, it should be noted that just asa discipline or sub-discipline evolves, sotoo will the study of an individual legis-lature. A graduate student who decides tostudy a legislature that has remained rel-atively unexplored ~and as we will dis-cuss below, many such legislatures exist!may find it difficult to do anything butthe most elementary of storytelling, par-ticularly at the initial research stages.The study of any individual legislaturebegins with a large amount of observa-tion and reporting of elementary facts.This may explain in part why so manyarticles in European journals, which aremore likely to be focused on understud-ied legislatures, are of the descriptive,non-quantitative type. It may also helpexplain the unwillingness of U.S.-basedscholars to study under-researched Euro-pean legislatures, as the starting point forsuch research is likely to include expen-sive and time consuming information anddata collecting fieldwork. Data on Amer-ican politics is likely to be more readilyavailable and even machine readable.Publication RatesTable 2 reports the rate of legislativestudies articles to total articles in theeight journals over the period 1995–2006. Overall, legislative research ac-counts for just less than 35% of allresearch, although this number is mis-leading given the inclusion of two spe-cialist journals. In the six generalpolitical science journals, just less than15% of all articles relate to legislatures.Although this percentage may at firstappear low, it is perhaps surprisinglylarge when we remember how diversethe research interests of the political sci-ence community have become.4When I examined the distribution oflegislative studies article by journal, thetrends were striking. The three U.S. jour-nals published 233 legislative studiesarticles, which equates to just under 80%of legislative articles in all six generaljournals. By itself, the AJPS accounts forover a third of all legislative studies arti-cles in the six journals. In contrast, thenumber of legislative studies articles ineach of the three general European jour-nals is in double rather than triple digits.I should note that for the period underreview the total number of articles is lessin the three European journals than in theU.S. general journals ~over the period theU.S. journals accounted for 64% of arti-cles in the six general journals!. Tocontrol for different overall output, Icompared the ratio of legislative studiesarticles to non-legislative studies articlesin each journal. When I took the rate oflegislative studies articles to total outputthe figures did not change dramatically:21% of AJPS articles, 20% of JOP arti-cles, and 11% of APSR articles are legis-lative related. While 15% of the BJPScan be categorized as legislative studies,the EJPR includes less than 8% legisla-tive studies. PS makes the lowest contri-bution to legislative output in any of thejournals reviewed, with less that 5% ofits content being legislative scholarship.Overall, the picture is relatively clear: ofthe six general journals reviewed, thethree U.S. publications account for some80% of legislative studies articles. Evenwhen the rate of article production istaken into account, one is twice as likelyto see a legislative studies article in anAmerican journal than in a Europeanjournal—just under 9% of all articles inthe three general European journals arelegislative studies, compared with nearly18% in the three leading American jour-nals. The only outlier is the BJPS, whichpublished significantly more legislativescholarship than the other two Europeanjournals.Including articles from the two spe-cialist journals slightly decreases theoverall difference between Europe andthe United States legislative studies out-put as the JLS published slightly morearticles than LSQ during the periodunder review. Nevertheless, a huge gapstill exists between the amount and rateof legislative studies being published inthe two regions.Country/Institution FocusTo explore further the possibility ofregional imbalance, I examined the coun-try focus of research. The results are inTable 3 for research focused on onecountry and in Table 4 for multi-countrylegislative research.The figures are striking in that theyprovide further evidence of Americandominance in legislative studies. Some426 articles have been published on leg-islatures in the United States ~either theUnited States Congress, state, or locallegislatures!. Indeed legislative politics inAmerica is the focus of just under half ofall published research in the eight jour-nals. The next most studied legislature isthat of the United Kingdom, with thevast majority on the House of Commons.The European parliament scores nexthighest, which, despite its short lifetime~it was first popularly elected in 1979!,has caught the attention of American andEuropean scholars alike. Thereafter, theparliaments of other countries individu-ally account for less than 2% of legisla-tive research. The focus on Americanlegislatures is even more unequivocal inAmerican journals with over two-thirdsof legislative studies articles in the topthree journals focusing on United Stateslegislatures and over 80% of articles inLSQ focusing on the United States.Overall, Table 3 points to an extraordi-nary, if not surprising, imbalance interms of which countries are the subjectof study by legislative scholars.One of the most interesting points toemerge from Table 4, which reports thecountry focus of multi-country studies, isthe relatively low rate of cross-nationalcomparative research in legislative stud-ies. Just 12% of legislative studiesTable 2Legislative Studies Articles in Eight Political Science JournalsJournal NumberPercent ofTotal ArticlesAmerican Political Science Review (APSR) 56 11.5American Journal of Political Science (AJPS) 95 21.5Journal of Politics (JOP ) 82 20.2General American journals combined 233 17.8Political Studies (PS) 14 4.5British Journal of Political Science (BJPS) 27 14.8European Journal of Political Research (EJPR) 19 7.3General European journals combined 60 8.9Legislative Studies Quarterly (LSQ) 270 100.0Journal of Legislative Studies (JLS) 324 98.8All eight journals 887 34.8PSOnline www.apsanet.org 559articles are ~cross-country! comparative,with 85% of legislative studies articlesfocusing on one country.5 The most com-mon form of comparative legislativestudies involves examining the parlia-ments of three or more European coun-tries. In the articles I reviewed, the U.S.Congress has only been compared ahandful of times to parliaments in othercountries, and all of these are English-speaking countries with the exception ofGermany, Japan, and the multilingualEuropean Parliament.In Table 5 I report the specific legisla-tures that scholars are studying in eachcountry. Looking at all eight journals, theU.S. House of Representatives accountsfor a quarter of all legislative studiesresearch, nearly equaling all research onlower or unicameral chambers in allother countries combined. A noteworthyfinding is that research on the House issignificantly greater than on the UnitedStates Senate by a margin of four to one.This surely has huge significance for thestudy of American politics, and it is alittle difficult to explain given the impor-tance and significance of the Senate inAmerican politics.I also observed a significant differencein which journals publish articles onwhich institutions. While a plurality ofarticles published in U.S. journals are onthe U.S. House of Representatives, a dif-ferent picture emerges in the four Euro-pean journals where for both the threegeneral journals and JLS, almost half ofarticles are published on the lower orunicameral chamber of a national legisla-ture of a country other than the UnitedStates. The focus on lower chambers out-side America is less surprising, given thepresence of unicameral systems and thegeneral dominance of the lower chamberover the upper chamber in many politicalsystems.In summary, I see relatively clearpatterns of research, with little cross-national research and a relative abun-dance of research on Americanlegislative institutions in general and theHouse of Representatives in particular.Subject MatterParliaments are complex institutionsmade even more complex by their inter-action with other parts of the politicalsystem. What exactly then is it aboutlegislatures that scholars study? To helpanswer this question, I identified the pri-mary subject matter of each article andthe categorization and findings are inTable 6.The interaction between the executiveand legislature is a significant subject inpublished research in legislative studies.Table 3Focus of Single Country Studies as a Percent of LegislativeStudies ArticlesCountry/InstitutionAPSR,AJPS, JOPPS,BJPS, EJPR LSQ JLS AllUnited States 76.0 11.7 81.5 6.8 48.0United Kingdom 0.0 25.0 0.7 24.4 10.8European Parliament 0.4 10.0 1.1 9.3 4.5Italy 1.3 8.3 0.4 2.8 2.0Germany 1.3 3.3 0.4 3.1 1.8Brazil 1.3 0.0 3.0 0.6 1.5Russia 0.9 0.0 1.5 2.2 1.5Canada 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.4 1.2Japan 1.3 1.7 0.4 0.9 0.9Australia 0.9 1.7 0.4 0.9 0.8Denmark 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.2 0.8Israel 0.0 0.0 0.7 1.5 0.8Norway 0.4 1.7 0.0 1.5 0.8France 0.0 3.3 0.0 1.2 0.7Netherlands 0.0 1.7 0.4 1.2 0.7Argentina 0.9 0.0 0.0 0.9 0.6Spain 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.5 0.6Hungary 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.9 0.5Ireland 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.2 0.5New Zealand 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.2 0.5Portugal 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.2 0.5Bangladesh 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.6 0.3China 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.6 0.3Colombia 0.9 0.0 0.4 0.0 0.3Czech Republic 0.0 0.0 0.7 0.3 0.3Finland 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.9 0.3Iceland 0.0 1.7 0.0 0.6 0.3Ukraine 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.6 0.3Belgium 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.2India 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.2Korea 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.2Mexico 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.3 0.2Poland 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.2Sweden 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.2Trinidad and Tobago 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.2Bulgaria 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Chile 0.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1Estonia 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Greece 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Honduras 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Kosovo 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Mongolia 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Morocco 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Nepal 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Singapore 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.0 0.1Slovakia 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1South Africa 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Taiwan 0.0 0.0 0.4 0.0 0.1Turkey 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Uruguay 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Zambia 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.1Total 85.8 70.0 94.1 80.9 85.5Note: Total does not add up to 100 because of the exclusion of multi-country arti-cles (see table 4 below) and non-empirical articles.APSR = American Political Science Review BJPS = British Journal of Political ScienceAJPS = American Journal of PoliticalScienceEJPR = European Journal of PoliticalResearchJOP = Journal of Politics LSQ = Legislative Studies QuarterlyPS = Political Studies JLS = The Journal of Legislative Studies560 PS July 2008This is not surprising given the impor-tance of the separation of branches in themost studied country ~the United States!and the key role of the executive in thepolitical life of parliamentary democra-cies. Legislative-executive relations ac-count for just over 11% of legislativestudies articles in the general U.S. jour-nals and close to 17% of legislative stud-ies articles in the three general Europeanjournals. In European parliamentary sys-tems, the executive comes from and re-mains accountable to, but also frequentlydominates, the legislature, which mayprompt European scholars to be morefocused on executive-legislative relationsand less interested in topics such as theinternal organization of parliaments.The single largest legislative studiestopic dealt with by American journals isthe electoral responsiveness of members.This accounts for close to 15% of arti-cles in the three U.S. journals. Researchon responsiveness is dramatically less inthe European journals, accounting forless than 2% of legislative research.Other subjects that receive a significantamount of attention in the general U.S.journals include internal procedures,committees, minority and gender repre-sentation, and research seeking to explainthe voting behavior of members.

Fi-nally, the category “other” accounts for2% of articles, many of which deal withpublic perception of members and theinstitution. Exploring the specialist jour-nals, both publish a significant propor-tion of research on organizationalstructures and committees, with theLSQ publishing significantly moreon voting patterns, candidates andincumbency, and electoral responsivenessthan the JLS. The JLS in turn publishessignificantly more on legislative-executive relations ~more than twice asmuch as LSQ!, bicameralism, and therole of national parliaments in what isnow the European Union.The above patterns notwithstanding,it is in terms of subject matter thatlegislative studies seems least divided.A great deal of eclecticism in legislativescholarship exists in both the UnitedStates and Europe, although some sub-jects are certainly more studied thanothers, overall and when I contrastedoutput from journals on different sidesof the Atlantic. It is also worth notingthat, for the three general Europeanjournals, the focus on coalition theorymay overestimate the true level oflegislative studies, given that, as men-tioned in the section on demarcatinglegislative studies, some considertheories of government formationto be outside the realm of legislativestudies.Authorship and CollaborationIf most legislative scholarship is pub-lished in American journals and aboutAmerican legislatures, one of the lasthopes for a unified sub-discipline is thepresence of cross-regional authorship andcollaboration. Table 7 reports the distri-bution of authorship by country of insti-tutional affiliation for each author ofeach article.6 As one might expect, it ismostly American scholars who publishlegislative studies articles in Americanjournals and mostly European scholarswho publish legislative studies articlesin European journals. The exception isthe BJPS where over half of all legisla-tive studies articles are published byAmerican-based academics. This trend isalso present, to a lesser degree, in thethree other European journals. Overall,an American-based scholar is far morelikely to publish a legislative studies arti-cle in a European journal than aEuropean-based academic is likely topublish a legislative studies article in anAmerican journal. This finding suggeststhat the data already presented in thispaper overestimates the significance oflegislative studies in Europe, given that asignificant proportion of European legis-lative scholarship originates not in Eu-rope but in the United States.A key indicator of the internationaliza-tion of a discipline is the extent to whichresearchers from different countries worktogether. Correspondingly, the degree ofnon-collaborative research or intra-regional research can be taken as ameasure of the regionalization of a disci-pline. The most obvious indicator of col-laboration is joint or multiple signings ofresearch articles.7 While not all collabo-rative projects get to the publicationstage, we can most easily measure coop-eration patterns that result in journalarticles.Tables 8 and 9 report the co-authorship patterns for legislative studiesarticles based on the author’s country ofresidence. The pattern is one of little in-terregional collaboration. Scholars withinthe same region conduct the vast bulk ofresearch, either in single or intraregionalcollaboration. American collaboratorsco-authored 247 articles in the four U.S.journals ~Table 8!, while 32 articles werepublished in the four European journalsby all-American teams ~Table 9!.

In Europeanjournals, the rate of American-Europeancollaboration is only slightly higher withthe equivalent of 10 papers emergingfrom cross-Atlantic collaboration. Euro-peans are less likely to collaborate witheach other than Americans with otherAmericans ~reflecting the dominance ofAmerican authors!, but are still morelikely to collaborate with each other thanwith Americans. Overall, the lack of in-terregional collaboration and the pres-ence of significantly more intraregionalresearch teams provide further evidenceof a division between legislative studiesin the United States and Europe.ConclusionI used bibliometric data from eight ofthe leading journals in the discipline toshed light on the state of legislative stud-ies as a sub-discipline. These data high-light the major differences betweenEuropean and North American legislativescholarship. The analysis shows that adisproportionate amount of journal spaceis given to reporting research on the U.S.Congress, particularly the House of Rep-resentatives, while there is a dearth ofreported research on other legislatures inmy sample. General American journalspublish a disproportionate share of alllegislative scholarship compared withgeneral European journals. The contentanalysis of articles points to the absenceof a unified methodological approach tostudying legislatures. With regard to thespecific subject matter, U.S. scholars aremore interested in electoral responsive-ness while a significant proportion oflegislative studies published in the sam-ple of European journals focuses onexecutive-legislative relations. The pat-tern of authorship shows that American-based scholars contribute a significantproportion of legislative scholarship thatis published in European journals whileEuropeans rarely publish legislativescholarship in American journals. Theexistence of the Atlantic divide is per-haps most evident when we consider theminiscule levels of interregional collabo-ration between scholars from the twocontinents—legislative scholars are farmore likely to collaborate with scholarsfrom the same side of the Atlantic. Over-all then, the analysis of published articlesidentifies a clear divide between Euro-pean and North American legislativescholarship.This article has shed some light on thestate and recent development of legisla-tive studies in the United States and Eu-rope. Is the observed divide a good orbad thing? It could be argued that multi-ple paradigms existing side by side are aTable 7Distribution of Authorship by Country of Institutional Affiliationas a Percent of all Legislative Studies ArticlesAPSR AJPS JOP LSQ PS BJPS EJPR JLSUnited States 96.4 97.9 96.3 94.1 17.9 51.2 28.9 24.7Canada 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.6 0.0 11.1 7.9 3.2South America 0.0 0.3 0.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.7United Kingdomand Ireland0.9 0.5 0.6 1.3 67.9 23.5 7.9 41.2Rest of Europe 0.9 0.0 0.0 2.5 7.1 12.3 52.6 23.3Rest of World 1.8 0.8 3.0 1.1 7.1 1.9 2.6 5.9Total 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100Note: Each unit represents a journal article.

Ifso, it is up to this generation of scholarsto bridge the divide. A less negative viewof the Atlantic divide would emphasizethe contribution of different houses ofresearch to methodological and substan-tive pluralism in legislative studies. Pro-ponents of this view would surely be lessthan pleased at any attempt to unify leg-islative studies. A next step may be toattempt an understanding of the cause ofthe divide. This task, with all the politi-cal baggage of divided disciplines, mayprove somewhat more difficult.At a more practical level we can pro-mote efforts to bridge the research gapbetween European and American legisla-tive studies. More European scholars arepaying more attention to parliaments andmore American scholars are engagingwith legislatures outside their own juris-dictions. Unifying legislative studies re-quires making American and Europeanscholars more interested in, and morewilling to do research on, European leg-islative politics. It requires Europeanscholars to build on, and perhaps re-shape, the theoretical approaches to leg-islative scholarship in the United States.Professional groups such as the APSALegislative Studies Section and theECPR Standing Group on Parliamentscould work together to provide avenuesfor scholars to communicate with eachother and, potentially, collaborate. In-deed, the recent establishment of theECPR Standing Group on Parliamentsthat aims to encourage the promotion oflegislative scholarship on and within Eu-rope is a significant development. Panelsat the APSA Annual Meeting or theplanned ECPR Annual Summer Schoolon Parliaments could serve as a forum tobring together American and Europeanscholars to discuss the differences out-lined in this paper and think systemati-cally about opportunities to integrate andunify the field of legislative studies.Notes1.

Just 3% of articles have no empiricalfocus whatsoever.6. For co-authors from different countries,each country scores a fraction, depending on thenumber of authors. Thus, if a publication is co-authored by a person from the United Statesand a person from the United Kingdom, thenthe number of authors from the U.S. increasesby .5, as does the number of authors from theUK.7.

Consequently, the national parliament is a key political institution and is therefore frequently difficult, if notimpossible, to divorce from other political institutions.Take, for example, electoral systems and the study of elections. An electoral system provides the means to transformvotes into seats. When discussing the election of legislators, it seems obvious to think of electoral systems as a legitimatearea of interest to legislative scholars. Ballot structures not only determine the composition of the assembly, they may alsoshape the behavior and roles of members. Electoral-system research seems, however, to have developed as its own sub-discipline separate from legislative studies.Another field of research that may or may not be considered part of legislative scholarship is the study of governmentformation and survival. Coalition theorists seek to explain, among other things, which governments emerge under parlia-mentarism when no single party controls a majority of seats in the legislature. Empirically and theoretically, the unit ofanalysis is often the legislative party. If in parliamentary systems the making and breaking of governments, through thevote of investiture and vote of confidence mechanisms, is a key power of parliament then should it not be considered partof legislative studies? Alternatively, a case could be made for considering coalition theory as part of the sub field of politi-cal science focused on political parties.How then, should we demarcate legislative studies as a subfield? Is any aspect of politics that in some way involves thelegislature the legitimate concern of legislative scholars? As a discipline develops its members specialize. This is clearlywhat has happened in political science with the emergence of many, often distinctive, subfields.3 Given the possible criti-cism that too many boundaries exist in the discipline it may not be very useful to clarify them, although it is clearly neces-sary if we want to talk about the state of legislative studies as a field of research.4For the purpose of this study, legislative studies is defined as the behavioral and institutional study of parliamentary bod-ies and their interaction with other actors, taking account of the existence of other subfields in political science. For exam-ple, where research examined the interaction of parliamentary behavior and electoral systems (for example, the electoralresponsiveness of members), we take this research to be legislative studies. We exclude electoral studies that focus, for ex-ample, on voter behavior more generally. Similarly, government formation is considered an area of legislative scholarshipas is executive-legislative relations. It is worth emphasizing that I provide this definition with the aim of achieving somemethodological preciseness for our study rather than as an attempt to establish a commonly acceptable boundary.Notes1. Notwithstanding important differences in origin and meaning, I have used the terms legislature, parliament, and assembly interchangeablythroughout the paper.2. The idea that parliaments are weak institutions is prevalent, particularly in the literatureon non-American legislatures and can be traced tothe writings of Bryce on the decline of the British House of Commons (Bryce 1921). A glance at most country textbooks gives an indication of thecentrality of the national parliament with at least one chapter being dedicated to the institution.3. This is reflected, for example, in the fact that the American Political Science Association currently has 36 organized sections and the Euro-pean Consortium for Political research currently has 32 Standing Groups.4. One example is the failure of coalition theory to incorporate questions of interest to mainstream legislative scholars, such as the unitaryactor assumption of legislative parties, although see Giannetti and Benoit (2008) for recent work in this area.PSOnline www.apsanet.org 565
