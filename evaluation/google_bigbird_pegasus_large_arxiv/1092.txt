ABSTRACT: 
The GTZAN dataset appears in at least 100 published works, and is the most-used public dataset for evaluation in machine listening research for music genre recognition (MGR). Our recent work, however, shows GTZAN has several faults (repetitions, mislabelings, and distortions), which challenge the interpretability of any result derived using it. In this article, we disprove the claims that all MGR systems are affected in the same ways by these faults, and that the performances of MGR systems in GTZAN are still meaningfully comparable since they all face the same faults. We identify and analyze the contents of GTZAN, and provide a catalog of its faults. We review how GTZAN has been used in MGR research, and find few indications that its faults have been known and considered. Finally, we rigorously study the effects of its faults on evaluating five different MGR systems. The lesson is not to banish GTZAN, but to use it with consideration of its contents.Comment: 29 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, 128 reference.

 - view how GTZAN has been used in MGR research, and find few indications that its faults have been known and considered. Finally, we rigorously study the effects of its faults on evaluating five different MGR systems. The lesson is not to banish GTZAN, but to use it with consideration of its contents. 1 Introduction Our recent review of over 467 published works in music genre recognition (MGR) [1] shows that the most-used public dataset is GTZAN,1 appearing in the eval- uations of 100 works [2–101]. GTZAN is composed of 1,000 half-minute music audio excerpts singly labeled in ten categories [92, 93]; and though its use is so widespread, it has always been missing metadata identifying its contents. In fact, GTZAN was not expressly created for MGR,2 but its availability has made it a benchmark dataset, and thus a measuring stick for comparing MGR systems, ∗B. L.

Tzanetakis 1 ar X iv :1 30 6. 14 61 v2 [ cs .SD ] 7 J un 20 13 e.g., [102]. However, few researchers have ever listened to and critically evalu- ated the contents of GTZAN, and thus its faults remained undiscovered since its creation in 2002. Our previous work [103] provides the first metadata for GTZAN, and identifies several faults in its integrity: repetitions, mislabelings, and distortions. In that paper, however, we do not find the extent to which GTZAN appears in the liter- ature, and do not survey the ways in which it has been used. We do not measure how its faults affect evaluation in MGR; and, furthermore, we do not provide any recommendations for its future use. This article rigorously addresses all of these, significantly extending our analysis of GTZAN in several practical ways. Our work not only illuminates results reported by a significant amount of work, but also provides a critical piece to address the non-trivial problems associated with evaluating music machine listening systems in valid ways [1, 83,84,103–105]. As a brief menu of our main results, the most significant one is that we disprove the claims: “all MGR systems are affected in the same ways by the faults in GTZAN”, and “the performances of all MGR systems in GTZAN, working with the same data and faults, are still meaningfully comparable.” This shows that, for the 100 works performing evaluation in GTZAN [2–101], one cannot make any meaningful conclusion about which system is better than another for reproducing the labels of GTZAN, let alone which is even addressing the principal goals of MGR [105]. We find that of these 100 works, more appear in 2010 – 2012 than in the eight years after its creation. We find only five works (outside our own [83–86], and [99] which references [103]) that indicate someone has listened to some of GTZAN. Of these, one work explicitly endorses its integrity for MGR evaluation, while four allude to some problems. We find no work (outside our own [83–86]) that explicitly considers the musical content of GTZAN in evaluation. The lesson of this article is not that GTZAN should be banished, but that it must be used with consideration of its contents. Its faults, which are representative of data in the real-world, can in fact be used in the service of evaluation [84], no matter if it is MGR, or other music machine listening tasks. In the next subsection, we enumerate our contributions, and then explicitly state delimitations of this article. We then address several criticisms that have been raised in reviews of versions of this work. In the second section, we extend our previous analysis of GTZAN [103]. In the third section, we comprehensively survey how GTZAN has been used. In the fourth section, we test the effects of its faults on the evaluation of several categorically different and state-of-the-art MGR systems. Finally, we conclude by describing how GTZAN can be useful to future research. We make available on-line the MATLAB code to reproduce all results and figures, as well as the metadata for GTZAN: http://imi.aau.dk/~bst. 1.1 Contributions 1. We evaluate for several MGR systems the effects of the faults in GTZAN when evaluating performance, and falsify the claims: “all MGR systems are affected in the same ways by the faults in GTZAN”, and “the performances 2 of all MGR systems in GTZAN, working with the same data and faults, are still meaningfully comparable.” 2. We estimate upper bounds for several figures of merit for the “perfect” MGR system evaluated using GTZAN. 3. We significantly extend our prior analysis of GTZAN [103]: we create meta- data for 110 more excerpts; we devise an approach to analyze the composi- tion and meaning of the categories of GTZAN; and we formally define and identify mislabelings. 4. We demonstrate how GTZAN can be useful for future research in MGR, audio similarity, autotagging, etc. 5. We confirm the prediction of Seyerlehner [75, 76] that GTZAN has a large amount of artist repetition; we measure for the first time for GTZAN the effect of this on MGR evaluation. 6. We provide a comprehensive survey of how GTZAN has been used, which ties together 100 published works that use GTZAN for evaluation, and thus are affected by its faults. 1.2 Delimitations This article is concerned only with GTZAN: its composition and faults; its histor- ical and contemporary use for evaluating MGR systems; the effects of its faults on evaluating MGR systems; and how to use it with consideration of its problems. This article is not concerned with other public datasets, which may or may not suffer from the same faults as GTZAN, but which have certainly been used in fewer published works than GTZAN [1]. This article is not concerned with the validity, well-posedness, value, usefulness, or applicability of MGR; or whether MGR is “replaced by,” or used in the service of, e.g., music similarity, autotag- ging, or the like. It is not concerned with making general conclusions about or criticisms of MGR or evaluation in MGR, which are comprehensively addressed in other works, e.g., [1, 83, 84, 105–109]. Finally, it is not concerned with how, or even whether it is possible, to create faultless datasets for MGR, music similarity, autotagging, and the like. 1.3 Criticisms A variety of criticisms have been raised in reviews of this work. First, its useful- ness has been challenged: “recent publications are no longer using GTZAN”; or, “it is already a commonly accepted opinion that the GTZAN dataset should be discarded”; or, “better datasets are available.” The fact is, of all datasets that are publicly available, GTZAN is the one appearing most in published MGR work [1]. The fact is, more papers use GTZAN in the past three years than in the first eight years of its existence (Fig. 3), and none of them mention a “common opinion” 3 that GTZAN should be discarded. Even with its faults, the fact is that GTZAN can be useful [84, 86], and there is no reason to discard it. Our work provides novel insights and perspectives essential for interpreting all published results that use GTZAN, in the past and in the future, and ways for better scientific evalua- tion using it. These facts provide strong argumentation for the publication and preservation of this work in an archival form. One might challenge the aims of published work that uses GTZAN: “to some extent genre classification has been replaced by the more general problem of auto- matic tagging”; or, “genre classification is now critically seen even by the person who compiled GTZAN (personal communication with Tzanetakis).” The fact is, researchers have published and still are publishing a large number of works in MGR that use GTZAN. One might argue, “this article only touches the possi- bility of a critique of genre classification”; or, “it misses the valuable chance to criticize the simplistic and superficial approach to music that governs most of these publications”; or, “it falls short of providing a more rigorous questioning of MGR evaluation and a more general evaluation that goes beyond the GTZAN dataset.” Such aspects, however, are outside the scope of this article delimited above, but are thoroughly addressed by other work, e.g., [1, 83,84,105,107–109]. 2 Analysis of GTZAN To analyze GTZAN, we first identify its excerpts, see how artists compose each category, and survey the ways people describe the music. Finally, we delimit and identify three kinds of faults in the dataset: repetitions, mislabelings, and distortions (summarized in Table 2). 2.1 Identifying excerpts We use the Echo Nest Musical Fingerprinter (ENMFP)3 to generate a fingerprint of every excerpt in GTZAN and to query the Echo Nest database having over 30,000,000 songs. The second column of Table 1 shows that this identifies only 60.6% of the excerpts. We correct titles and artists as much as possible, and find four misidentifications. We then manually identify 313 of the remaining excerpts. The third column of Table 1 shows that we miss the metadata of only 81 excerpts. With this, we can now bound the number of artists in GTZAN — which has been stated to be unknown, e.g., [75, 76]. Assuming each of the unidentified excerpts come from different artists than those we have identified, the total number of artists represented in the excerpts of GTZAN cannot be larger than 329. If all unlabeled excerpts are from the same artists we have identified, then the smallest it can be is 248. 3http://developer.echonest.com 4 last.fm Label ENMFP self song (no. tags) artist (no. tags) Blues 63 100 75 (2904) 25 (2061) Classical 63 97 12 (400) 85 (4044) Country 54 95 81 (2475) 13 (585) Disco 52 90 82 (5041) 8 (194) Hip hop 64 96 90 (6289) 5 (263) Jazz 65 80 54 (1127) 26 (2102) Metal 65 83 73 (5579) 10 (786) Pop 59 96 89 (7173) 7 (665) Reggae 54 82 73 (4352) 9 (616) Rock 67 100 99 (7227) 1 (100) Total 60.6% 91.9% 72.8% (42567) 18.9% (11416) Table 1: For each category of GTZAN: number of excerpts we identify by finger- print (ENMFP); then searching manually (self); number of songs in last.fm (and number of tags having “count” larger than 0); for tracks not found, number of artists in last.fm (and number of tags having “count” larger than 0). Retrieved Dec. 25, 2012, 21h. 2.2 Describing excerpts and categories To survey the ways people describe the music or artist of each excerpt, we query the application programming interface provided by last.fm, and retrieve the “tags” users of the service apply to the songs or artists in GTZAN. A tag is a word or phrase a person uses to describe an artist, or a song, in order to make their music collection more useful for them. On last.fm, tags are most often genre labels (“Blues”) [110], but they can also describe instrumentation (“female vocalists”), tempo (“120 bpm”), mood (“happy”), how the music is used (“exercise”), lyrics (“fa la la la la”), reproduce the band name (“The Rolling Stones”), or something else (“favorite song of all time”) [111]. We assume the tags users give to a song or artist would also be given to the excerpt in GTZAN. Tags from last.fm have been used in other work, e.g., [112,113]. The collection of these tags is of course far from being controlled; but an aspect that helps strengthen their use is that last.fm provides a “count” for each one: a normalized quantity such that 100 means the tag is applied by most listeners, and 0 means the tag is applied by the fewest. We keep only those tags with counts greater than 0. The fourth column of Table 1 shows the number of tracks we identify that have tags in last.fm, and the number of tags with non-zero count. When we do not find tags for a song, we get the tags applied to the artist. For instance, though we identify all 100 excerpts in Blues, only 75 of the songs are tagged. Of these, we get 2,904 tags with non-zero counts. For the remaining 25 songs, we retrieve 2,061 tags from the tags given to the artists. 5 Blues Classical Country Disco Hip hop0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Pe rc en ta ge Robert Johnson Hot Toddy John Lee Hooker Clifton Chenier Buckwheat Zydeco Kelly Joe Phelps Magic Slim & The Teardrops Stevie Ray Vaughan Mozart JS Bach Vivaldi Franz Joseph Haydn Percy Grainger Franz Schubert Claude DebussyMaurice Ravel Henri DutilleuxLeonard Bernstein Beethoven Willie Nelson Vince Gill Brad Paisley George Strait KC and The Sunshine Band The Gibson Brothers Gloria GaynorOttawan A Tribe Called Quest Beastie Boys Public Enemy Cypress Hill Wu−Tang Clan Jazz Metal Pop Reggae Rock0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Pe rc en ta ge Coleman Hawkins Joe Lovano James Carter Branford Marsalis Trio Miles Davis Joe Henderson Dexter Gordon Dio New Bomb Turks Metallica Iron Maiden Dark Tranquillity Black SabbathRage Against The Machine Britney Spears Mandy Moore Destiny’s Child Christina Aguilera Alanis Morissette Janet Jackson Jennifer Lopez Mariah CareyCeline Dion Bob Marley Dennis Brown Prince Buster Burning Spear Gregory Isaacs Queen Led Zeppelin Morphine The Stone Roses Simple Minds Simply Red The Rolling Stones Sting Jethro Tull Survivor Ani DiFranco Figure 1: Artist composition of each GTZAN category.

We do not include unidentified excerpts. 6 We devise the following novel approach to identify the top tags of a music excerpt. Let ωi be its ith tag, and ci be its count. Given the set of |I| tag-count pairs {(wi, ci)}i∈I , we call the top tags of an excerpt T := {(wj , cj)}j∈J⊆I those that contribute the majority of the total tag count, i.e., J := arg min J ′⊆I |J ′| subject to min j∈J ′ {cj} > max i∈I\J ′ {ci}, ∑ j∈J ′ cj > 1 2 ∑ i∈I ci. (1) For example, consider an excerpt has the set of tag-count pairs: {(“folk”, 11), (“blues”, 100), (“blues guitar”, 90)}. Its total tag count is 201, and so its top tags are “blues” and “blues guitar”, which account for 94.6% = 100(100 + 90)/201 of the total tag count. We argue that the top tags of an excerpt give a satisfactory description of music content since they are given by the majority of users who have tagged the piece of music. In our previous analysis of GTZAN [103], we assume that since there is a category named, e.g., “Country,” then the content of those excerpts should possess typical and distinguishing characteristics of music using the country genre [114]: stringed instruments such as guitar, mandolin, banjo; emphasized “twang” in playing and singing; lyrics about patriotism, hard work and hard times; and so on. This leads us to claim in [103] that at least seven excerpts are mislabeled “Country” because they have few of these characteristics. In fact, we find other work that assumes the concepts of two music genre datasets overlap because they share the same labels, e.g., the taxonomies in [26,58]. We make no such assumption here, and instead consider a label of GTZAN to represent the set of top tags of the set of excerpts labeled so. To find the top tags of the set of excerpts with a label, we first construct for the set of tag-count pairs {(wk, ck))}k∈K by summing the counts for all |K| unique tags of the identified excerpts. We then compute the normalized count of each tag: c¯(wk) := ck /∑ k∈K ck (2) and finally define the top tags of this category by (1). Figure 2 shows the top tags for each category, where we can see that most of the top tags are indicative of genre. Now, we can see how GTZAN Blues means more than the blues of, e.g., Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker; and how GTZAN Disco is more broad than the dance music from the seventies [114,115]. 2.3 Identifying faults: Repetitions We consider four types of repetition, from high to low specificity: exact, recording, artist, and version. We define an exact repetition as when two excerpts are the same to such a degree that their time-frequency fingerprints are highly similar. To find exact repetitions, we implement a simplified version of the Shazam fingerprint [116], compare every pair of excerpts, and then listen to confirm. The second column of Table 2 shows these In total, we find 50 exact repetitions in GTZAN. 7 We define a recording repetition as when two excerpts come from the same recording, but are not detected with fingerprinting. We find these by looking for artists and songs appearing multiple times in the metadata. To confirm, we listen to the excerpts. The second and third columns of Table 2 shows these. We find Pop has the most exact and recording repetitions (16): “Lady Marmalade” sung by Christina Aguilera et al., as well as “Bootylicious” by Destiny’s Child, each appear four times. In total, we find 21 recording repetitions in GTZAN. We define artist repetition as excerpts performed by the same artist, which are easily found using the metadata. Table 2 shows how every category of GTZAN has artist repetition. We see the 100 excerpts in Blues come from only nine artists; and more than a third of the excerpts labeled Reggae come from Bob Marley. We define a version repetition as when two excerpts are of the same song but performed differently. This could be a studio version, a live version, performed by the same or different artists, or even a remix. We identify these with the metadata, and then confirming by listening. For instance, Classical 44 and 48 are from “Rhapsody in Blue” by George Gershwin, but performed by different orchestras. Metal 33 is “Enter Sandman” by Metallica, and Metal 74 is a parody. In total, we find 13 version repetitions in GTZAN. 2.4 Identifying faults: Mislabelings In [103], we consider two kinds of mislabelings: contentious and conspicuous. We based these upon non-concrete criteria formed loosely around musicological principles associated with the genre labels of GTZAN — which we have shown above are not indicative of the content of each category. Here, we formalize the identification of mislabeled excerpts by using the concept of top tags we develop above. Consider an excerpt with label g ∈ G has the set of tag-normalized count pairs X = {(wi, c¯i(wi))}i∈I . We know label r ∈ G has the set of top tag-normalized count pairs Tr = {(yj , d¯(yj))}j∈Jr . We define the r-label score of X C(X , Tr) := ∑ j∈Jr d¯j(yj) ∑ i∈I c¯i(ωi)δyj≡wi (3) where δyj≡wi = 1 if yj and wi are identical, or zero otherwise. Note, this compares all tags of an excerpt to only the top tags of label r. Now, if C(X , Tg) is too small (the tags of the excerpt have too little in common with the top tags of its label), or if C(X , Tr) is too large for an r 6= g (the tags of the excerpt have more in common with the top tags of another label), then we say the excerpt is mislabeled. 8 Label Repetitions Mislabelings Distortions Exact Recording Artist Version Blues John Lee Hooker (0-11); Robert Johnson (12-28); Kelly Joe Phelps (29-39); Stevie Ray Vaughn (40- 49); Magic Slim (50-60); Clifton Chenier (61-72); Buckwheat Zydeco (73-84); Hot Toddy (85-97); Al- bert Collins (98, 99) Classical (42,53) (51,80) J.

Last column shows values we use to test for significant differences. To test for these conditions, we use the scores between the top tag-normalized count pairs of the GTZAN labels, C(Tg, Tr), which we call paired label scores. These values are shown in Table 3. For example, the fourth element along the diagonal is the score in GTZAN Disco for a song having the same tags and nor- malized counts as GTZAN Disco — the “perfect” GTZAN Disco excerpt since its tags reflect the majority description of GTZAN Disco. The element to its right is its score in GTZAN Hip hop; and the element to its left is its score in GTZAN Country. We say an excerpt labeled g is mislabeled if its score in its label is an order of magnitude smaller than the paired label score, i.e., C(X , Tg) < C(Tg, Tg)/10 (4) or if its score for another category r 6= g is too large, i.e., C(X , Tr) > C(Tg, Tg)−∆g, (5) where ∆g is one-tenth the largest magnitude difference between all pairs of ele- ments from {C(Tg, Tr)}g,r∈G . The values of ∆g for each label are shown in the last column of Table 3. We divide by 10 in order to allow differences in scores that are an order of magnitude less than the largest difference in each row. We also find experimentally that this finds many of the same mislabelings mentioned in our previous work [103]. For example, Pop 81 is “Leaning On The Everlasting Arm” by Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and has top tags (with normalized counts): “african” (0.270), “world” (0.195) and “southafrica” (0.097). Its only non-zero score is 0.00010 in GTZAN Rock, and so we consider this excerpt mislabeled (but not necessarily better labeled GTZAN Rock). Disco 11 — “Can You Feel It” by Billy Ocean from 1998 — has top tags “rock” (0.33) and “pop” (0.33), and has a score in GTZAN Disco of 0.018 > 0.0527/10; but its score in GTZAN Pop is 0.06415 > 0.018−0.004. Hence, we consider it mislabeled. We do not consider the 81 excerpts we have yet to identify. In total, we find 93 mislabelings, and show 59 in Table 2. 2.5 Identifying faults: Distortions The last column of Table 2 lists some distortions we find by listening to every excerpt in GTZAN.

Table 4 estimates the “ideal” confusion table, which we construct using the scores of the mislabeled excerpts in Table 2. For instance, Country 39 has its highest score in Blues, so we add one to the Blues label in the Country column. On the other hand, Hip hop 40 has its highest score in Hip hop, but its score in Pop is high enough to consider it significant (per the definition above), so we add 0.5 to both Hip hop and Pop. For Pop 81, where hardly any of the tags match the top tags of the GTZAN labels, we assign a weight of 0.1 to all labels. We also assume that the first 5 seconds of Reggae 86 are representative enough of GTZAN Reggae. Finally, we assume that the 81 excerpts we have yet to identify have “correct” labels. From Table 4, we can estimate the best recalls (the diagonal), the best precisions (last column), and the best F-scores (last row). The best classification accuracy (bottom right corner) is around 94.5%. Hence, if the classification accuracy of an MGR system tested in GTZAN is better that this, then it might actually be performing worse than the “perfect” system. 3 GTZAN in MGR Research Figure 3 shows how the number of publications that use GTZAN has increased since its creation in 2002. The next most used publicly-available dataset is that created for the ISMIR 2004 MGR contest [117], which appears in 75 works, 30 of which use GTZAN as well [4, 20, 30, 31, 37–39,47–50,54, 55, 57, 58, 60–64,67, 72, 73,75–77,86,94,98,100]. Of the 100 works that use GTZAN, 49 of them only use GTZAN [2, 3, 5, 7–11, 13, 14, 16–19, 21–25, 27, 29, 32–34, 36, 41, 42, 45, 46, 51, 53, 59, 65,66,69,71,74,79–85,91,95–97,101]. 11 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 200 2 11 2 200 3 18 2 200 4 27 1 200 5 32 5 200 6 41 8 200 7 30 3 200 8 38 6 200 9 49 9 201 0 65 22 201 1 55 19 201 2 47 20P ub lic at ion s using GTZAN not using GTZAN Figure 3: Annual numbers of published works in MGR with experimental compo- nents, divided into ones that use and do no use GTZAN. 3.1 Listening to GTZAN Among 100 works, we find only five (outside our recent work [83–86]), that indicate someone has listened to at least some of GTZAN. The first appears to be Li and Sleep [42], who find that “... two closely numbered files in each genre tend to sound similar than the files numbered far [apart].” Bergstra et al. [12] note that, “To our ears, the examples are well-labeled ... our impression from listening to the music is that no artist appears twice.” This is contradicted by Seyerlehner et al. [76], who predict “an artist effect ... as listening to some of the songs reveals that some artists are represented with several songs.” In his doctoral dissertation, Seyerlehner [75] infers there to be a significant replication of artists in GTZAN because of how classifiers trained and tested in that dataset perform as compared to other artist-filtered datasets. Very few works mention specific faults in GTZAN. Hartmann [28] notes finding seven duplicates, but mentions no specifics. In [15,56,71,74], the authors describe GTZAN as having 993 or 999 excerpts. In personal communication, de los Santos mentions that they found seven corrupted files in Classical (though [71,74] report them being in Reggae). Li and Chan [46], who manually estimate the key of all GTZAN excerpts, mention in personal communication that they remember hearing some repetitions. Their key estimates4 are consistent among the exact repetitions we find in GTZAN. 3.2 Using GTZAN In our review of evaluation in MGR [1], we delimit ten different experimental designs. In the 100 works using GTZAN, 96 employ the experimental design Classify [2–14,16–18,20–76,78–100] (an excerpt is assigned a class, and that class is compared against a “ground truth”). In seven papers, GTZAN is used with the design Retrieve [15,19,22,38,77,79,101] (a query is used to find similar music, and the labels of the retrieved items are compared). The work in [8] uses GTZAN in 4http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/downloads/#gtzankeys 12 the design Cluster (data is clustered, and the composition of the resulting clusters are inspected). Our work in [83] uses Compose, where a system is trained on GTZAN, and then generates music it finds highly representative of each GTZAN label. With a formal listening test of these representative excerpts, we find humans cannot recognize the genres they supposedly represent. The design parameters in these works vary. For Classify, most works measure MGR performance by classification accuracy (the ratio of “correct” predictions to all observations) computed from k-fold stratified cross-validation (kfCV), e.g., 2fCV (4 papers) [7,22,23,56], 3fCV (3 papers) [18,71,74], 5fCV (6 papers) [3,13,30, 31,53,100], and 10fCV (55 papers) [2,5,9,11,14,16,17,24–26,28,29,34,35,37,39–42, 44,47–51,57,58,60–64,66–68,70,72,73,75,76,78,79,82–85,88–91,94–96,98,99]. Most of these use a single run of cross-validation; however, some perform multiple runs, e.g., 10 independent runs of 2fCV (10x2CV) [56] or 20x2fCV [22, 23], 10x3fCV [71,74], and 10x10fCV [37,70,72,75,83–85]. In one experiment, Li and Sleep [42] use 10fCV with random partitions; but in another, they partition the excerpts into folds based on their file number — roughly implementing an artist filter. Finally, leave one out cross-validation appears in [32,33]. Some works measure classification accuracy using a split of the data, e.g., 60/40 [8] (60% used to train, 40% used to test), 70/30 [10, 43], 75/25 [59], 80/20 [12,45,52,65], 90/10 [10,81,92,93,97], and training/validation/testing of 50/20/30 [27]. Half of these report results from a single split [8, 10, 12, 27, 45, 52]; but the other half reports a mean of many trials, e.g., 5 [43], 30 [97], and 100 trials [65, 81, 92, 93]. Seven papers [6, 21, 38, 56, 59, 69, 87] do not coherently describe their design parameters. In some cases, only a portion of GTZAN is used, e.g., [4] performs 5x5fCV us- ing only Classical, Jazz and Pop; [36] uses Blues, Classical, Country and Disco; [80] uses several combinations of GTZAN categories; and [20] states a three-genre sub- set is used, but provide no details on which they use. Other works add to GTZAN, e.g., [8] adds 100 excerpts of Portuguese music to GTZAN Classical, Metal, and Reggae; [87] augments the excerpts in Classical and Jazz with recordings of inter- net radio; and [46] uses all of GTZAN, and augments it with pitch-shifted and/or time-scaled versions. 13 o th er 10 fC V 5f CV 3f CV 2f CV HighestReportedAccuracy [26] [56] [21] [64] [16] [62] [7] [79] [61] [23] [5] [37] [78] [9] [94] [35] [99] [95] [75] [34] [73] [98] [63] [27] [45] [84] [29] [12] [69] [83] [70] [3] [67] [24] [38] [100] [51] [13] [14] [42] [97] [39] [11] [44] [40] [60] [17] [22] [57] [90] [49] [52] [89] [58] [72] [43] [68] [10] [48] [66] [65] [31] [96] [30] [6] [50] [88] [91] [71] [41] [74] [18] [82] [46] [33] [32] [81] [53] [92] [59] [28] [25] [85] [2] 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 F ig u re 4: H ig h es t cl as si fi ca ti on ac cu ra ci es (y -a x is ) re p o rt ed (c ro ss -r ef er en ce s la b el ed ) w it h ex p er im en ta l d es ig n C la ss if y u si n g al l G T Z A N .

Since 96 of 100 papers use Classify to evaluate MGR systems, most papers report classification accuracy as a figure of merit, and some work use this figure to compare systems for recognizing music genre. We have criticized this approach to evaluation [84], and argued that it lacks the validity necessary to make any meaningful comparisons between systems [105]. 3.3 Reported classification accuracies in GTZAN Figure 4 shows the highest classification accuracies reported in 96 papers that consider the 10-class problem of GTZAN (we remove duplicated experiments, e.g., [48] contains the results reported in [47]). The thick gray line in Fig. 4 shows our estimate of the “perfect” classification accuracy from Table 4. Six results (marked with a red “x”) are incorrect or have been challenged: the results in [61,62,64] are due to a mistake in the experimental procedure [84], as are those in [56];5 the result in [16] contradicts many others [85]; and the results in [7] are not likely to come from the system [118]. 4 The faults of GTZAN and evaluation In this section, we disprove the following two claims: 1) “all MGR systems and evaluations are affected in the same ways by the faults in GTZAN”; and 2) “the performances of all MGR systems in GTZAN, working with the same data and faults, are still meaningfully comparable.” Such claims have been made in reviews of this work, but also appear in [99]. We now study how the faults of GTZAN affect the evaluation of MGR systems, e.g., the estimation of classification accuracy using Classify in GTZAN. It is not difficult to predict how these faults can affect the evaluations of particular systems. For instance, when exact replicas are distributed across train and test sets, the evaluation of some systems can be more biased than others: a nearest neighbor classifier will find features in the training set with zero distance to the test feature, while a Bayesian classifier with a parametric model may not so strongly benefit when its model parameters are estimated from all training features. If there are replicas in the test set only, then they will bias our estimate of a figure of merit because they are not independent tests — if one is classified (in)correctly then its replicas are also classified (in)correctly. Thus, we already have a notion that the two claims above are not true. In addition to exact repetitions, we show above that the number of artists in GTZAN is at most 329. Thus, as Seyerlehner [75, 76] predicts for GTZAN, the evaluation of systems will certainly be biased due to the artist effect [119–122], i.e., the observation that a music similarity system can perform significantly worse 5Personal communication with J. P. Papa. 15 when artists are disjoint in training and test datasets, than when they are not. Since all results in Fig. 4 come from evaluations without an artist filter, they will likely be optimistic. What has yet to be shown for GTZAN, however, is just how optimistic they might be. After presenting our experimental method, we then present our results, and discuss the veracity of the two claims above. 4.1 Method We use three classifiers with the same features [123]: nearest neighbor (NN); mini- mum distance (MD); and minimum Mahalanobis distance (MMD). We implement these classifiers in PRTools [124]. We create feature vectors from a 30-s excerpt in the following way. For each 46.4 ms frame, and a hop half that, we compute: 13 MFCCs using the approach in [125], zero crossings, and spectral centroid and rolloff. For each 130 consecutive frames, we compute the mean and variance of each dimension, thus producing nine 32-dimensional feature vectors for each ex- cerpt. We normalize the dimensions of the training set features, i.e., we find and apply the transformation mapping each dimension to [0, 1]. We apply the same transformation to the test set. Each classifier labels an excerpt as follows: NN randomly selects among the majority labels given to the nine feature vectors; MD and MMD both select the label with the maximum log posterior sum over the nine feature vectors. In addition to there, we test two state-of-the-art MGR systems that produce some of the highest classification accuracies reported in GTZAN. The first is SRCAM — proposed in [61] and modified in [84] — which uses psychoacoustically- motivated features in 768 dimensions. SRCAM classifies an excerpt by sparse representation classification [126]. We use the SPGL1 solver [127] with at most 200 iterations, and 2 := 0.01. The second system is MAPsCAT, which uses features computed with the scattering transform [3]. This produces 40 feature vectors of 469 dimensions for a 30-s excerpt. MAPsCAT estimates from the training set the mean for each class, the total covariance matrix, and computes for a test feature the log posterior in each class. We define all classes equally likely for MAPsCAT, as well as MD and MMD. We normalize the features of the training and test sets. We give further details of SRCAM and MAPsCAT in [84]. We evaluate each system using GTZAN with four different kinds of parti- tioning: ten realizations of standard non-stratified 2fCV (ST); ST without the 68 exact and recording repetitions and 2 distortions (ST’); a non-stratified 2fCV with artist filtering (AF); AF without the 68 exact and recording repetitions and 2 distortions (AF’). Table 5 shows the composition of each fold of AF in terms of artists. We created AF manually to ensure that: 1) each class is approximately balanced in terms of the number of training and testing excerpts; and 2) each fold of a class has music representative of its top tags (Fig. 2). For instance, the Blues folds have 46 and 54 excerpts, and both have Delta blues and zydeco. We retain the original labels of all excerpts, and evaluate all systems using the same partitions. We look at several figures of merit: confusion, precision, recall, F-score, and 16 Fold 1 Fold 2 Blues John Lee Hooker, Kelly Joe Phelps, Buck- wheat Zydeco, Magic Slim & The Teardrops Robert Johnson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Clifton Chenier, Hot Toddy, Albert Collins Classical J.

Table 5: Composition of each fold of the artist filter partitioning (500 excerpts in each). Italicized artists appear in two categories. classification accuracy. Consider that the ith fold of a cross-validation experiment consists of N (g) i excerpts of label g ∈ G, and that of these a system classifies as r ∈ G the number M (g as r)i ≤ N (g)i . We define the confusion of label g as r of this fold as C (g as r) i := M (g as r) i / N (g) i . (6) Thus, C (g as g) i is the recall for class g in the ith fold. The normalized accuracy of a system in the ith fold is defined by Ai := 1 |G| ∑ g∈G C (g as g) i . (7) We use normalized accuracy because the classes are not equally represented in the test sets. Finally, the precision of a system for class X in the ith fold is P (X) i := M (X as X) i /∑ Y ∈G M (Y as X) i (8) and the F-score of an system for label X in the ith fold is F (X) i := 2P (X) i C (X as X) i / [ P (X) i + C (X as X) i ] . (9) To test for significant differences in performance between two systems, we first build contingency tables for all observations they classify [128]. Define the rv N to 17 MD MMD NN SRCAM MAPsCAT 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 No rm ali ze d Ac cu ra cy ST ST’ AF AF’ Figure 5: Normalized accuracy (7) of each system (x-axis) for each fold (left and right) of different partitioning (legend). be the number of times the two systems choose different classes, but one is correct. Let t12 be the number for which system 1 is correct but system 2 is wrong. Thus, N − t12 is the number of observations for which system 2 is correct but system 1 is wrong. Define the rv T12 from which t12 is a sample. The null hypothesis is that the systems perform equally well given N = n, i.e., E[T12|N = n] = n/2, in which case T12 is distributed binomial, i.e., pT12|N=n(t) = ( n t ) (0.5)n, 0 ≤ t ≤ n. (10) The probability we observe a particular performance given the systems perform equally well is p := P [T12 ≤ min(t12, n− t12)] + P [T12 ≥ max(t12, n− t12)] = min(t12,n−t12)∑ t=0 pT12|N=n(t) + n∑ t=max(t12,n−t12) pT12|N=n(t). (11) We define statistical significance as α = 0.05. In other words, we reject the null hypothesis when p < α. 4.2 Experimental results and discussion Figure 5 shows the normalized accuracies (7) of all five systems for each fold of the four different kinds of partitioning. For the ten partitions of ST and ST’, we show the mean normalized accuracy, and one standard deviation above and below. It is immediately clear that estimates of the classification accuracy for each system are affected by the faults of GTZAN. We see that the differences between ST and ST’ are small for all systems except NN. As we predict above, the performance of NN 18 appears to benefit more than the others from the exact and recording repetitions, which boost its mean normalized accuracy from about 0.6 to 0.63. Between AF and AF’, removing the repetitions produces very little change since the artist filter keeps exact and recording repetitions from appearing in both train and test sets. Most clearly, we see for all five systems large decreases in performance between ST and AF. The difference in normalized accuracy of MD between ST and AF appears the smallest (7 points), while that of MAPsCAT appears the most (25 points). Since we have thus found systems with performance evaluations affected to different magnitudes by the faults in GTZAN — that of NN is hurt by removing the repetitions while that of MMD is not — this disproves the first claim above. Testing for significant difference in performance between all pairs of system in both ST and ST’, only for MMD and NN do we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Furthermore, in terms of classification accuracy in ST, we can say with statistical significance: MD < {MMD, NN} < MAPsCAT < SRCAM, i.e., SRCAM per- forms the best and MD performs the worst. In both AF and AF’, however, for MAPsCAT and MD, and for MAPsCAT and MMD, do we fail to reject the null hy- pothesis. In this case, we can say with statistical significance: NN < {MAPsCAT, MD} < {MAPsCAT, MMD} < SRCAM. Therefore, while our conclusion on the basis of our evaluation in ST is that MAPsCAT performs significantly better than all these systems except SRCAM, its evaluation in AF says otherwise. This dis- proves the second claim above. We now focus our analysis upon SRCAM. Figure 6 shows other figures of merit for SRCAM averaged over 10 realizations of ST and ST’ partitions, as well as for the single partition AF’. Between ST and ST’, we see very little change in the recalls for classes with the few exact and recording repetitions: Blues, Classical and Rock. However, for the classes having the most exact and recording repetitions, we find large changes in their recalls. In fact, Fig. 7 shows that the number of exact and recording repetitions in a category is correlated with a decrease in its recall for SRCAM. This makes sense as SRCAM can be seen as a kind of adaptive nearest neighbors. When evaluating SRCAM in AF’, Fig. 6 shows our estimate of its classification accuracy in ST decreases by 22 points (28%). With respect to F-score, Classical appears to suffers the least; but we see decreases for all other classes by at least 10%, e.g., 77% for Blues, 46% for Rock, and 44% for Reggae. We see little change in our estimated classification accuracy when testing in AF’ instead of AF (not shown), but our estimates of recalls, precisions, and F-scores for four classes increase, while those for thee classes decrease. In all figures of merit above, we have not considered the 59 mislabelings in GTZAN noted in Table 2. We thus assign new labels to each of the 59 excerpts based on which class has highest score (3) for the excerpt. If the score is zero in every class, e.g., Pop 81, we keep the original label. We assume that the 81 excerpts we have yet to identify have “correct” labels. The new figures of merit for SRCAM, seen in Fig. 6(d), show even further deterioration. Compared to the figures of merit in ST, we are quite far from the “perfect” statistics in Table 4. 19 (a) SRCAM, ST (b) SRCAM, ST’ (c) SRCAM, AF’ (d) SRCAM, AF’ with relabeling using (3) Figure 6: Confusion, precision (Pr), F-score (F), and normalized accuracy (bottom right corner) for SRCAM evaluated with (ST) and without repetitions (ST’) averaged over 10 realizations, as well as with artist filtering and without replicas (AF’), and finally taking mislabelings into account.

Excerpt numbers in parentheses. Based on these results, one might be inclined to argue that, though it is clearly performing poorly overall, SRCAM appears to recognize when music uses the classical genre. This appearance evaporates when we see in Table 6 what Classical excerpts SRCAM confuses for Blues, Country, Disco, Jazz, Metal, and Rock, and which non-Classical excerpts SRCAM confuses for Classical. This argues the contrary that SRCAM has some capacity to recognize when music uses the classical genre. (We see the same kinds of catastrophic failures for Metal, the other class for which SRCAM appears to do well.) 21 5 Conclusions on the future use of GTZAN It should now be incontrovertible that since all 96 systems in Fig. 4 are evaluated using GTZAN in ST, we are unable to judge which is good at reproducing the labels in GTZAN when efforts are taken to deal with the faults of GTZAN, let alone which, if any, has any capacity to recognize genres used by music in the real world, and is thus useful for MGR. MAPsCAT and SRCAM, previously evaluated in GTZAN to have classification accuracies of 83% using ST [83,84], now sit at the bottom of Fig. 4. Where all the others lie, we do not yet know; but we now know that these were two systems with classification accuracies superior to 56 others in Fig. 4. Furthermore, the picture becomes more bleak when we scratch below the surface: for the class in which its figures of merit are the best, SRCAM shows behaviors that are utterly confusing if it really is recognizing that genre. One might now hold little hope that GTZAN has ever been or could ever be useful for tasks such as evaluating systems for MGR, audio similarity, autotagging, etc. However, we have done just that in our analysis above, as well as in previous work [83, 84]. A proper analysis of the results of an MGR system tested on GTZAN must take care of the content of GTZAN, i.e., the music. It is not a question of what figure of merit to use, but of how to draw a valid conclusion with an experimental design that determines whether the decisions and behaviors of a system are related to the musical content that is supposedly behind those decisions [105]. Some argue that our litany of faults above ignores what they say is the most serious problem with GTZAN: that it is too small to produce meaningful results. In some respects, this is justified. While personal music collections may number thousands of pieces of music, commercial datasets and library archives number in the millions. The 1000 excerpts of GTZAN can certainly be argued an insufficient random sample of the population of excerpts “exemplary” of the genres between which one wishes a useful MGR system to discriminate. Hence, one might argue, it is unreasonably optimistic to assume an MGR system can learn from a fraction of GTZAN those characteristics common to particular genres. It is beyond the scope of this paper whether or not a system can learn from GTZAN the meaning of the descriptors we see in Fig. 2. However, though a dataset may be larger and more modern than GTZAN, does not mean it is free of the same kinds of faults we find in GTZAN. At least with GTZAN, one now has a manageable, public, and finally well-studied dataset, which is now new and improved with metadata. As one final comment, that a dataset is large does not free the creator of an MGR system of the necessarily difficult task of designing, implementing, and ana- lyzing an evaluation having the validity to conclude how well the system solves or even addresses the problem of MGR. In fact, no valid and meaningful conclusion can come from an evaluation of an MGR system using Classify in GTZAN, or for that matter, any dataset having uncontrolled independent variables [84, 105]. Other approaches to evaluation are necessary, and luckily, there are many alter- natives [1]. 22 Acknowledgments Thanks to: Mark Levy for helpful discussions about last.fm tags; Mads G.
