ABSTRACT: 
We describe selected artistic and statistical depictions of the force of mortality (hazard or mortality rate), which is a concept that has long preoccupied actuaries, demographers and statisticians. We provide a more graphic form for the force-of-mortality function that makes the relationship between its constituents more explicit. The 'Bridge of human life' in Addison's allegorical essay of 1711 provides a particularly vivid image, with the forces depicted as external. The model that was used by Gompertz in 1825 appears to treat the forces as internal. In his 1897 essay Pearson mathematically modernized 'the medieval conception of the relation between Death and Chance' by decomposing the full mortality curve into five distributions along the age axis, the results of five 'marksmen' aiming at the human mass crossing this bridge. We describe Addison's imagery, comment briefly on Gompertz's law and the origin of the term 'force of mortality', describe the background for Pearson's essay, as well as his imagery and statistical model, and give the bridge of life a modern form, illustrating it via statistical animation.

We observed that some patients with clinical leptospirosis supported by positive results ofrapid tests were negative for leptospirosis on the basis of our diagnostic gold standard, which involves isolationof Leptospira species from blood culture and/or a positive result of a microscopic agglutination test (MAT).We hypothesized that our reference standard was imperfect and used statistical modeling to investigate thishypothesis.Methods. Data for 1652 patients with suspected leptospirosis recruited during three observational studies andone randomized control trial that described the application of culture, MAT, immunoﬂuorescence assay (IFA),lateral ﬂow (LF) and/or PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene were reevaluated using Bayesian latent class modelsand random-effects meta-analysis.Results. The estimated sensitivities of culture alone, MAT alone, and culture plus MAT (for which the resultwas considered positive if one or both tests had a positive result) were 10.5% (95% credible interval [CrI],2.7%–27.5%), 49.8% (95% CrI, 37.6%–60.8%), and 55.5% (95% CrI, 42.9%–67.7%), respectively. These low sensi-tivities were present across all 4 studies. The estimated speciﬁcity of MAT alone (and of culture plus MAT) was98.8% (95% CrI, 92.8%–100.0%). The estimated sensitivities and speciﬁcities of PCR (52.7% [95% CrI, 45.2%–60.6%] and 97.2% [95% CrI, 92.0%–99.8%], respectively), lateral ﬂow test (85.6% [95% CrI, 77.5%–93.2%] and96.2% [95% CrI, 87.7%–99.8%], respectively), and immunoﬂuorescence assay (45.5% [95% CrI, 33.3%–60.9%]and 96.8% [95% CrI, 92.8%–99.8%], respectively) were considerably different from estimates in which culture plusMAT was considered a perfect gold standard test.Conclusions. Our ﬁndings show that culture plus MAT is an imperfect gold standard against which tocompare alterative tests for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. Rapid point-of-care tests for this infection would bringan important improvement in patient care, but their future evaluation will require careful consideration of thereference test(s) used and the inclusion of appropriate statistical models.Received 4 December 2011; accepted 21 March 2012; eletronically published20 April 2012.Correspondence: Direk Limmathurotsakul, MD, PhD, 420/6 Mahidol-OxfordTropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University,Rajvithee Rd, Bangkok, 10400 Thailand (direk@tropmedres.ac).Clinical Infectious Diseases 2012;55(3):322–31© The Author 2012.

Thecommon signs and symptoms of this infection fail to discrimi-nate leptospirosis from a range of other infectious diseasesthat occur in the tropics, including dengue fever, malaria, andrickettsial infection [1]. Although laboratory diagnosis has thepotential to guide the management of patients with leptospi-rosis, this is not currently achieved in most regions of theworld because of a lack of point-of-care tests. Once such testsbecome available, however, it will be important to ensure thatthe diagnostic reference standard against which they are com-pared during clinical evaluation is robust.We have undertaken several therapeutic and diagnosticevaluation studies involving patients presenting to hospitals inThailand with suspected leptospirosis [2–5]. The referencetests used were a combination of culture for Leptospira speciesand the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Deﬁnite lepto-spirosis was deﬁned as the isolation of Leptospira species froma normally sterile site and/or a 4-fold increase in the MATtiter between acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples ora single MAT titer of ≥1:400. This is consistent with the pub-lished recommendations of the World Health OrganizationLeptospirosis Burden Epidemiology Reference Group [6].We began to question the accuracy of the recommended ap-proach after becoming increasingly aware that some patientswith suspected leptospirosis who had positive results of alterna-tive tests, such as a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)targeting the gene encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)subunit, a lateral ﬂow test, and/or an immunoﬂuorescenceassay (IFA), were negative for leptospirosis on the basis of ourreference standard. This was a consistent ﬁnding across differ-ent studies in which we had obtained a convalescent-phase spe-cimen from the majority of cases. We hypothesized that thereference standard was imperfect and that the accuracy of alter-native diagnostic tests, estimated using the gold standard, wasbiased. We sought an appropriate statistical model with whichto determine the true accuracy of alternative tests in thissituation.Bayesian latent class models have been increasingly used toevaluate the true accuracy of diagnostic tests and do not requirethe assumption that any test or combination of tests isperfect [7,8].TheobjectiveofthisstudywastouseBayesianlatentclass models to reanalyze individual-level data from 4 existingdata sets gathered during studies of patients presenting to thehospital with suspected leptospirosis. On the basis of these ﬁnd-ings, we estimated the true accuracy of a range of serological andmolecular diagnostic tests for leptospirosis and determined theimpact of an imperfect gold standard on the reported accuraciesof alternative tests. Information from all studies was combinedusing Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis to further supportthe observations from individual studies.METHODSWe followed a standard protocol for meta-analyses [9], togeth-er with the methods recommended by the Cochrane Diagnos-tic Test Accuracy Working Group, the STARD (Standards forthe Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy) statement, and thePRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewsand Meta-analyses) statement [10].Search Strategy and Study SelectionOur aim was to reanalyze complete individual-level data setscreated by us during hospital-based studies of suspected lepto-spirosis conducted in northeast Thailand between 2000 and2010 (Table 1). All studies had undertaken prospective enroll-ment of adult patients (age, >14 years) with suspected lepto-spirosis and had used a combination of blood culture forLeptospira species and MAT (hereafter, “culture plus MAT”)as the diagnostic reference standard. Studies were selected ifindividual-level data sets were available for analysis. For pa-tients included in >1 study, only data from the ﬁrst study wereused in the analysis.Ethics StatementEthical approval for all studies included in the analysis wasobtained from the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, andthe Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, UnitedKingdom. Written inform consent was obtained from eachsubject enrolled into these studies [2–5].Diagnostic TestsAll diagnostic tests that were used in each study were evaluated.In each study, blood was collected on the day of admission andcultured for Leptospira organisms, as described previously [3].Serum samples (5 mL) collected on admission and, if avail-able, at a 2-week follow-up visit were used for serologicaltesting. Serum was stored at −80°C between collection andserological testing. The MAT was performed at the WorldHealth Organization/United Nations Food and AgricultureOrganization/World Animal Health Organization CollaboratingCenter for Reference and Research on Leptospirosis in Brisbane,Australia. The panel of serovars used in the MAT includedrepresentative serovars from all serogroups known to causeleptospirosis in Thailand. A real-time PCR assay targeting the16S rRNA subunit, a lateral ﬂow test (Leptotek, BioMerieux, theNetherlands), and an in-house IFA were performed as describedpreviously [2, 11, 12]. The MAT detects crude antibodies againstLeptospira organisms, the lateral ﬂow test detects immunoglobu-lin M (IgM), and the IFA detects immunoglobulin G, immuno-globulin A, and IgM [11, 12]. All tests were performed byexperienced technicians. The readers of results of culture, MAT,and other diagnostic tests in each study were blinded to theresults of the other tests and any clinical information.Diagnostic Tests for Leptospirosis ￿ CID 2012:55 (1 August) ￿ 323Statistical AnalysisCulture Plus MAT as Gold Standard ModelFive diagnostic tests (culture, MAT, IFA, lateral ﬂow test, andPCR) were analyzed for each of the studies, using culture plusMAT as the gold standard. Prevalence, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, andpositive and negative predictive values for each of the 6 testswere calculated using Stata 11.1 (Stata, College Station, TX).Bayesian Latent Class ModelsUse of latent class models and Bayesian latent class models todetermine the accuracy of diagnostic tests when the accuracyof the gold standard is imperfect or unknown has been de-scribed in detail elsewhere [13–15]. Figure 1 illustrates howthe imperfect gold standard model estimates unbiased accura-cies of diagnostic tests in one example scenario: application of3 diagnostic tests to 1 study population. In brief, use of Baye-sian latent class models does not assume that any test or acombination of any tests is perfect but considers that each testcould be imperfect in diagnosing the true disease status. Thetrue disease status of the patient population is then deﬁned onthe basis of the overall prevalence (the probability that apatient with suspected leptospirosis is truly infected) [13–15].Latent class models estimate the prevalence and accuracy ofeach test on the basis of the observed frequency of the possiblecombinations of test results.To estimate the accuracy of a diagnostic test by use of latentclass models, the best-ﬁtting model, as determined by thepresence or absence of correlation between diagnostic tests inthe model, should be used [14, 15]. Possible correlations weevaluated were based on existing knowledge and external evi-dence. Therefore, correlation among antigenic tests (cultureand PCR) and correlation among serological tests (MAT, IFA,and the lateral ﬂow test) were considered. All models assumedthat no prior information (noninformative priors) about theunknown parameters (ie, prevalence, sensitivities, and speciﬁc-ities) was available, except that the speciﬁcity of culture wasﬁxed at 100%. For multicenter studies [4, 5], the models alsoassumed that sensitivities and speciﬁcities of culture and MATwere consistent over different study sites. All parameters andassociated 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were estimated usingWinBUGS 1.4 [16].To estimate the overall accuracy of culture alone, MATalone, and culture plus MAT across all studies, the informa-tion obtained from the best-ﬁtting Bayesian latent class modelfor each data set was combined using a Bayesian meta-analysismodel [17]. Random effects were used to account for differ-ences in the sensitivities of culture and MAT and the speciﬁ-city of MAT between studies. The ranges of each parameterfrom the Bayesian latent class model with the best ﬁt obtainedfor individual data sets were used as informative priors in themeta-analysis model [17]. Appendixes 1 and 2 (Supplemen-tary Materials) provide full data sets and all of the modelsused, respectively. Appendix 3 (Supplementary Materials) pro-vides details about the method and the results for the best-ﬁtting model selection.Sensitivity AnalysesSensitivity analyses were performed in which patients withoutconvalescent-phase samples were excluded and also in whichdifferent prior information were used [18].RESULTSThe ﬂow diagram in Figure 2 provides an overview of thestudy.

Of 2455 records from the 4 remaining datasets, 803 were excluded because they were duplicated in ≥1o fthe other studies (n = 641) or because not all of the intendedtests were undertaken (n= 162). Therefore, 4 data sets involv-ing 1652 patients were included in the analysis (Table 1)[ 2–5].Studies A and B were prospective observational studies con-ducted at a single hospital in Udon Thani, in northeastThailand, in which culture, MAT, and at least 1 additional test(PCR, lateral ﬂow test, or IFA) was undertaken in all cases.Studies C and D were prospective multicenter studies in whichculture and MAT were undertaken in all cases. All serologicaltests had been performed using paired samples, when available.The median duration of illness prior to admission was 4 days,and the median duration of illness prior to obtaining the con-valescent-phase serum sample was 14 days.We ﬁrst assumed that the combination of culture plus MATwas a perfect reference test (100% sensitivity and 100% speciﬁ-city). This gave an estimated prevalence for leptospirosis of36.9%, 24.0%, 24.8%, and 16.8% for studies A, B, C, and D, re-spectively. The sensitivity of culture alone was low and variedsigniﬁcantly among studies (28.5%, 28.6%, 15.4%, and 6.3% forstudies A, B, C, and D, respectively). The sensitivity of MATwas high but also varied signiﬁcantly among studies (86.9%,85.7%, 91.0%, and 96.2% for studies A, B, C, and D, respective-ly). PCR, the lateral ﬂow test, and IFA were found to have eitherlow sensitivity (55.5%, 87.6%, and 64.7%, respectively) or lowspeciﬁcity (82.5%, 70.5%, and 95.2%, respectively).Bayesian latent class models were then used to obtain anestimate of the accuracy of each diagnostic test, without theassumption that the reference test was perfect. In the ﬁrst stage,we deﬁned the best-ﬁtting Bayesian latent class model for eachdata set by determining the presence of correlations betweenantigenic tests (culture and PCR) and serological tests (MAT,IFA, and the lateral ﬂow test) (Appendix 3). The best-ﬁttingmodel for study A was the model that included correlationsbetween culture and PCR and between MAT and the lateralﬂow test. The best-ﬁtting model for study B was the modelthat included correlation between MAT and IFA. The modelwithout correlation between diagnostic tests was selected forstudies C and D because we did not expect a correlationbetween culture and MAT. Sensitivities and speciﬁcities ofculture, MAT, and culture plus MAT, estimated by Bayesianlatent class model for each study, are shown in Figure 3. Theseﬁndings formed the basis for choosing the model with correla-tion between culture and PCR, between MAT and the lateralﬂow test, and between MAT and IFA for the meta-analysis.Data across all 4 studies were then combined and analyzedusing a Bayesian latent class random-effects meta-analysismodel, which demonstrated that all of the estimated parame-ters were considerably different from those estimated whenculture plus MAT was assumed to be perfect. The meta-analysis model indicated that culture, MAT, and culture plusMAT had very low sensitivities of 10.5% (95% CrI, 2.7%–27.5%), 49.8% (95% CrI, 37.6%–60.8%), and 55.5% (95% CrI,42.9%–67.7%), respectively (Figure 3 and Table 2). The speci-ﬁcity of both MAT alone and of culture plus MAT was 98.8%(95% CrI, 92.8%–100%). This means that the prevalence ofleptospirosis estimated in each data set using the model wasmuch higher than if relying on culture plus MAT (eg, 57.4%vs 36.9% for study A). Of the 2 antigenic tests, PCR had thehighest sensitivity, at 52.7% (95% CrI, 45.2%–60.6%). Amongthe 3 serological tests, the lateral ﬂow test had the highestsensitivity, at 85.6% (95% CrI, 77.5%–93.2%). Because it ispossible that a combination of PCR and a serological testcould be used as point-of-care diagnostic tests for leptospiro-sis, using positive results of either test, the sensitivity andspeciﬁcity of PCR plus the lateral ﬂow test were calculated bythe model; these were 93.2% (95% CrI, 88.8%–96.9%) and93.1% (95% CrI, 84.1%–98.5%), respectively (Table 2).Sensitivity AnalysisSensitivity analysis was performed in which 555 of 1652 pa-tients (33.6%) without convalescent-phase samples wereexcluded. By use of a random-effects meta-analysis model, thesensitivities of MAT, the lateral ﬂow test, and IFA were esti-mated to be 70.3% (95% CrI, 44.1%–91.5%), 89.7% (95% CrI,80.3%–97.2%), and 71.2% (95% CrI, 52.4%–89.8%), respec-tively, for patients with leptospirosis who had a convalescent-phase sample. The accuracies of other diagnostic tests werenot substantially different from the above values, although allCrIs were wider as a consequence of the reduced informationFigure 1.

There was no substantial change whendifferent prior information was used (Appendix 4 [Supple-mentary Data]).DISCUSSIONThe key ﬁndings of this study are that the true sensitivities ofculture, MAT, and culture plus MAT are low. The ﬁnding thatculture has a low sensitivity is neither novel nor surprising,since Leptospira organisms are only present in the bloodduring the ﬁrst week of untreated infection, and isolation ofthis bacterium from clinical samples is technically demanding.Furthermore, our patient population may have consumedover-the-counter antibiotics prior to hospital presentation,which may have resulted in false-negative culture results. Theproportion of patients who had taken antibiotics by the timeof presentation in our studies is not known, but a study ofpatients presenting to a hospital in neighboring Laos showedthat 57% of patients who were admitted to Mahosot Hospitaland underwent investigations, including lumbar puncture, hadantimicrobial activity detected in their urine [20]. Other possi-ble explanations for the low sensitivity of culture are thatviable Leptospira species are difﬁcult to recover from clinicalsamples, using the existing culture methods. Of note, cultureswere maintained for at least 6 months before results weredeemed to be negative. More worrying is the low sensitivity ofMAT, since this is central to the case deﬁnition of deﬁnite lep-tospirosis and is widely used.There are several potential reasons why MAT had low sensi-tivity in our setting. Antibodies to Leptospira may take severalweeks to become detectable by MAT [21]. In the studies de-scribed here, the second (ie, convalescent-phase) serum samplewas collected at least 10 days after the start of symptoms thatwere attributed to leptospirosis, but it is possible that thisFigure 3.

This increase in sensitivity is consistent withexisting knowledge and is comparable to a previous estimate(76%), in which only patients with culture-conﬁrmed leptospi-rosis were considered [22]. However, this also suggests that anumber of patients with leptospirosis have a false-negative testresult by MAT even if a convalescent-phase sample is available.Other possible explanations for the low sensitivity of MAT arethat lipopolysaccharide from different Leptospira serovarsinduces a variable level of immune response and that the Leptos-pira serovars used in the MAT did not include 1 or more locallyimportant strains, although we have no evidence that this is thecase. The poor sensitivity of culture plus MAT in the real clini-cal setting, as shown by Bayesian latent class modeling, suggeststhat improvement of both tests or development of a new goldstandard test is required.Our data supported a positive correlation between bothantigenic tests (ie, culture and PCR), a ﬁnding that could be in-terpreted as meaning that results of both culture and PCR aremore likely to be positive if the burden of Leptospira organismsin blood is high and to be negative if the burden is low [2,23]. Apositive correlation was also found between serological tests (ie,between MAT and IFA and between MAT and the lateral ﬂowtest). These ﬁndings are consistent with existing knowledge.A major effect of poor sensitivity of the reference test is thatthe prevalence of leptospirosis is underestimated. The estimatedprevalence of leptospirosis for each study separately, as deter-mined by Bayesian latent class modeling (32.6%–57.4%), wasaround double that of previous estimates that used culture plusMAT as the gold standard (16.8%–36.9%). This is credible, since50% of our study patients with suspected leptospirosis left thehospital without a deﬁnite diagnosis following a test panel thatincluded bacterial culture; other serological tests, including thosefor rickettsial infections (which are also common in our setting);radiological tests; and detailed clinical evaluation [2–5]. Ourstudy suggests that leptospirosis may have been the cause of feverin a proportion of these cases.Evaluation of diagnostic tests when the accuracy of the goldstandard is unknown is an active area of biostatistical research,since the use of an imperfect gold standard to evaluate theaccuracy and clinical usefulness of an alternative test is ﬂawedand leads to biased results [8, 14, 17, 24]. Our study has dem-onstrated that culture plus MAT represents a relatively poorgold standard against which to compare alternative diagnostictests for leptospirosis and has shown the usefulness ofstatistical models under such circumstances. For example,PCR had a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 55.5% and 82.5%, re-spectively, when compared with culture plus MAT. When re-calculated using Bayesian latent class modeling, the sensitivityand speciﬁcity of PCR were 52.7% and 97.2%, respectively,representing a test with a high degree of speciﬁcity.Our study had several strengths, including the use of largeand individual-level data sets rather than summary estimatesfrom the published literature. Disparity of study characteristicsand risk of bias were comparatively low, since all studies wereconducted prospectively and by the same research unit. Noneof the studies were supported by diagnostic companies. In ad-dition, we used a random-effects model, a rigorous statisticalmethod that has been recommended by the Cochrane Diag-nostic Test Accuracy Working Group as the method of choicefor diagnostic meta-analyses [10].This study also has several limitations. Use of basic Bayesianlatent class models to estimate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity ofeach test in a population does not allow us to determine theeffects that symptom duration, antimicrobials received prior topresentation, and timing of convalescent-phase samples at thelevel of individual patients have on these parameters. Theseeffects could be evaluated in advanced Bayesian latent classmodels [25]. Correlation between IFA and the lateral ﬂow testcould not be evaluated because these tests were not performedtogether in any study included in the analysis. The small numberof studies included also meant that important study characteris-tics, including differences in the prevalence of leptospirosis, andthe level of reproducibility between studies of the ﬁnding of highaccuracy for PCR and the lateral ﬂow test were not assessed. Thecommercial lateral ﬂow test evaluated here had a published speci-ﬁcity that was underestimated, compared with the gold standard,but it is not currently available [26, 27]. The currently availablerapid serological tests for leptospirosis include a latex agglutina-tion test and an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay [28–30],neither of which has been evaluated by us to date.We conclude that our current reference testing strategy isimperfect. As a result, both the prevalence of leptospirosis innortheast Thailand and the accuracy of alternative diagnostictests have been underestimated. There is an urgent need forrapid serological tests for leptospirosis. Our ﬁndings supportthe use of latent class models to evaluate such a new testagainst an imperfect gold standard.Supplementary DataSupplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online(http://cid.oxfordjournals.org).
