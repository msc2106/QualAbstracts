ABSTRACT: 
The article focuses on the aftermath of the colour revolutions by analysing and questioning the real success, as often depicted by the West, of democracy promotion in the East European region. First of all, the article challenges the conventional logic of democracy promotion – even when backed by moral reasoning and resource availability – as sufficient and adequate for instigating democratic change in non-liberal regimes. By examining the case of Belarus it further contends that authoritarian regimes effectively learn to resist and counteract foreign-led democracy promotion, and often do so legitimately, with a minimal use of force. The article concludes that in order to exercise democracy promotion (if such a thing is possible at all) a far deeper understanding of autocratic narratives is needed, associated with a much closer look at societal norms and values, as well as an individual country's geopolitical resources and strategies.

Those who entice democratisation in theformer Soviet Union are yet to rip off the fruit of their actions . . .1The early 2000s witnessed a series of events which later became popularized as‘colour revolutions’.2 These public protests, which often adopted a colour as asymbol, included the ‘Rose Revolution’ in Georgia (2003), ‘Orange Revolution’in Ukraine (2004) and the ‘Tulip Revolution’ in Kyrgyzstan (2005).3 They werearguably successful in overthrowing previous authoritarian regimes and facilitatingdemocratic breakthroughs.4 Moreover, in their strikingly similar patterns, andinvolvement of Western non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as part of theinternational diffusion process, they all centred on elections as the key mechanismfor challenging the incumbency.ISSN 1351-0347 print/ISSN 1743-890X online# 2012 Taylor & Francishttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2012.641294http://www.tandfonline.com∗Email: ekk@aber.ac.ukDemocratizationVol. 19, No. 1, February 2012, 37–59Downloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 The ‘second generation’ of similar events (2005–2009), however, was unam-biguously less successful. In 2005–2006 revolutionary attempts were made acrossa number of states of the Former Soviet Union (Russia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan,Kazakhstan and Belarus), with comparable events initiated and equally failingelsewhere.5 Many of these undertakings were effectively thwarted before theyoccurred, and others were sweepingly suppressed, with a minimal use of force.This necessarily raises a question – which also opens up a wider debate on ‘democ-racy promotion’ in the region – whether the autocratic regimes have learned toresist and even counteract externally promoted ‘electoral revolutions’.There is no straightforward answer to this question. As some scholars observe,6for many autocratic regimes witnessing what were widely perceived as feignedrevolutionary activities in their neighbourhood, the urgency to learn to preventtheir subversive effect became realpolitik thus necessitating moderately oppressivetactics concomitant with open hostility to ‘rapacious Western interests’.7 However,regimes’ learning is only one side of the story, which would be incomplete withoutcontextualizing each ‘non-colour’ case with the purpose of understanding the real(far deeper) reasons behind the failed (foreign-led) revolutionary enticement.Belarus as ‘the last dictatorship in Europe’ serves as a curious testimony to theseuncanny logics of ‘democracy promotion’ and ‘autocratic diffusion’8 revealingits own and not-so-authoritarian narrative with which the ‘dictatorship’ withstoodits electoral turmoil in 2006.9On both the day itself and the day after the presidential election in March 2006,protestors took their discontent to the streets of Minsk, thus closely following theDemocratic Revolutionary Handbook.10 Prior to this, many young revolutionariestravelled as far afield as Serbia and Ukraine to learn about the strategies and tacticsof regime subversion to be applied in their own home. This consequently resultedin a 10,000-strong public protest on the day of the election,11 a five-day campresistance under physically and emotionally strenuous conditions, occasionalclashes with riot police, and over 1000 arrests in the aftermath of the event.12 Inother words, the prerequisites to galvanize an ‘electoral revolution’ were evidentlypresent in Belarus, but somehow failed to develop into a wider mass mobilization,despite the fact that the majority of Belarusians (70%), according to an IISEPSopinion poll,13 were aware of and even discussed the event with their closefriends and relations. This surprising public withdrawal from allegedly a‘people’s event’ is even more surprising when we consider the relatively moderateuse of violence by authorities (including their actions prior to and during theevent),14 and the feeble and often embarrassing attempts of the state media toconceal the reality.15 In other words, contrary to the anticipated draconianmeasures of Lukashenko’s dictatorship, only limited (and largely non-violent)state interference was used to counteract insurgencies.In the light of the revolutionary ‘contagion’ and seemingly propitious con-ditions for popular mobilization, why did the Belarusians not rise up against the‘outpost of tyranny’? Evidently, the country was as far away from a ‘tippingpoint’ of political change as a ‘revolutionary situation’ could be without its38 E. KorostelevaDownloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 constitutive elements: a people’s desire to rise and governors’ inability to rule.16Interestingly, this kind of ‘controversy’ of allegedly people’s revolutions is notsolely attributable to the ‘exceptional’ case of Belarus; instead, it appears to bebroadly illustrative of far deeper problems related to ‘democracy promotion’ and‘autocratic resilience’ in the region.17 In this article I limit myself to an analysisof nuances of the 2006 attempt at democracy promotion in Belarus. I focus onefforts by the anti-regime opposition, encouraged by the West. I also seek toexplain the government’s response to it. In what follows, I will first discuss thelimitations of the precarious ‘international diffusion’ model that has explicitlydominated the debate on ‘colour revolutions’, and will offer some counter-pointspremised on Lane’s argument of ‘revolutionary coup d’e´tat’.18 In the second partof this article, I will examine Way’s theory of structural factors19 in order toevaluate the Belarusian response to colour revolutions in more detail. The ‘struc-tural factors’ perspective, here interpreted more broadly, is not only essential forunderstanding the reasons of success/failure of the recent attempt at ‘internationaldiffusion’ in Eastern Europe, but also for far deeper understanding of why demo-cratization by Western design may not necessarily succeed in the region, despitethe perceived leverage of or linkage with the West.20 Finally (and by way ofconclusion) I will discuss the relevance of legitimacy that underpins Lukashenko’sregime thus alluding to a possible counterintuitive ‘balance’ between publiclyperceived societal needs and values, and respective government performance,the understanding of which somewhat shifts the focus of ‘democracy promotion’from the impatient ‘when’ to the improbable ‘if’, thus questioning whetherexternal democracy promotion may succeed in Eastern Europe and elsewhere bysimilar means.International diffusion or revolutionary coup d’e´tat?Much of the recent literature written on colour revolutions focuses on ‘internationaldiffusion’ as a mechanism of emulating successful narratives of ‘democracypromotion’ in the region – through training and sharing ideas and resources todirect involvement – with the intention to overthrow existing autocraticregimes.21 This scholarship has been particularly influential in debating successfulinternational diffusion (after the trials in Southern Europe in the late 1990s) inthe recent ‘colour’ cases of Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. Yet it appears farless comprehensive for dealing with those less victorious stories that by fardominate the ‘second tide’ of the ‘colour revolutions’ from 2005 onwards, andtherefore needs closer examination in order to understand why some ‘revolutions’fail and ‘how Western policy misses the mark’.22According to Bunce and Wolchik, ‘diffusion can be defined as a processwherein new ideas, institutions, policies, models or repertoires of behaviourspread geographically . . . whether within a given state or across states’.23 In thecase of Eastern Europe, it refers to ‘an electoral model of democratisation’ thatwas developed in Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia between 1996 and 1998, andDemocratization 39Downloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 in Serbia in 2000, whereby trained opposition activists use fraudulent elections tomobilize popular support to defeat weak autocratic incumbents.By aiming to introduce ‘democracy from below’, all these revolutionary activi-ties shared a common strategy: targeting the removal of incumbency through massprotests occurring within a constitutional framework (non-violent), focusing onallegedly fraudulent electoral procedures and drawing on young and enthusiasticactivists to form the core for mobilizing larger crowds by conventional and othermeans, including popular entertainment and modern technology (use of mobilephones, internet and media resources).24Furthermore, as Bunce and Wolchik assert,25 in order to make internationaldiffusion ‘available for possible export’, a set of three factors should be met.First of all, potential revolutionaries need to closely follow the electoral model,which offers a range of strategies and tactics as to how to topple the incumbentregime26; second, the importing countries should have similar conditions – ‘putsuccinctly, common contexts and common identities’; and finally, there shouldexist ‘collaborative networks’ that ‘cross the boundaries’ and ‘provide incentivesfor actors on both sides of the diffusion process to embrace transplantation’.27The relevance of the third factor for ‘democracy promotion’ in the region, andespecially for the occurrence of ‘the colour revolutions’, should not be underesti-mated,28 as it has essentially – through the provision of logistical, intellectual andfinancial resources – been the driving force of international diffusion in EasternEurope. Open and unabashed exposure of Western involvement and sponsorship– being part of these ‘collaborative networks’ – were indisputably a key featureof regional democracy promotion. International NGOs and aid organizationswere particularly instrumental for the promotion and organization of large-scaleentertainment events including payments to the attendees themselves.29 As Waycontends:Transnational networks of previously successful activists, with assistance from theUS Agency for International Development (USAID) and other organisations aswell as from experts in non-violent protest such as Gene Sharp, are credited with sti-mulating transitions in countries that lacked sufficient prerequisites for revolution andwhere the fall of autocrats was ‘not predicated by most analysts’.30Drawing on the scale and arguable success of the first electoral revolutions inGeorgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, and their repetitive character, some scholarseven suggested conceptualizing them as an instance of modular development pre-mised on the imitation or indeed emulation of ‘the prior successful example ofothers’.31 In Beissinger’s interpretation, for example, all these revolutionary activi-ties should not be viewed as independent cases, ‘but rather [as] an interrelatedmodular phenomenon in which opposition groups borrowed frames, strategies,repertoires, and even logos from previously successful efforts and gained inspi-ration from the acts of others’.32 He further insists that if all structural advantagesof the electoral revolutions are taken into account there may be further anticipation40 E. KorostelevaDownloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 of electoral uprisings in the region based on the electoral cycles of the existingregimes.33Yet there are a number of reasons to believe that modular diffusion has run itscourse in the region, and even more, that its allegedly successful first trials clearlyfailed to produce any noticeable change of regime, let alone to achieve democra-tization.34 On reflection, it becomes apparent that while these ‘revolutions’ mayhave been legitimated in democratic terms by involving some ‘staged’ massactivities, they should be more appropriately termed not as ‘people’s events’, butinstead as ‘revolutionary coup d’e´tat’35 aided by Western sponsorship. These‘colour cases’, as Lane asserts further, ‘were more than palace putsches but theywere not classical revolutions’,36 either in their intentions or their outcome.They did involve some mass mobilization but they did not produce any system/regime change. Instead, what seems to have occurred is the instalment of newpolitical incumbents instigated through the agency of mass popular support andWestern orchestration.37These electoral revolutions, especially those of the second (2005–2009) gen-eration, which Chaulia suitably depicted as ‘political convulsions’38 have evidentlyfailed to take into account domestic circumstances (including the precariouslegitimacy) of some existing autocracies, and instead focused on maximizing‘electoral opportunities’ in a situation when oppositional forces explicitlystruggled or indeed were unable to mobilize public support for a legitimate transferof power. As David Lane qualifies it further:What is portrayed in the media as ‘people’s power’ is in reality an elite manipulateddemonstration. While the masses may be captivated by euphoric revolutionary ideol-ogy, they are in political terms instrumentalities of indigenous counter elites, oftenencouraged by foreigners with their own agendas. If successful, rather than such revo-lutions leading to significant socio-political change, a circulation of elites follows theousting of former rulers or their cooption into a new elite structure.39This is precisely what happened as a result of the first ‘wave’ of colour takeovers:not a regime change but a change of governing elite in countries like Georgia,Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan now being popularly associated with anarchy, corruptionand new forms of authoritarianism.40 On the contrary, the ‘second generation’of colour changeovers has managed to maintain the existing status quo thusresisting (with a minimal use of force) the temptation of externally orchestratedrevolutions. Belarus offers a particularly striking example of how the ‘revolution-ary contagion’ failed to mobilize the masses, and exposes the need to explore theroots of public ‘inertia’ with reference to regime legitimacy and societal values –the principal focus of this article.Interestingly, in many cases of ‘revolutionary coup d’e´tat’ of the second gener-ation especially – that is, involving mass protest but no system change per se41 – asingle crucial element was clearly missing – that of ‘domestic receptivity’.42Without considering each case individually it is difficult to generalize whether‘lacking [legitimate] domestic partners’43 was essentially due to pre-emptiveDemocratization 41Downloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 actions by the autocratic regimes, or more broadly, due to the indigenous conditions(including structural and psychological predispositions of the population) unsuita-ble for making revolutions. In either circumstance, a simple wisdom related to thepromotion of internal change through manipulation of societal norms and values –Nye’s formula44 – which was placed at the heart of the US-led ‘colour revolutions’in Eastern Europe45 was evidently wrong-handled here. In his earlier work Nyeexplicitly claimed that only those ‘countries that are closest to global norms ofliberalism, pluralism, and autonomy; those with the most access to multiple chan-nels of communication; and those whose credibility is enhanced by their domesticand international performance’46 are likely to gain from international diffusion, inundertaking their (r)evolutionary change. The countries of the second generation of‘colour democratic breakthroughs’, no matter how advantageous their electoralopportunitiesmay have been, evidently failed tomeet these criteria thus underliningthe importance of contextualizing ‘democracy promotion’ for each given case, andconsidering structural factors propitious or otherwise for undertaking regimechange with external assistance. In the meantime, following the commentary ofRIA-Novosti, one needs to emphasize that ‘presidential elections in Belarus, andtheir aftermath, showed that “orange” technologies may be applicable even inBelarusian conditions, but they may not necessarily be effective’.47Structural factors: regime’s learning curveContrary to the wisdom of ‘external democracy promotion’, Way argues that ‘dif-fusion may explain fewer aspects of recent postcommunist revolutions than issometimes argued’.48 What matters instead are the structural factors that lay foun-dations for any possible change to occur, and which may eventually develop into arevolutionary situation, with de-legitimation of the incumbent authority. Experien-cing international ‘contagion’ on one’s doorstep and having domestic revolution-aries trained in accordance with theDemocratic Revolutionary Handbook49 are notsufficient ‘ingredients’ to initiate a revolution a` la carte. Way asserts that ‘revolu-tions have often failed even when oppositions have adopted the “right” strategiesfrom abroad. The most striking case is Belarus, which garnered serious attentionand input from Serb, Slovak, Ukrainian, and other activists in the run-up to the2006 presidential elections’.50 He emphasized that ‘Lukashenka’s opponentsseemed to do everything they were supposed to and arguably followed the“model” much more faithfully [than their counterparts]. Yet no large-scalesupport materialized, and Lukashenka never came close to being unseated’.51Instead, as Way authoritatively contends, it is the structural factors that play afar more decisive role in explaining ‘why some postcommunist authoritarianregimes have been more vulnerable than others to opposition threats’.52 In particu-lar, Way singles out two broad categories of structural factors that may explain thedynamics of recent electoral turnovers: (i) the strength of a country’s ties with theWest; and (ii) the strength of the incumbent regime’s autocratic party or state.Evidently, it was the ‘lame-duck’ effect of the incumbency combined with actively42 E. KorostelevaDownloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 exercised Western leverage over the country that led to the toppling of the previousautocratic regimes in Georgia and Ukraine, under the well-organized activitiesof the opposition. In countries where the leadership enjoys solid structuralsupport including psychological predispositions of the population (for example,Belarus), little can be done externally, in order to stage full scale mobilizationand revolutionary change:Lukashenka’s success at remaining in power has less to do with any particularstrategies adopted in response to postcommunist revolutions than with his alreadyoverwhelming domination over the opposition.53In other words, although revolution may have been attempted in Belarus in 2006,arguably at the behest of the West, the endeavour clearly yielded no ‘revolutionarysituation’ there, thus highlighting the relevance of structural factors propitious(or otherwise) for democratization.Pre-emptive authoritarianismIn Belarus’ case, limited linkage with the West (partly instigated by the Westitself)54 and long-term pre-emptive actions of Lukashenko’s government madethe ‘colour revolution’ in Belarus destined to fail. The concept of ‘pre-emptiveauthoritarianism’ was well developed by Vital Silitski55 to underline theregime’s learning ability to survive by adopting preventative measures tocombat the democratic contagion. Over the 15 years of its struggle for survivalLukashenko’s regime has naturally perfected the policy of pre-emption and,more importantly, is constantly learning to survive by emulating consensusbetween the regime’s performance and perceived societal needs.56 There is aplethora of instruments that the regime can deploy – from institutional throughto cultural, ideological, tactical and other structural tools – in order to enhanceits survival skills and public satisfaction, while also learning to strike first.It is correct to insist that over the years Lukashenko’s regime has mastered anunlimited grip on power by actively utilizing principles and instruments ofpre-emption, and prepared well to meet the challenges of regional democratic con-tagion. In brief,57 institutionally, to ensure legality and stability of his authority,Lukashenko has (i) re-written the constitution thus acquiring unlimited powers(including legislative), and removing restrictions on his stay in office; (ii) elimi-nated noncompliant elements of society, either by legally limiting the scope fortheir activities, through fear/intimidation, or by removing them physically fromthe scene (as in the infamous political disappearances of 1999–2001), thus enhan-cing the perceived efficacy of his government; (iii) installed new structural pillars(presidential vertical; police/armed forces) to exercise minimal coercion whennecessary; and (iv) altered the format of other institutions (parliament; educationalestablishments; civil society; etc.) to act in unison with presidential propaganda.Culturally, he has (i) defeated the nationalism of the Belarusian Popular Front,which was a driving force for independence in the neighbouring Baltic states,Democratization 43Downloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 becoming associated instead with a new type of nationalism building on a post-transitional identity and the relative economic stability of the country; (ii)removed from circulation any symbolic reminders of the pre-Soviet identity(flag, literature, the use of Belarusian language for teaching); and instead (iii) pro-moted Soviet/state patriotism and its relevant symbolic manifestations to boostpublic nostalgia for the Soviet ‘nanny’ state; and (iv) inculcated public awarenessof Lukashenko’s Belarus, vividly embodied by the slogans of his election cam-paigns ‘For Belarus’ (2001) and ‘For Independent Belarus’ (2006) which in theeyes of many is an oasis of stability, security and equal opportunities. Ideologically,he has (i) launched a concept of egalitarian state nationalism drawing on ‘threeessential pillars: Belarus uniqueness, unity and sovereignty’58; (ii) re-introducedideological education and propaganda in workplaces; (iii) actively promoted therise of BPSM (Belaruski Republikanski Sayuz Moladzi – Belarusian RepublicanUnion of Youth) by making its membership a tacit requirement for entry to higheducation; and (iv) supported the activities of Belaya Rus, a popular social move-ment staffed with Lukashenko’s supporters, as a potential foundation for buildingthe Party of Power, as/where necessary. Tactically, not only has Lukashenko (i) lit-erally and otherwise decapitated, discredited and demobilized the opposition byforcing them into their self-exile or indeed ghettoizing them into a manageablecompound; he has also (ii) learned to legally, militarily and ideologically quellpublic unrest by initiating a number of laws that would thwart public mobilizationin the making.59 Finally, international pre-emption has included Lukashenko’sjoining the non-aligned states60 in 2006 to withstand the pressure of the West,and continuously seeking Russia’s (and the Commonwealth of IndependentStates’ (CIS)) political backing61 in order to ensure his ‘international’ legitimacy.In other words, by learning to act first, largely owing to the country’s relativeeconomic stability and popular legitimacy of the president, Lukashenko’s regimehas developed an enviable immunity to democratic change, associated with thewave of coloured revolutions in the neighbourhood.62Anti-revolutionary measuresHowever, this is not to contend that Lukashenko’s regime did not take any immedi-ate precautionary measures in order to ensure that the government would survivethe potential turmoil of colour revolutions. On the contrary, actions to prevent‘orange contagion’ in Belarus were well calculated and painstakingly followedthrough, thus turning Lukashenko’s statement that ‘there will be no rose,orange, or banana revolution in Belarus’63 into a categorical imperative for thegovernment to act promptly and to be in full control of the situation. Earlyprecautionary measures included intensified state propaganda through ‘countlessreports, documentaries, propaganda broadcasts, and newspaper articles toexplain to the population the official take on the revolutions’.64 Particularlyinfluential in setting the popular anti-revolutionary mood were TV broadcastsincluding controversial documentaries Spiritual War and Conspirology by Yury44 E. KorostelevaDownloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 Azarionok, portraying the battle between the president and the opposition ‘boughtout by the West’. More subtle productions included a series of documentariesBelarus: The Look from Outside and Fifteen reviewing social and economicdevelopments in the former Soviet Union and beyond, and praising the achieve-ments of Lukashenko’s government.65 Pop-propaganda66 also intensified in theform of mass concerts and other entertainment (street parades, sports events,harvest festivals) delivering images of green-and-red ‘flag-waving’ happycrowds and official establishment faces mingling with commoners to counteractthe effect of orange or any other revolutionary colour used in the neighbourhoodto entice the public: for example, a technique also effectively deployed by Nazar-baev in Kazakhstan to counteract revolution.67Furthermore, early precautions also included some ‘hard measures’, forexample, by putting a considerable part of the Belarusian army onto a full securityalert. In particular, following the Kyrgyz events, in March 2005, the presidentrequested full military mobilization of the 28 battalion in Baranovichi (nearMinsk), and additionally recalled 2000 reserve troops into military action.68Security forces also intensified their input in the struggle against the colourrevolution. Notably, in December 2005 the KGB, which still functions underthe same infamous name in Belarus, issued a document titled ‘Analyticalreport on colour revolutions: a possible scenario for Belarus’, prepared for disse-mination in the House of Representatives for the MPs to ‘work’ with theirrespective constituencies in order to prevent the occurrence of unrest. As KGBchairman General Stephan Sukhorenko commented on 2 December 2005: ‘Wehave sufficient information to disseminate to our deputies, so that they canprepare their electors and inform them of our understanding of the situation’.69The analytical report contained detailed information on how colour revolutionsoccurred in the region (paying particular attention to Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan),who organized them and how precisely they were staged in order to overthrowexisting governments. According to the report, a revolution would be staged tofollow four crucial steps in order to achieve leadership replacement: from facil-itating popular perception of incumbency as tyrannical to exposing elections asfraudulent and demanding justice by taking people’s protest to the streets. Thereport also offered some details of the possible toppling of Lukashenko’sregime and what precautionary measures needed be taken in order to preventsuch activities.70On the eve of the presidential election, on 19 March 2006, every mobile phoneuser in Minsk received a text message cautioning against attending demonstrationsorganized by the opposition, and suggesting that all participants of unlawfulprotests would be ‘severely battered’.71 A day earlier General Sukhovenko pub-licly announced that all participants of unauthorized public actions during orafter the election would be charged under the Terrorist Act and could be subjectto 20 years imprisonment. He further insisted that the KGB discovered a secretplot involving the opposition staging protests against the president and evenpossible detonation of four schools in the capital during/after the election.72Democratization 45Downloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 The official propaganda went into full swing on the day of the election andthereafter: the official media distributed fabricated images of homosexuals anddrug addicts, and even alleged that contagious diseases were spreading inOctober Square where the tents were staged.73 The spin continued after thecrackdown on the demonstrators: the official media broadcast pictures of riotpolicemen and official TV crews violently beaten by opposition supporters andhospitalized with severe head and chest injuries. Furthermore, according toWilson,74 ‘Lukashenko’s “technologists” added the anti-Polish element andsuccessfully demonised Milinkevich [the then leader of the united opposition]as a stooge of the Vatican and Warsaw kresy75 – politics, as well as the USA.Milinkevich’s popularity in foreign capitals was therefore a double-edged sword.’On the day of the election, in order to handle the prospect of civilian disquiet,Lukashenko recalled to full alert 110,000 paramilitary forces (especially to handlethe aftermath of the election), including OMON, a special force branch, whichwere further supplemented by a significant number of reserves, and a newly estab-lished special police force led by Colonel Dmitry Pavlichenko, who was allegedlyinvolved in commanding ‘death squads’ aimed at murdering Lukashenko’sprominent opponents. Furthermore, as reported by other sources,76 Lukashenko’spersonal bodyguard force was activated to include about 200 enlisted men,‘specially trained and equipped with cutting edge technology’,77 and selected ongrounds of personal loyalty to the president. Additionally, a powerful and highlysecretive SWAT team, ‘Alma’, belonging to the Ministry of Interior and paramili-tary quick reaction squad SOBR were on full alert to counteract any insurgence.None of the above forces, however, was deployed (or even seen on the streets),except for Colonel Dmitry Pavlichenko’s squad used to disband the demonstrationof a few thousand people led by Kozulin during Freedom Day on 25 March 2006.Nevertheless, protestors still faced paramilitary batons and the threat of rubberbullets, allegedly fired at some by Pavlichenko’s brigade from carabines C-23‘Selezen’ designed for shooting with rubber bullets and gas.78This was the only occasion where the state used moderate force to counteractcivic unrest. There were other ‘localized’ and small-scale clashes with the parami-litary police, however, generally speaking, public demonstrations (including thedisbursement of the tent city) were handled in a moderately peaceful manner bythe authorities and paramilitary forces (some of which – especially the Pavli-chenko squad – were known for their extreme brutality and violence).This relatively mild and controlled response from the authorities to hithertounprecedented (for Belarus) levels of public protest was quite unexpected, thustaking the opposition by surprise. The Russian media subsequently commentedthat ‘Batska’s [Nation’s Father] opponents awaited brutal oppression of theprotests: they had been warned about this in advance . . . However, there was animpression that neither Kozulin, nor Milinkevich was ready for this peaceful reac-tion, and could not handle the crowds sensibly’.79 Apparently, ‘militia behavedreservedly, no OMON forces were seen on the square, and although threatened,no armoured military vehicles with water guns were deployed either’.80 Some46 E. KorostelevaDownloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 observers noted that despite Batska’s quite emotional personality,81 the authoritiesstayed in control of the ‘revolutionary situation’ in Belarus by integrating all theirresources (from military readiness to the effective use of state propaganda) into acoordinated response to thwart political unrest in the making:Belarus has demonstrated a relatively new phenomenon for the post-soviet space –how to counteract a planned but unaccomplished revolution. . .The state and civilsociety in Belarus were too robust to be subverted by the political crisis developingon its doorsteps.82Therefore, there was nothing surprising in Lukashenko’s ‘elegant and convincing’victory in presidential election83 and his peaceful curbing of the planned but failedelectoral revolution in the country.What was surprising instead was the limited use of coercion and violence inthese clearly volatile and nerve-racking circumstances for the autocratic leadershipin the region. One commentator noted: ‘In order to defeat Lukashenko, hisopponents need to learn to win heart and minds not only of intelligentsia, business-men and students, but also of someone like tetia Natasha. . .[who said] “Of course Ivoted for Lukashenko. Because we are now used to him. He is not new, and life hasactually become more stable with him.”’84Why was an authoritarian response NOT necessary in Belarus?Accounting for domestic structural factors thus not only elicits some generalexplanation of why revolutions fail or succeed in the region and beyond, butalso suggests the need to ‘contextualize’ democracy promotion in order to under-stand the regime’s endurance and its logic for survival in each ‘non-colour’ case.There is little doubt that Lukashenko’s government has used all its resources tobuild a regime, which many would describe as ‘legitimate’, that is, enjoyingextensive public support.85 Through autocratic suppression, institutional meansof prevention, government economic performance, active propaganda and agrowing sense of cultural identity amongst the Belarusians – identity masteredby the president – Lukashenko has managed to achieve an enviable balancebetween his government and the Belarusians at large, expressed through publicendorsement of his regime. People now evaluate his and others’ performance(that of home-grown opposition and of governments in their neighbourhood)through the actions (and the outcome these actions entail – usually of order andstability) of their own president, with lasting and largely negative perceptions ofany external or internal challenges for the incumbency.86 It would be absolutelytrue to say that the specificity of Lukashenko’s regime lies with (i) his ownactions that he clearly directed to safeguard his authority over the years, includingachieving relative economic stability in the country; and more crucially, (ii) withhis own electorate which proved to be so malleable for responding to Lukashenko’sleadership, and thus generating the most enduring feature of his regime – itsDemocratization 47Downloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 genuine legitimacy: ‘rule is legitimate when its subjects believe it to be so’.87 Asour 2011 post-election nationwide survey indicates, Lukashenko still remainspopular (44% – four times greater than all other candidates) among the generalpopulation – that is, despite the bloody aftermath of the December 2010presidential election, and the imprisonment of almost all the presidentialcandidates.88In this section I will briefly explore what makes Lukashenko’s regime legiti-mate – the people/president bond, which naturally reduces the need for theregime to utilize state coercion extensively. More broadly, I will also examinethe normative foundations of the Belarusian society that have made Lukashenko’sphenomenon possible and even flourishing in Belarusian conditions.Regime’s legitimacyLukashenko is and will remain absolutely legitimate if people continue to identifywith him and appreciate his relatively successful social and economic policiesdirected at supporting communal well-being, security and stability.89 Popularperception that, in a situation of total collapse, the country could only be savedby the president – rather than any other existing or possible agency – clearlymakes the regime unwaveringly stable.Belarus, like many other countries, has been hit hard by the economic crisis, butthe effects of the global economic downturn have not yet fully resonated with thesociety at large, and many still feel stable and secure under Lukashenko’s leader-ship.90 Over a third of the polled population still believe that the state of theeconomy in Belarus is sound; with another 43% feeling neutral towards theoverall economic performance of their country.91 Over two thirds of the populationstate that their family income is relatively stable (67%) and a healthy pluralityobserve (46%) that it has not changed in the past year, with another 24% evendeclaring a slight improvement.On balance, more people believe (over 60%) that the country is stable anddeveloping in the right direction (as against 24% who think otherwise). Overall,about 40% of the respondents perceive their president’s actions as complete orrather satisfactory, with another third feeling neutral or hesitant, which serves asa clear sign of the continuity of the president’s legitimacy in Belarus in 2011.Furthermore, if one were to choose between economic well-being and democ-racy/independence, well-being comes first: almost 70% (as against 22%) concurwith the importance of the former. Therefore, people’s positive preferences forLukashenko come as no surprise: due to the relative efficacy of his regime andhis convincing political discourse, he continues to remain the sole alternative onthe Belarusian political landscape.Why do people vote for Lukashenko? In 200892 they simply believed thathe was successful in restoring order in society (66.3%), in building an indepen-dent and economically viable state (64.5%), in promoting collaboration withinthe CIS (60.1%), in not letting the ‘oligarchs’ rule the country (59.7%), and in48 E. KorostelevaDownloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 fighting crime (58.9%) and corruption (49.6%). In comparison with Soviettimes, people (08/2006) also see the incumbent authority as ‘close to thepeople’ (30.4%), less bureaucratic (25.5%), strong and reliable (23.6%) aswell as lawful (23.2%).Moreover, people seem to identify with their president knowingly – that is,despite being aware of government corruption, allegations of political murder,media manipulation and the absolute power the president has (including beingabove the law) in the country. This conscious choice of the Belarusians remainsa mystery to many students of politics. How can Belarusians knowingly identifyand support Lukashenko’s regime – in many eyes, an oppressive, murderous,and by many accounts, a stupefying order?Common sense and logic suggest that indeed what Belarusians seem to treasuremost is their personal security, given the legacies of the past instability andhardship – personal security above newly attained sovereignty and personal free-doms and rights. This is duly reflected in their ‘strategic choice’ of leadership.Belarusians ‘have bread and butter’ daily on the table, they are in full employmentwith regularly paid wages and pensions;93 they are lavishly entertained by the state,and cared for through various (although limited) social benefits. They have madetheir choice of leadership because this government does not abuse/harass themindividually, and because they know that in the absence of any eligible alternative,Lukashenko is their best bet.Being different?There is however more to this ‘strategic choice’ of leadership. This kind of prefer-ence for strong, orderly and authoritarian government seems common for manyEast European transient states vulnerable to change and desiring stability, andhas far deeper roots – going well beyond pre-emptive actions of the regimeitself – in society.94 As our research indicates,95 many countries of the formerSoviet Union demonstrate an enduring proclivity for strong leadership andadherence to other-than-liberal values – those of community, tolerance, culturalheritage, etc. as opposed to democracy, lawfulness and human rights – whichinvariably make them different and so less susceptible to values and ideals of theliberal democracy, as practised by the West.Interestingly, the normative disjunction between the West and the formerSoviet Union96 is not simply an intellectual contestation, or a projected discourseof autocratic governments in an attempt to justify their authoritarian policies. Asthe absolute majority of the respondents in many case studies indicated, this isdeeply rooted in public perceptions whereby people clearly and uncompromisinglydifferentiate between Western values – of market economy, human rights,democracy and lawfulness – and their own values – of peace, tolerance, respectfor cultural heritage and religion.97This naturally leads to questioning the overall logic of democracy promotionby the West, which is often premised on the normative acquis of liberalDemocratization 49Downloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 democracies and their respective vested interests.98 As Lane contends: ‘Westerninterests are involved in these processes – in support of groups, in MargaretThatcher’s terms, “with whom we can do business”, or from a geo-strategicpoint of view, to change allegiances in favour of the West’.99 The logical questionsare (i) that of mutual reciprocity and indeed receptivity – that is, whether there isany common normative denominator between the aiding and the receiving sides –and (ii) whether one set of arguably more virtuous values can be successfullyinstalled in those societies which for generations have followed a different (andoften contested) path of democratic development – the path premised on differentvalues and in many cases evincing a legitimate consensus between the people andtheir government.A new scholarship is now emerging to contest the concept of liberal democracyand democracy promotion per se,100 which insists on exposing not only the posi-tive but also the negative forms and practices of democracy, and on the need topluralize and contextualize democracy in each given case. It is to be hoped thatthis will engender a better understanding of why some transition countries mayresist generous and gratuitous aid, and may even find some Western efforts offen-sive in their attempt to change what may be externally seen as ‘rogue’ or an‘outpost of tyranny’, but internally, for what it is worth, is a perceivably legitimateorder for many people in the other-than-liberal states.ConclusionsIn this article the experience of the colour revolutions in Eastern Europe, andBelarus in particular, has been examined. In the light of the continuing politicalturmoil and in some cases, an increased authoritarian clampdown on genuinenon-confrontational forms of civic activities in the region, we have questionedthe real success of the first colour revolutions in bringing about political change,let alone democratization. The all-colour endeavours in Georgia, Ukraine andKyrgyzstan, and later on in many more countries of the former Soviet Union,may have been democratic in their mobilization, but they evidently failed towield any system change and thus can be more suitably theorized as ‘revolutionarycoup d’e´tat’, intending leadership replacement with some public support to ensurelegitimacy of the ‘new order’. ‘These revolutionary coup d’e´tats . . . involve the riseof different elite groups, clans or families, which seek to redistribute the assets ofthe previous regime’101 and are duly promoted by theWest, as those ‘whomwe cando business with’.102The colour revolutions clearly demonstrated that international diffusion of theforeign-led revolutionary experience in the region, even if underpinned by animpressive financial backing and enthusiastic training of the revolutionaries, isan insufficient and inadequate tool to instigate change in Eastern Europe.103Acareful account of domestic structural factors is needed in order to understandwhy so many colour revolutions, of the second generation (2005–2009) especially,have failed to materialize into democratic breakthroughs. Furthermore, it has been50 E. KorostelevaDownloaded by [Yale University Library] at 14:41 28 February 2012 insisted that both pluralization of the meaning of democracy and the contextualiza-tion of democracy promotion in each given case is essential in order to evaluate thereadiness for and the willingness of change by a particular regime, and what kind ofchange in actual fact is desired.Belarus has undermined theWestern ‘logic’ of democracy promotion premisedon templates and sponsorship, and by many accounts, offered a relatively conven-tional authoritarian ‘response’ to the attempted revolution on its doorsteps. Theregime has evidently learned (through long- and short-term measures) how todefend itself and, more remarkably, it has developed skills of how to do so legiti-mately, without resorting to extensive coercion, so often anticipated from the ‘out-posts of tyranny’. The article has argued that Belarusian authorities, by undertakingcertain immediate precautionary measures during the presidential election inMarch 2006, managed to maintain the status quo in a relatively peaceful andnon-aggressive manner.104 Effective learning by regimes, however, is only oneside of the story, which would be incomplete without analysis of the internal(domestic) conditions that created the propitious environment for the survivaland endurance of the Lukashenko regime.It has been argued that the incumbency in Belarus is unmistakably premised onthe precarious legitimacy that gives Lukashenko’s regime an enviable immunityand had effectively conditioned public withdrawal from the attempts at electoralmobilization during elections. The origin of this legitimacy is many-fold and notleast dependent on the efficacy of the regime and its deliverables. However, theessential part of the governing consensus has nevertheless been deeply rooted inthe historical/traditional values of the society itself, the manifestation of whichhas been so perplexingly well epitomized by Lukashenko himself. Therefore, inorder to exercise democracy promotion effectively (if such a thing is at all possible)a far deeper understanding of autocratic narratives is needed, concomitant with amuch closer analysis of local societal norms and values as well as of a country’sgeopolitical resources and strategies.AcknowledgementI wish to record my gratitude to the ESRC (RES-061-25-0001) for the financial support ofmy project, and the anonymous referees for their comments on the earlier version of thisarticle.
