ABSTRACT: 
The widespread distribution in Papua New Guinea of obsidian stemmed tools dated to the mid-Holocene has led scholars to postulate the existence of large interaction spheres. A newly reported artifact from Biak Island, West Papua provides the stimulus for reconsidering the role of this tool type in regional social interaction. The tool was hammer-dressed, a technique unknown for obsidian flaked tools elsewhere in the world and only rarely applied to obsidian artifacts in Melanesia. This new find closely resembles hammer-dressed obsidian stemmed tools from Garua Island, Papua New Guinea, but these are characterized by LA/ICPMS, PIXE-PGME, and INAA to the local Baki and Kutau-Bao obsidian sources in New Britain, Papua New Guinea, whereas the Biak tool is sourced to outcrops on Lou Island in Manus Province, Papua New Guinea. Hypotheses for functional, symbolic, and social roles of hammer-dressing are explored and evaluated on the basis of replication experiments and use-wear analyses. We argue that the complex and exceptionally rare technologies used for manufacturing hammer-dressed stemmed tools and applied to obsidian acquired from two widely separated obsidian sources substantially add to previous evidence for wide-scale social interaction during the mid-Holocene. The existence of these social networks might also have provided a mechanism for the rapid, extensive spread of innovations like Austronesian languages or Lapita pottery.

 Mid-Holocene Social Interaction in Melanesia:New Evidence from Hammer-Dressed ObsidianStemmed ToolsROBIN TORRENCE, PAMELA SWADLING, NINA KONONENKO,WALLACE AMBROSE, PIP RATH, AND MICHAEL D. GLASCOCKintroductionProposals that large-scale interaction and ceremonial exchange in thePaciﬁc region began during the time of Lapita pottery (c. 3300–2000 b.p.) (e.g.,Friedman 1981; Hayden 1983; Kirch 1997; Spriggs 1997) are seriously challengedby the extensive areal distribution of a class of retouched obsidian artifacts datedto the early and middle Holocene (c. 10,000–3300 b.p.) and known as ‘‘stemmedtools’’ (Araho et al. 2002). Find spots of obsidian stemmed tools stretch frommainland New Guinea to Bougainville Island and include the Trobriand Islands,various islands in Manus province, New Britain and New Ireland (Araho et al.2002; Golson 2005; Specht 2005; Swadling and Hide 2005) (Fig. 1). Althoughother forms of tanged and waisted stone tool are known in Melanesia (e.g., Bulmer2005; Fredericksen 1994, 2000; Golson 1972, 2001), the two types deﬁned byAraho et al. (2002) as ‘‘stemmed tools’’ comprise distinctive classes because theyusually have deep notches that delineate very well-deﬁned and pronounced tangs.Type 1 stemmed tools are made from prismatic blades and have large andclearly demarcated, oval-shaped tangs. In contrast, the Type 2 group is more vari-able. It is deﬁned primarily by the use of Kombewa ﬂakes (i.e., those removedfrom the bulbar face of a large ﬂake) for the blank form, as described in detail inRobin Torrence is Principal Research Scientist in Anthropology, Australian Museum, SydneyNSW, robin.torrence@austmus.gov.au; Pamela Swadling is a Visiting Research Fellow, Archaeol-ogy and Natural History, Research School of Paciﬁc Studies, Australian National University, Can-berra ACT, pamela.swadling@anu.edu.au; Nina Kononenko is an ARC post-doctoral fellow in theSchool of Philosophical and Historical Inquiry, University of Sydney, kononenko.nina@hotmail.com; Wallace Ambrose is a Visiting Research Fellow in Archaeology and Natural History, ResearchSchool of Paciﬁc Studies, Australian National University, wal.ambrose@anu.edu.au; Pip Rath is apost-graduate student in the School of Philosophical and Historical Inquiry, University of Sydney,Australia, prath@bigpond.net.au; Michael D.

(2002). Since Kombewa technology is extremely rare in stone toolassemblages from Melanesia, this trait alone easily separates Type 2 stemmed toolsfrom other retouched tools. The diagnostic characteristics of Type 1 and 2stemmed tools with lengths generally greater than 750 mm clearly distinguishthese tool types from other waisted or tanged chipped stone tools in this region.Examples of obsidian stemmed tools, mostly found in surface contexts, werereported decades ago (cf. Bulmer 2005; Golson 1972, 2001) but, lacking ﬁrmchronological context, their signiﬁcance was not appreciated until relatively largenumbers were recovered from stratiﬁed and well-dated deposits in recent excava-tions in New Britain, Papua New Guinea (e.g., Specht et al. 1988; Torrence et al.1990). Their chronological assignment to the early and middle Holocene is basedon their consistent recovery from radiocarbon-dated soils or from deposits withina well dated tephrastratigraphy and their absence in contexts dating to other peri-ods (Araho et al. 2002 : 62). In New Britain large stemmed tools are found in soilsburied underneath either the radiocarbon-dated W-K1 volcanic tephra (c. 6160–5740 b.p.) or the W-K2 tephra (3480–3160 b.p.) (Petrie and Torrence 2008). Incontrast, Lapita pottery is always stratiﬁed above and therefore younger than theW-K2 tephra.Araho et al. (2002), Torrence (2003, 2004a), and Specht (2005) suggested thatthese large stemmed tools functioned as ceremonial valuables ‘‘to create andmaintain social links between and within groups and to mark status di¤erences’’(Araho et al. 2002 : 77). This hypothesis is based on the use of manufacturingtechniques that require considerable e¤ort, skill, and care, and a raw material easilyassociated with speciﬁc, localized places, as well as the distinctive shapes, shini-ness, symmetry, and fragility of the tools. More recently, Specht (2005), Swadlingand Hide (2005 : 307), and Pavlides (pers. comm.) have reported additional exam-ples. Together with Golson (2005), all these scholars have also proposed that thedistributional data of obsidian stemmed tools, shell adzes, and mortars and pestlesprovide considerable tangible evidence for wide-scale social interaction duringthe mid-Holocene, long before the existence of Lapita pottery and colonizationinto Remote Oceania (cf. Torrence and Swadling 2008).Little is known about the social relationships that have been proposed as re-sponsible for the impressive spatial distribution of the stemmed tools. Did theseartifacts circulate within a system of ceremonial exchange on the Willaumez Pen-insula, where most examples have been recorded (Fig. 1)? Were the far-ﬂungcases merely rare leakages from that system or was the entire region where theyoccur linked through social interaction, and if so, in what ways? We address thesequestions through a series of analyses stimulated by a newly reported obsidianstemmed tool from Biak Island in West Papua (Friede 2005 : I, 41; II, 86) (Fig. 2).Research focused on three unusual characteristics of the Biak artifact has signiﬁ-cantly altered our understanding of stemmed tools. Firstly, geochemical sourcingtechniques identiﬁed the raw material as derived from obsidian outcrops in Manusrather than West New Britain where stemmed tools are common ﬁnds. Secondly,the highly unusual technique of hammer-dressing was used in its manufacture.Thirdly, the Biak provenience greatly extends the spatial distribution of stemmedtools. We consider the signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings for social interaction duringthe mid-Holocene period and for Paciﬁc prehistory in general.torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 121biak toolThe Biak tool clearly ﬁts the criteria for a Type 2 obsidian stemmed artifact be-cause it was made from a large Kombewa ﬂake and bears a prominent tang cre-ated by deep notches (Fig. 2). At 132 mm in length, it is within the range of thelarge Type 2 tools proposed as valuables (cf. Araho et al. 2002; Specht 2005 : 381;Torrence 2003, 2004b). Although the tool does not come from a secure archaeo-logical context, we believe that the distinctive similarity with the well-datedobsidian stemmed tools from New Britain is close enough to propose that theBiak tool belongs to the same typological group and therefore also dates to themid-Holocene.The stem on the tool was ﬁrst shaped by bifacial ﬂaking on what was probablythe proximal end of a large Kombewa ﬂake. Irregularities created by the ﬂakingwere then partially removed by hammer-dressing. The direct, hard hammer blowscreated a uniformly even, but rough-textured, surface with numerous, small im-pact points (Fig. 3). Hammer-dressing has obscured ﬂaking on the stem, exceptfor several ﬂat scars at the base. The hammer-dressing was also applied on bothsides of the tool to surfaces that were originally smooth and shiny. On one ﬂakesurface the hammer-dressing is continuous with that on the stem (Fig. 2, right),Fig. 2. Obsidian stemmed tool found on Biak: (left) hammer-dressing is visible both on the stemand on the middle of the blade; (right) hammer-dressing has obscured most of the original surfaceof the ﬂake, but a portion is visible on the top left. Scale bar is 3 cm. (Photo by R. Torrence)asian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 2009122whereas on the other there is an isolated, circular patch of hammering on theblade of the tool (Fig. 2, left). As indicated by ﬂake scars with di¤erent degrees ofweathering, the tool has been extensively reworked. Areas of retouch around theentire working edge include two large, invasive, fresh scars struck from opposingsides, which stretch across much of the surface of one face (Fig. 2; right; cf.Specht 2005: Figs. 28.4, 28.5).John Friede (2005: II, 86), a private collector who kindly loaned the artifact toSwadling for analysis, reports that the new stemmed tool was ‘‘found in a cave onBiak Island with Japanese war relics.’’ We have no information about whether thetool was excavated or was found on the surface. It seems highly unlikely that thetool had been transported to the island by a Japanese soldier. Biak had been ofFig. 3. Close-up of hammer-dressing on the stem of the Biak tool. Scale bar is 2 cm. (Photo byR. Torrence)torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 123little strategic importance to the Japanese until faced with the westward advanceof the Allied forces along the coast of New Guinea. The island has no naturalharbors and fresh water is not readily available. In an e¤ort to stop the advancingAllied forces, the Japanese decided to make Biak a key air base, as it was withinﬁghter range of many existing air bases in Dutch New Guinea. Late in 1943,they began constructing airstrips in the southeastern part of the island on thecoastal plain. The troops sent to protect and hold Biak did not come from thePaciﬁc, but were sent from China (Smith 1953 : 280, 281, 299). Sketches by anAmerican soldier show a range of defensive walls constructed in the Biak caves(Riegelman 1955). It seems likely that in building these, any archaeologicaldeposits would have been highly disturbed. Given the historical data to hand, themost parsimonious assumption is that the Biak stemmed tool was deposited in thecave during prehistory and was uncovered during the construction of defenses bythe Japanese or, perhaps, through more recent activity. Regardless of the lack ofstratigraphic integrity for the Biak tool, its strong resemblance to Type 2 stemmedtools made on Kombewa ﬂakes provides strong support for accepting a mid-Holocene date for its manufacture.characterization studiesPIXE-PIGME analyses have demonstrated that obsidian from all the major obsid-ian sources in New Britain (Gulu, Kutau-Bao, Baki, Mopir) was used in the pro-duction of stemmed tools (Araho et al. 2002; Rath and Torrence 2003) and thatthree stemmed tools in the Sepik-Ramu region of the New Guinea mainlandwere also made from New Britain obsidian (Specht 2005 : 384; Swadling andHide 2005 : 307; Figs. 1, 4). Since the Biak stemmed tool is very similar in formFig. 4. Location of NewBritain, Lou Island, and PamIsland obsidian sources.asian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 2009124and manufacturing technique to these artifacts, one could reasonably infer that itwas also derived from New Britain. To test this assumption, we employed a com-bination of PIXE-PIGME, LA/ICPMS, and INAA techniques to characterize theBiak tool and samples from six stemmed tools and two ﬂakes from Garua Islandthat also have traces of hammer-dressing (Tables 1 and 2; Figs. 5–7). Ambrose ob-tained su‰cient material for the geochemical study and then conserved the Biakartifact so the sampling region was invisible.The ﬁrst analysis used LA/ICPMS at the Australian National University tocharacterize the Biak artifact and two stemmed tools from site FAP on GaruaIsland. The results are presented in Tables 3 and 4 where they are compared tosource samples. A correspondence analysis of the Papua New Guinea obsidiansources shows that the Biak tool clusters with source material from Lou and PamIslands in Manus province (Fig. 8). In contrast, the stemmed tools from site FAPon Garua Island match the composition of sources from the Baki source, also onGarua Island. The East Fergusson cluster comprises samples from Dobu Island,Table 2.

Based onextensive studies of obsidian sources (Bird 1996; Bird et al. 1997), the Biak toolcan be assigned to the Umleang/Umrei source on Lou Island, whereas all of thehammer-dressed stemmed tools from Garua Island are associated with the Bakichemical group, some of which outcrops in the same streambed where the toolswere found. FAP M200 was assigned to the GaralaC subgroup of the Baki chem-ical group, which outcrops both on Garua Island near the site of FAP and onnearby Garala Island.

(1998), found that a further cortical ﬂake with hammer-dressingmatched the composition of the Baki source (Tables 3, 7).The characterization studies provide the ﬁrst evidence that stemmed tools weremanufactured using obsidian from Manus as well as from New Britain. Beforeconsidering the profound social implications of Manus as a second source forstemmed tools (cf. Specht 2005 : 385), we turn to the second unique attribute ofthe Biak tool.an unusual techniqueThe use of hammer-dressing on the stem and blade of the Biak tool is notrecorded for ﬂaked obsidian artifacts in any other areas of the world. Grinding,another technique that does not involve ﬂaking, is found on the platforms of ob-sidian blade cores from Mesoameria (e.g., Sheets 1978), but hammer-dressing hasnot been reported previously on ﬂaked obsidian tools, although it is common onartifacts made from less isotropic stone. In contrast, this highly unusual techniquefor ﬂaked artifacts is found on rare stemmed tools from Garua Island (Fig. 1), butis absent on the neighboring New Britain mainland, even from large assemblagesat sites FRL and FCH (Araho 1996; Araho et al. 2002; Fullagar 1992; Specht1973, 1974; Specht et al. 1988), or at the Mopir obsidian outcrops (Fullagar et al.1991). Outside New Britain, hammer-dressing occurs on a broken retouchedﬂake from Lihir, New Ireland (Casey 1939 : 149–150, ﬁg 7b; Specht 2005 : 384),which may part of a Type 2 stemmed tool made on a ‘secondary series’ Kombewaﬂake, as deﬁned by Araho et al. (2002 : 66, ﬁgs. 7, 12; Fig. 1).Among the tens of thousands of artifacts examined from Garua Island, onlyeight bear hammer-dressing (Tables 1 and 2): four complete and one brokenType 2 stemmed tools; one bifacially retouched stem that might derive from abroken Type 2 form; and two ﬂakes (Figs. 5–7). All the artifacts are derived fromthe FAP obsidian quarry and workshop site, which is located adjacent to the Bakiobsidian source (e.g., Torrence et al. 1990 : 461) or were excavated from site FAOsituated on a hilltop directly above the obsidian outcrops. Since the Garuahammer-dressed tools are in association with debris from tool manufacture, theymay be rejects rather than ﬁnished examples. This might explain why the Garuaartifacts are smaller than the Biak tool, although the proportions of the stem andblade are similar (Table 1). On the other hand, the Garua examples could be toolsthat had been used, but were thrown away once replacements had been made atthe quarry, or tools used in activities within this general location.Table 7. INAA analysis of nine source samples and one cortical flake withhammer-dressing from the FAO site (NAA 14)sample Dy (ppm) Mn (ppm)NAA 14 4.39 475Baki source mean 4.59 482Baki source s.d. 0.34 5.77torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 131The two waste ﬂakes demonstrate that hammer-dressed tools were manufac-tured on Garua Island (Table 3). Given the type of force applied during hammer-dressing, breakages obviously occurred during manufacture. For example, only asmall pecked area is present on the FAP M224 broken stem, which implies thatduring manufacture the tool snapped cleanly at the weakest point: the junctionof the stem and the rest of the ﬂake.Like the Biak tool, the Garua hammer-dressed stemmed tools have a robust,sturdy feel to them. Firstly, the stems are quite thick compared to others reported(Table 1; Torrence 2004a : 167). Secondly, the notches forming the stem are rela-tively shallow and any corners created by them are quite thick. Thirdly, althoughseveral have a slightly convex working edge viewed in plan, in most cases theedges are relatively straight and di¤er from the highly rounded, crescent shape ofother more elaborate types (Araho et al. 2002; Torrence 2003). FAP M267 (Fig.7) varies from the others because of the presence of retouch along one edge. Thiswas applied to the core before the Kombewa ﬂake that forms FAP M267 wasstruck (cf. Araho et al. 2002: ﬁg. 8).The Garua hammer-dressed tools are dated by a combination of tephrastrati-graphy and AMS dating. FAP M267 (Fig. 7) was found in a stream section imme-diately under a layer of redeposited W-K1 tephra. The unit is dated by an AMSdetermination of 5204e 85 (NZA 1570; 5740–6210 b.p.) on charcoal from thesame stratigraphic level in a test pit c. 100 m upstream (Torrence et al. 1990 : 461).Secondly, a cortical ﬂake with hammer-dressing was recovered from a level datedby AMS to 3532e 66 (NZA 2901; 3640–3990 b.p.) at site FAO. These datesplace hammer-dressed stemmed tools on Garua Island ﬁrmly within the mid-Holocene and prior to the local appearance of Lapita pottery (Torrence andStevenson 2000).The presence of hammer-dressing on the Biak and Garua artifacts is intriguing.Obsidian is notable for its shininess, a characteristic often associated with aestheticand symbolic meanings typical of valuables (cf. Torrence 2005). It therefore seemsstrange that the tool’s reﬂective surface was deliberately destroyed. To understandwhy hammer-dressing was applied, we consider its potential role for tool-use andthe wider social implications of this unusual technique.tool-useSince they are so rare, one might predict that the hammer-dressed tools were spe-cial in some way. The plans of stemmed tools with hammer-dressing can begrouped into two broad shapes. Only one tool from Garua (FAP M267) has thesame rectangular-shaped blade as the Biak tool (in its current reworked form),whereas the majority has a trapezoidal shape with expanding sides that maximizethe length of the working edge. The Lihir tool may represent a third oval, bladeshape. The rectangular blades have deeper notches than the expanding bladegroup. The longitudinal sections of the two groups also di¤er. The Biak and FAPM267 tools have a relatively straight, ﬂat longitudinal proﬁle with a relativelyconsistent thickness along the whole length of the tool (Figs. 2, 7). Those in thesecond group have a very thick stem in comparison to the working edge so theproﬁle either tapers smoothly toward the edge (e.g., FAP M702, Fig. 6) or thereis a prominent angle along one of the faces (e.g., FAP M200, Fig. 6). In both casesasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 2009132the result is a relatively thick and long working edge that is controlled from amuch narrower stem that could ﬁt nicely within a handle or straight into thehand.The hammer-dressed tools were designed on di¤erent principles than the moreelaborate and fragile Type 2 stemmed tools previously proposed as valuables (e.g.,Araho et al. 2002; Torrence 2004a). Firstly, the latter usually have a crescent-shaped blade with the rounded edge proﬁle forming an arc. Secondly, there aredeep notches leading to fragile protrusions or tips (Araho et al. 2002: ﬁgs. 2, 3,12; Torrence 2003: ﬁg. 18.3, 2004a: ﬁgs. 3, 4). Thirdly, the stem of the elaboratetype is not located at the proximal end of the Kombewa ﬂake. Instead, the bulbof percussion has been removed by the notch which forms the stem. This meansthat the distal end of the stem is the original sharp, thin edge of the ﬂake (Tor-rence 2004a: Figs. 5, 6). Such thin, fragile stemmed tools would have broken un-der minimal stress. In comparison, stemmed tools proposed by Torrence (2003,2004a) to have had utilitarian or mixed uses were made with the thick, bulbarpart of the ﬂake forming the distal end of the stem as in the case of the hammer-dressed tools.Use-Wear AnalysisAlthough the hammer-dressed tools appear to be quite robust and functional, it isstill possible that they were used in activities that had special signiﬁcance. Unfor-tunately, the original edges of almost all have been removed, as in the case of theBiak tool, or extensively damaged by movement within the streambed wherethey were found. Kononenko found that only FAP M267, which was found insitu under a thick layer of redeposited W-K1 tephra within a steep bank ofMalaiol Stream (Torrence et al. 1990 : 461), was well enough preserved for use-wear analysis. Fortunately, of all the hammer-dressed tools from Garua, FAPM267 most closely resembles the Biak tool in terms of the shape of the blade andthe distribution of hammer-dressing. After cleaning, Kononenko examined theartifact under both low- and high-power magniﬁcation following the basic meth-odology outlined by Fullagar (2005). A combination of edge morphology, stria-tions, polish, and residues was used to interpret past tool use.The working edge of FAP M267 is slightly rounded in plan view and is stillrelatively sharp. Under low-power magniﬁcation feathered and isolated micro-scars were observed on both faces along the distal edge (i.e., opposite the stem).More intensive damage, in the form of continuous feathered microscars, is locatedon the right-hand side of the face in Figure 7B. Comparison of the use-wearmicroscars with fresh scarring and unused surfaces together with the presence ofstriations within the microscars indicate that they were formed as a result of tooluse.Two forms of striations, (1) narrow and (2) deep and intermittent (Hurcombe1992 : 37), were observed mainly on the right-hand side of the face shown in Fig-ure 7B. They run parallel or in a slightly diagonal direction to the edge and some-times cross each other. The striations called ‘‘sleeks’’ located along the edge areprimarily observed in association with isolated microscars (Fig. 7, points 1, 2, 3,5; Fig. 10 A, B, D, F). This pattern of striations was also observed on experimen-tal tools used for processing soft, elastic materials such as skin, meat or ﬁsh (Fig.torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 133Fig. 10. Use-wear on hammer-dressed stemmed tool FAP M267. For location of points see Figure7. A, point 1: slightly rounded edge; light polish; discontinuous bending and feather scars; diagonal,deep, isolated striations of sleek and rarely intermittent types (100). B, point 2: feather and bend-ing scars; parallel, isolated, long, and deep striations with a few diagonal striations (100). C, point2: intensive edge rounding and developed polish with some diagonal, isolated striations (500). D,point 3: feather and bending scars; isolated, deep, parallel, and diagonal striations of intermittent andsleek types. Note that striations spread into scars (100). E, point 4: intensive edge rounding;patches of dense, deep, isolated sleek and intermittent striations and a few ﬂaked striations on theedge; developed polish (100). F, point 5: intensive edge rounding; discontinuous feather scars;light to developed polish; isolated shallow and deep, parallel striations (100). (Photos by N. Kono-nenko)11E, F). In addition, numerous and more obvious intermittent striations are asso-ciated with an area of intensive scarring at point 4 in Figure 7. These wear formssuggest that this part of the edge had more intensive contact with a harder mate-rial such as bone.In terms of polishes, there are a few spots with thin lines or patches that havesmoothed bright polish that extends from the higher peaks into low areas of theobsidian surface (Fig. 10C). The distribution of the polish, its association withedge rounding, and the pattern of the striations provide additional support forthe hypothesis that the tool was used for cutting a soft, elastic material, but alsooccasionally made contact with a harder substance.It is important to note that the degree of use-wear on FAP M267 is relativelyintensive. Based on experiments, it was used in excess of 30 minutes. The size andshape of the working edge of FAP M267 indicate its appropriateness for use onlarge-size animals. The use-wear traces are entirely consistent with cutting thecarcass or working the ﬂesh and bones of large-bodied animals such as crocodiles,turtles, tuna, dolphins, or even humans. At this stage the use-wear analysis neithersupports nor challenges the possible ceremonial or ritual use of FAP M267.HaftingThe use-wear results suggest that the extra care and attention directed to thehandle in the form of hammer-dressing may have been necessary for tool func-tion, because a precision grip may have been required to e¤ectively complete thetask. Certainly, if much force was applied, e.g., in butchery or warfare, a securehold would have been highly beneﬁcial. Araho et al. (2002 : 70–71) noted thathammer-dressing converted smooth obsidian into a rough and irregular surfacethat would better support a strong grip when held directly in the hand or aid inthe attachment of a wrapped or wooden handle.The use-wear study found microscopic evidence for hafting on the stem ofFAP M267. Along the left edge of the stem in Figure 7B, there are a few areaswith scars that are associated with a net of intermittent and sleek striations (Fig.10A). These are further accompanied by light polish and some plant tissue (Fig.7, point 20). A similar constellation of abrasion, polish, striations and plant tissuewas observed at some elevated areas of the stem (e.g., Fig. 7, point 7; Fig. 11B).These use-wear traces indicate that the haft had come in contact with wood orperhaps from string made from a woody plant, such as rattan. A similar wearpattern was observed on an experimental tool that was placed inside a woodenhandle (Fig. 11C, D).The role of hammer-dressing in improving the grip seems particularly apt fortools FAP M267, FAP M200, and FAP M408 since much of the percussion dam-age occurs on ﬂat, unﬂaked surfaces (Figs. 5–7). FAP M702 is hammer-dressed onboth the ﬂaked surface that forms the notches and on the smooth surface of theﬂake between them (Fig. 6). It is plausible that the e¤ective application of forceon the long working edge on these tools demanded a sturdy handle and this wasassisted by the simultaneous smoothing of the bifacially ﬂaked stem and theroughening of the glassy ﬂake surface.The Biak tool may incorporate elements of both these functions because thebifacially ﬂaked stem is extensively covered with hammer-dressing and where thistorrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 135Fig. 11.

Kononenko)is absent, the ﬂake scars are very ﬂat. The impact cones from percussion, however,also extend quite far onto the smooth, shiny, ﬂat ﬂake surface above the notchingon both faces of the tool (Fig. 2), suggesting that the roughening of the smoothsurfaces may have been applied to secure wrapping or a haft for a handle. The hy-pothetical use of wrapping is very similar to the way long obsidian blades wererecently attached to spears in Manus (Moseley 1877: pl. xx; Torrence 1993 : 472),although there is no evidence of hammer-dressing on these tools.The isolated patch of hammer-dressing on the blade may have had an entirelydi¤erent function and history (Fig. 2, left). One possible explanation is that thetool was used as an anvil, perhaps for bipolar working of stone tools, as has beenhypothesized for similar patterns on ground edge axes in Australia (McCarthyet al. 1946 : 44, Figs. 257, 279), although the Australian examples often havea deﬁnite pitted area which is not present on the Biak tool.non-utilitarian rolesAlthough preparing the obsidian surface so that it can be comfortably and safelyheld or securely hafted makes good functional sense, hammer-dressing is so rarein Melanesian obsidian assemblages, even among stemmed tools, that we questionwhether its application on the mid-Holocene obsidian tools described here waspurely or even primarily utilitarian. An alternative hypothesis is that the rough-ened surface was aesthetic or had ideological signiﬁcance. Since obsidian is natu-rally shiny, a dull surface could have carried symbolic meaning. Another possibil-ity is that creating a rough exterior made it resemble some other type of stonenot found locally and perhaps therefore signiﬁcant. Along these lines, the pres-ence of artifacts in the New Guinea Highlands that resemble stemmed tools, butmade from di¤erent raw materials (e.g., Bulmer 2005 : 432 type 3c), is provoca-tive, although in the absence of good chronology for the New Guinea examples,one might well ask who was imitating whom.Rath and Torrence (2003) have suggested that the numerous stages of produc-tion necessary for the manufacture of stemmed tools might have contributed totheir social signiﬁcance in several ways. Firstly, the additional care and e¤ortinvested in their manufacture may have added to their ‘‘value.’’ Secondly, their pro-duction may have required special skills that were not widely shared in the popu-lation, therefore requiring the creation of social relationships with one or moreknowledgeable knappers. Thirdly, the staged reduction sequence provided oppor-tunities for moving the tool between several producers or craft specialists locatedin di¤erent places. Possession of the ﬁnal tool would therefore provide concreteproof that a series of social relations had been successfully negotiated. Hammer-dressing might then represent an extra step in production that required additionalskills or persons and therefore further enhanced the value of these objects.A ﬁnal suggestion is that this stage of stemmed tool production o¤ered oppor-tunities for ‘‘craft-as-performance’’ as described by Carter (2007 : 94). The makingof a tool could have been a ritualized act, especially since hammering a fragile ob-sidian tool without breaking it was a very risky business. One could imagine thatthe rhythm of the hammering and the associated sounds were conducive to apublic performance of skills incorporated into a ceremony.torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 137Replication ExperimentTo evaluate the Rath and Torrence hypotheses, Nina Kononenko conducted areplication experiment aimed at assessing the time and skill requirements andfunctional advantages of hammer-dressing. In the ﬁrst stage of manufacture, aroughly circular, thick ﬂake with a large bulb of percussion was struck from a coreof New Britain obsidian using direct percussion. Although not strictly a Kom-bewa ﬂake, the blank resembled many stemmed tools in terms of its bilateral sym-metry and longitudinal cross section. The ventral and dorsal surfaces of the ﬂakeintersected to form a relatively thick and sturdy distal edge. Next, a combinationof invasive and steep bifacial percussion was applied to the bulbar end of the ﬂaketo create the two notches that delineate the stem and create its roughly triangularcross section. Four heavy river cobbles of relatively soft material were used ashammerstones to make the stemmed tool.The presence of a prominent ridge creating the thick, triangular cross sectionof the stem and the sharp, fresh ﬂake scars made the stem di‰cult to grasp. Addi-tionally, any movement of the tool within a haft would have torn it and eventu-ally destroyed a wooden collar or wrapping. One way to avoid this problemwould be to smooth the surface of the stem and at the same time convert thecross section into a round or oval shape more easily hafted. To achieve thesegoals, hard hammer blows were applied directly to the surface of the stem andthe notches.During the hammer-dressing, as much as possible of the tool rested on a softwood anvil to prevent unequal stress that could cause breakage at the junction ofthe stem and the body of the ﬂake. During much of the experiment the sharp dis-tal edge of the ﬂake was covered by a soft animal skin to protect the hand holdingthe tool. Of eight hammerstones tested, two were preferable. Both of these rivercobbles had a narrow edge and one had a relatively pointed shape. It was foundthat limiting the amount of surface that came in contact with the obsidian surfaceincreased the accuracy of the hammering.Hammer-dressing was restricted to the area of the stem with deep ﬂake scars.The blows were positioned carefully and not applied too forcefully so as to avoidbreakage. During this process, the sharp edges of the stem were replaced by smallround impact cones created by the hammering (Fig. 12). Although on the smallscale these create an irregular surface, it is relatively level and smooth to thetouch. During this process microﬂakes were also removed, although these werenot intended. Despite care taken to anchor the tool, a section of the weakest partof the edge, representing the corner just above the notch on one side, su¤eredvibrations and broke o¤ due to end shock (Fig. 12).After 40 minutes, the cross section of the stem had been rounded and the sharpedges removed. At this stage the stem could be held comfortably in the hand. Theconical impact fractures created on the experimental tool and the hammer-dressedsurfaces of the archaeological artifacts are roughly similar, although those createdon the experimental surface are less distinct and more highly fractured andcrushed, possibly due to the use of softer hammerstones with a more rounded sur-face and/or the application of a higher density of blows (Fig. 13).The experiment demonstrated that hammer-dressing is an e¤ective wayto smooth contours and reshape a ﬂaked stem, but also that the procedure isasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 2009138relatively time-consuming and demands appropriate equipment (hammerstones,anvil, hand protection) that must be used with relative precision. An experiencedperson using a better hammerstone might complete the task more quickly, butpecking still takes more time than ﬂaking. It is also clear from the replication ex-periment that care is needed to create the desired surface without damaging thetool. The likelihood of breakage explains why all the hammer-dressed stemmedtools are robust. Hammering is a very risky strategy when there are protrudingedges or tips and favors stems formed from the thickest (bulbar) end of the ﬂakeblank.In summary, the replication experiment provides support for hypotheses thatconsider the role of the handle, energy and skill inputs, and multiple stages ofproduction, since all are required. Freshly ﬂaked obsidian is sharp, so dulling a po-tential handle reduces risks of injury and damage to a haft or handle. The proce-dure also requires extra time, care, skill, and perhaps practice. Although discrimi-nation among the potential reasons for the use of hammer-dressing on stemmedtools will require further research and more data about how the tools were usedand exchanged in the past, the use-wear analysis and replication experiment arehelpful in suggesting future directions.Fig. 12.

(Photo by N.Kononenko)torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 139innovation, imitation, and interactionAlthough it is possible that the combination of the two unusual and highly de-manding techniques, hammer-dressing and Kombewa ﬂakes, was invented inde-pendently at the two widely separated obsidian source areas on Garua and LouIslands (in New Britain and Manus, respectively; Figs. 1, 4), in our view such acoincidence is highly unlikely. The more plausible scenario is that the similar-ities are the result of signiﬁcant contact between people living on two distantislands. Perhaps the precise form of the artifact was copied by knappers from onearea after viewing it, either at the other production center or at any of the widelydistributed places where stemmed tools may have been exchanged, as representedby the current ﬁnd spots (Fig. 1). The Kombewa technique is so complex and dif-ﬁcult that we feel imitation is also highly unlikely. It is most plausible thatthe replication of identical technologies in two di¤erent places was the outcomeof prolonged interaction. We suggest that the use of similar methods to make ob-sidian stemmed tools was either because (1) people shared ideologies about therole and meaning of the tools, or that (2) competing groups on Garua and Louused the same forms to gain access to exchange with third parties.Fig. 13. Close-up views of impact fractures on hammer-dressed obsidian stemmed tools. Clockwisefrom top left: FAP M200; FAP M702; FAP M408; experimental tool. Scale bar is 1 cm. (Photos byR. Torrence)asian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 2009140Although limited, there is some archaeological evidence that obsidian stemmedtools may have been made on Lou Island. Two Type 2 stemmed tools and acurved stem from an unknown type have been reported from the nearby main-land of Manus (cf. Araho et al. 2002: Table 1; Bu¨hler 1935 : 21, 1946–1949 : 230;Casey 1939 : 147, Fig. 6; Nevermann 1934 : 341, Fig. 193; Ohnemus 1996 : 363,Fig. 433.10), but none has been found near the obsidian sources on Lou Island.Another problem is that Lou Island obsidian is rare in the mid-Holocene archae-ological record (e.g., White 1996) and none has been previously found outsideManus province. In addition, only four artifacts from mid-Holocene levels at thePamwak site on Manus have been characterized to Lou Island sources and one ofthese is not from the Umleang source (Fredericksen 1997 : 72).Since artifacts with stems or tangs (but not made on Kombewa ﬂakes) weremade on Lou Island beginning in the late Holocene and continuing up to the re-cent period (Friedericksen 1994, 2000), Type 2 stemmed tools might representtheir mid-Holocene precursors. Furthermore, the current lack of evidence forstemmed tools on Lou Island during the mid-Holocene could be explained bythe paucity of contemporary contexts (Kennedy 2002). For example, excavationsat the site of Umleang, where obsidian outcrops match the chemical compositionof the obsidian used in the Biak tool, have not reached the mid-Holocene land-scape, which is buried by deep layers of recent volcanic ash that overlie most ofthe island (e.g., Ambrose 1988, 1998; Ambrose et al. 1981; Fredericksen 2000).Although perhaps unlikely because of the large distances involved, it is not im-possible that people from Lou Island took obsidian to Garua Island where onlycertain people had the skills, knowledge, and right to make hammer-dressedtools. We already know that Kutau-Bao obsidian from mainland New Britainwas transported to Garua Island and converted into Type 1 stemmed tools(Rath and Torrence 2003), and a ﬂake (FAP M228) found on Garua and sourcedto Kutau-Bao has been hammer-dressed (Table 3). In addition, since hammer-dressing is absent from the relatively large collections of stemmed tools frommainland New Britain sites at FRL and FCH (e.g., Araho 1996), it is possiblethat the technique was restricted to Garua Island. In this regard, Nevermann’s(1934) report that in historic times access to the recent obsidian quarries atUmleang and knowledge of blade production was tightly controlled is relevant.The geographical location of the highly skilled knappers in historic Manus, how-ever, was not restricted to the obsidian sources themselves, so this provides a pre-cedent for raw material moving to producers located elsewhere (Fullagar andTorrence 1991 : 116).Alternately, craft specialists from Garua may have been brought to Lou Islandto make stemmed tools by sponsors seeking to enhance their prestige, possibly aspart of the performance within a ceremony (cf. Carter 2004, 2007). If so, thenthese tools may have had a very special value either in social or utilitarian terms.The use-wear results indicate that at least one hammer-dressed tool was used forcutting a large animal, which could include its use in warfare. Perhaps this tooltype had special ideological signiﬁcance within a ceremonial or warfare context.In addition, control over knowledge and skills suggests intense social interactionand possible competition for status, since individuals must have successfully nego-tiated and manipulated social relationships to obtain raw materials and ﬁnishedgoods (Rath and Torrence 2003).torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 141Further archaeological research, particularly on Lou Island, is necessary to de-termine the precise social relationships implied by the Biak and Garua hammer-dressed obsidian artifacts. At this stage, however, we conclude that independentinnovation in two di¤erent places or direct copying are unlikely. Instead, thealternatives—employing craft specialists, or replication following training in thisrelatively sophisticated technology—all demand signiﬁcant interaction betweenindividuals from Garua and Lou Islands.interaction spheresHaving considered the unusual geological source and technique of hammer-dressing, we now turn to the third important attribute of the Biak artifact: its geo-graphical location. Given the information at hand, the most parsimonious conclu-sion is that the Biak tool was derived from archaeological deposits on Biak thatwere disturbed by Japanese building activities during the war. Another possibilityis that the tool was taken to Biak from Manus by a Japanese soldier as a souvenir,but this scenario is quite unlikely given the history of Japanese troop movementsduring World War II. On February 29, 1943, the Allies attacked Japanese posi-tions on Manus. Heavy ﬁghting ensued and by May 18, 1943, the ﬁghting wasover and 3,317 of the original 4,600 Japanese stationed there had been buried(Dexter 1961 : 795–797). It is doubtful that any survivors played a further part inthe war and therefore unlikely that a Japanese soldier ﬁghting on Manus trans-ported the stemmed tool to Biak.If the hammer-dressed stemmed tool was indeed deposited in the Biak caveduring prehistory, it had traveled c. 1200 km from the obsidian source on LouIsland. This new ﬁnd could therefore markedly increase the geographic scale ofsocial relations represented by obsidian stemmed tools to a region extending fromWest Papua to southern Bougainville, a distance of c. 2200 km (Fig. 1). The loca-tion of the Biak tool also means that we should seriously reconsider the possibilityof social relations between Melanesia and regions to the west during the mid-Holocene.Swadling (1996 : 15, 51–53) proposed wide-scale interaction beginning in theearly Holocene between New Guinea and islands to the west, but until recentlythere has been very little concrete evidence to support her hypothesis. Drawingon previous work (Araho et al. 2002; Golson 2001, 2005; Swadling and Hide2005; Torrence 2003, 2004b), Specht (2005 : 387) proposed that obsidianstemmed tools are ‘‘a highly visible archaeological indicator’’ ‘‘of long-standingsocial connections’’ during the mid-Holocene. The distance over which the toolstraveled from the obsidian sources in New Britain and Manus is so considerablethat it is di‰cult to imagine that everyone who possessed one was actively en-gaged within the same ceremonial system of exchange and status, although givenour discussion of interaction between the obsidian sources of Garua and Lou, thissuggestion requires serious research.More important than the overall distribution of extant stemmed tools, thesharing of the Kombewa technology and hammer-dressing required contact be-tween the people who made the Biak and Garua Island obsidian stemmed toolsand these networks must have stretched over areas larger than those recorded byethnography for recent Melanesian trading systems. The overall spatial pattern ofasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 2009142stemmed tools, however, may not necessarily have resulted from direct commu-nication among all the areas where this tool type has been found. The artifactsmay have circulated through a di¤use network of links rather than through a sin-gle, organized exchange system. For example, White (1996) has shown that thearchaeological distribution of obsidian in the recent period is not restricted to thearea encompassed by exchange systems described by ethnographers. Instead, re-cent obsidian artifacts are spread over a much larger region than self-deﬁned ex-change systems because social relationships rarely have tight boundaries, exchangesystems often overlap, and objects frequently leak out into a wider social sphere(cf. Specht 2005 : 385–386). In this regard, the extensive amount of reworkingaround the blade of the Biak tools is relevant and may signify a long and complexhistory of use and meanings as it was exchanged and moved through space andtime.Stone mortars and pestles and shell artifacts dating to the mid-Holocene havealso been used as evidence for wide-scale social interaction within mainland NewGuinea and between the islands and the mainland (Golson 2005 : 484; Swadling2005; Swadling and Hide 2005; Swadling et al. 2008). The translocation of vari-ous animals to Manus and New Britain is another indication of links betweenthese islands and the New Guinea mainland (White 2004). Perhaps it was on themainland that people from Manus and New Britain came into contact and thenexchanged or borrowed knowledge and skills relevant to stemmed tools or com-peted for status. Whatever scenario is established by future research, it is clear thatthe mid-Holocene was a period in which ideas and possibly people were regularlymoving over long distances.implications for pacific prehistoryIn contrast to recent obsidian exchange systems through which unmodiﬁed blocksor small pieces of obsidian were distributed (e.g., Specht 1981), the mid-Holocenestemmed tools are a ﬁnely worked product with recognizable shapes. As theypassed between hands across social and language boundaries, these distinctive arti-facts had the potential to carry various meanings and information with them. Theexchange of these tools therefore must have established routes along which a rangeof ideas, ceremonies, dances, etc., as well as concrete objects could have ﬂowed,possibly as far as from Biak to Bougainville.If people from Manus and New Britain were in regular communication, asimplied by our analyses of the hammer-dressed tools, then the spread of goodsand ideas might have been relatively rapid. Given the location of Biak, on theedge of Southeast Asia, it is also possible that Melanesia had extensive contacts tothe west from at least the mid-Holocene. The existence of a large-scale mid-Holocene interaction sphere or even a loose network of social relations throughwhich goods like stemmed tools, social practices, and ceremonies involved withthe stone mortars and pestles were already circulating, created a mechanism forthe borrowing and circulation of ideas from the west. If so, then the subsequentadoption and spread of Austronesian languages, Lapita style pottery, pigs, etc., didnot necessarily require human migrations. As we have shown, by at least the mid-Holocene period, interaction networks distributing elaborate items of materialculture had already set the stage for changes later signaled by Lapita style pottery.torrence et al. . mid-holocene social interaction in melanesia 143Given the limited amount of archaeological research on the mid-Holocene,the small number of stemmed tools probably represents the tip of the iceberg. Asyet the exact timing and motivation for the long-distance interaction representedby the spatial distribution of hammer-dressed obsidian stemmed tools is unknownand requires sustained research. Possibly rising sea levels destroyed homelandsas well as created new opportunities that might have spurred on movements ofpeople through and within the broader Southeast Asian/Melanesian region (e.g.,Oppenheimer 1998; Terrell 2004 : 605–606). What is clear, however, is that fur-ther research on social interaction during the mid-Holocene period is likely toyield provocative alternative scenarios for Melanesian prehistory.acknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to John Friede for encouraging the research, lending thestemmed tool for study and permitting the characterization analyses.

West-port, Conn.: Praeger.abstractThe widespread distribution in Papua New Guinea of obsidian stemmed tools datedto the mid-Holocene has led scholars to postulate the existence of large interactionspheres. A newly reported artifact from Biak Island, West Papua provides the stimu-lus for reconsidering the role of this tool type in regional social interaction. The toolwas hammer-dressed, a technique unknown for obsidian ﬂaked tools elsewhere inthe world and only rarely applied to obsidian artifacts in Melanesia. This new ﬁndclosely resembles hammer-dressed obsidian stemmed tools from Garua Island, PapuaNew Guinea, but these are characterized by LA/ICPMS, PIXE-PGME, and INAAto the local Baki and Kutau-Bao obsidian sources in New Britain, Papua NewGuinea, whereas the Biak tool is sourced to outcrops on Lou Island in Manus Prov-ince, Papua New Guinea. Hypotheses for functional, symbolic, and social roles ofhammer-dressing are explored and evaluated on the basis of replication experimentsand use-wear analyses. We argue that the complex and exceptionally rare technolo-gies used for manufacturing hammer-dressed stemmed tools and applied to obsidianacquired from two widely separated obsidian sources substantially add to previousevidence for wide-scale social interaction during the mid-Holocene. The existenceof these social networks might also have provided a mechanism for the rapid, exten-sive spread of innovations like Austronesian languages or Lapita pottery.
