ABSTRACT: 
This paper assesses the feasibility of determining key household characteristics based on temporal load profiles of household electricity demand. It is known that household characteristics, behaviours and routines drive a number of features of household electricity loads in ways which are currently not fully understood. The roll out of domestic smart meters in the UK and elsewhere could enable better understanding through the collection of high temporal resolution electricity monitoring data at the household level. Such data affords tremendous potential to invert the established relationship between household characteristics and temporal load profiles. Rather than use household characteristics as a predictor of loads, observed electricity load profiles, or indicators based on them, could instead be used to impute household characteristics. These micro level imputed characteristics could then be aggregated at the small area level to produce ‘census-like’ small area indicators. This work briefly reviews the nature of current and future census taking in the UK before outlining the household characteristics that are to be found in the UK census and which are also known to influence electricity load profiles. It then presents descriptive analysis of two smart meter-like datasets of half-hourly domestic electricity consumption before reporting on the results from a multilevel modelling-based analysis of the same data. The work concludes that a number of household characteristics of the kind to be found in UK census-derived small area statistics may be predicted from particular load profile indicators. A discussion of the steps required to test and validate this approach and the wider implications for census taking is also provided.

Energy monitoring for a ‘Smart Census’Area based population statistics in the United Kingdom (UK) havehistorically been derived from the decadal census of housing and popu-lation. In addition to basic demographic statistics, the socio-economicinformation collected is used to produce robust small area estimatesof a range of characteristics for every neighbourhood. Representing ‘adefinitive snapshot of the nation’ (Calder & Teague, 2013) this data pro-vides a backbone for commercial, academic and social research as wellas policy analysis, a decadal ‘re-grouping’ and ‘re-basing’ of all smallarea population projections statistics (Norman, 2013) and, crucially, na-tional and local resource allocation (Eurostat, 2011; Norman, 2013).Nonetheless, the UK census has also faced criticism as a costly and fre-quently outdated source of population statistics, with a time lag of atn), X.Lin@soton.ac.uk (S. Lin),(A. Bahaj),. This is an open access article underleast two years between data collection and reporting (Dugmore,Furness, Leventhal, & Moy, 2011b).Currently considered approaches for the future provision of popula-tion statistics includedecennial census-taking,more frequent social sur-veys or administrative (Government held) data linkage and aggregation(ONS, 2013). In contrast, this work explores the possibility of derivingsmall area estimates of traditional socio-economic indicators from ‘dig-ital trace’ or transactional data collected by utility (or other) services aspart of normal service provision. As a number of recent authors havenoted large-scale geo-coded transactional datasets, such as those col-lected in the retail, telecommunications, finance and utilities sectorscould offer opportunities to supplement census based small area statis-tics by supporting the delivery of area-based population statistics, andgenerating novel indicators at a neighbourhood level (Deville et al.,2014; Dugmore et al., 2011b; Struijs, Braaksma, & Daas, 2014). For theUnited Kingdom Statistics Authority, via its executive office the Officefor National Statistics (ONS) in England andWales, the use of commer-cial data to support census taking may therefore help address censususers' requests for more frequent and timely reporting of census-typestatistics in the intercensal periods.the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).59B. Anderson et al. / Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 63 (2017) 58–67Recent related work suggests that commercial ‘big data’ could bothsupport near real time census taking and also provide unique insightsinto household or individual behaviours (Carroll, Lyons, & Denny,2014; Claxton, Reades, & Anderson, 2012; Deville et al., 2014;Douglass, Meyer, Ram, Rideout, & Song, 2015; Dugmore et al., 2011b;Pucci, Manfredini, & Tagliolato, 2015). In this work we consider house-hold level data held by a range of utility companies before focusing inparticular on smart meter derived electricity consumption data. Com-pared to a number of other forms of potentially useful ‘big data’, agrid-connected electricity supply is almost universally available in theUK, almost universally connected to domestic dwellings and meteringof consumption is mandatory. Furthermore the planned universal roll-out of electricity smart meters collecting at least half-hourly consump-tion data (DECC, 2013) means that consideration of the value ofsuitably anonymised and aggregated smart meter data in the produc-tion of official statistics is now timely.The use of this kind of data for market segmentation and other elec-tricity related services has been noted in the literature (McKenna,Richardson, & Thomson, 2012) and was noted by Dugmore et al.(Dugmore et al., 2011b) in the context of future census data collection.However, as far as we are aware only one published study has investi-gated its potential in the development of official and/or small area sta-tistics (Carroll et al., 2014). A growing literature suggests thathousehold level electricity load data, collected via smart metering,could provide considerable opportunities to infer household character-istics (Beckel, Sadamori, & Santini, 2012; Newing, et al., 2015; Struijs etal., 2014) The link between household characteristics and householdenergy consumption is long established and the literature recognisesthat household characteristics will give rise to different load profilesand subsequent demand on the electricity supply network (e.g. seeMcLoughlin, Duffy, & Conlon, 2013 for a summary). Consequently, theenergy sector uses household or area based indicators of householdcomposition and characteristics to predict electricity ‘demand’ in orderto manage networks and target interventions designed to reduce ortime-shift peak loads (e.g. see Elexon, 2013; Hamidi, Li, & Robinson,2009; Wright & Firth, 2007).The purpose of this work is to explore the value of inverting this ap-proach to assess the feasibility of using observed high temporal resolu-tion electricity consumption data to infer household characteristics as afirst step in the aggregation of household characteristics to form ‘nor-mal’ area level population statistics. It should be emphasised thereforethat the overall objective is not to characterise or ‘profile’ individualhouseholds, rather we seek to aggregate inferred household character-istics to develop area based ‘neighbourhood’ indicators similar to or incombination with Census estimates or other appropriate datasets.Thiswork briefly reviews the future provision of area based statisticsin the UK, recognising the opportunities to enhance or supplement thecensus taking process with digital trace data. It then considers the ex-tent to which digital trace data from the commercial sector could repre-sent a novel tool to generate census type small-area statistics, beforefocusing on the use high resolution electricity consumption monitoringdata collected via smart metering. Based on preliminary analyses of a‘smart meter-like’ dataset the research highlights the potential valueof the approach and then discusses significant challenges and concludesby setting out a research programme which could systematically testthe value of the approach.2. Future provision of area based population statistics in the UKAs a consistent and robust source of small area population statistics,the United Kingdom census is used to allocate billions of pounds of gov-ernment and commercial investment at the local level. It represents afundamental tool for market research, policy making, commercial deci-sionmaking, resource allocation and for academic research (ONS, 2013;Watson, 2009). Estimates of population counts by age and sex are a keycensus output, yet the detailed attribute information related tohouseholds and their usual residents - determining characteristicssuch as ethnic composition, education, socio-economic status, religionand employment – offer greatest value to the academic and commercialsector.Census data are notmade available at the individual household levelbut are published as non-disclosive aggregated counts within a hierar-chy of ‘output zones’ or areas. These are built from unit postcodes, de-signed for the release of aggregate population statistics and representsmall areas ranging from Output Areas (OAs – typically containingaround 125 households) through to local authority districts (LADs) orUnitary Authorities (UAs). The former represents an important analyti-cal unit for resource allocation and policymaking at the local level, espe-cially within the commercial sector (Dugmore, 2013; ONS, 2014a). It isthis combination of universal geographic coverage at the small arealevel coupled with detailed attribute data that represents a majorstrength of the census (House of Commons Treasury Committee, 2008).However, inevitably increasing costs, difficulties of ensuring full re-sponse, concerns over the decadal reporting cycle and the two yeartime-lag between census-taking and the delivery of initial outputs hasgiven rise to a search for alternatives (Dugmore et al., 2011b). Thiswork has been conducted by the ONS ‘Beyond 2011’ programme(ONS, 2014a) and, together with subsequent reviews of internationalcensus taking practice (see for example Dugmore, Furness, Leventhal,and Moy (2011a); and Martin (2006)), has highlighted a variety of ap-proaches to collecting area based statistics including the use of govern-mental administrative sources (e.g. Netherlands and Denmark) or arolling census (France). However the work also showed that a numberof options under consideration by ‘Beyond 2011’, particularly thosedriven by administrative data, were unable to provide the level ofsocio-economic attribute data that many census users rely upon forcommercial analysis, policy making and resource allocation (Calder &Teague, 2013; ONS, 2014a). Additionally, concerns have been raisedover the likely success and practicalities of a census based on an admin-istrative or register based system given the lack of a population registerwithin the UK (Skinner, Hollis, & Murphy, 2013).Based on the recommendations of the Beyond 2011 program (ONS,2014a) on, extensive user consultation (ONS, 2014b) and an indepen-dent review (Skinner et al., 2013), the UK Statistics Authority recom-mended to parliament that a ‘traditional’ decadal census should becarried out in 2021 (Dilnot, 2014). They also noted that this should beprimarily carried out online and that the considerable potential ofutilising administrative data and larger scale household surveys as asupplement to census based statistics should be developed further(Dilnot, 2014).Whilst recognising that data held by commercial organisations mayoffer more cost effective or timely reporting (Dugmore et al., 2011b),this avenue has received far less attention and discussion has tendedto refer only to ‘customer information’ recorded in customer service da-tabases and/or retail transaction data. As far as we are aware, commer-cial data does not currently featurewithin the national statistical censustaking or population statistics of any nation. As Struijs et al. (2014) notesuch data could be used to provide substantial additional data over andabove basic address listings.3. Smart meters for a Smart CensusThe nascent roll-out of domestic electricity smart meters in a num-ber of major markets including the US, China, Brazil, India and Japan(Deloitte, 2011) and the UK (DECC, 2012) provides an opportunity forthe exploration of precisely the scenario described above.In the UK, smart meters incorporate communication infrastructureallowing them to transmit near real-time energy usage data to inhomedisplay units (IHDs), to energy demand service operators selectedby the customer and to a centralised data retrieval service to extracthalf-hourly data from all smart meters for use by energy suppliers (bill-ing and fraud prevention); network operators (network management)Table 1Irish CER Smart Meter Trial Household samples.Sample NHouseholds who completed the 2009 pre-trial survey 4232Households with valid consumption data in October 2009 3488Households who completed the 2010 survey 3422Households who completed both surveys and had valid consumptionrecords314460 B. Anderson et al. / Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 63 (2017) 58–67or other authorised third parties (e.g. switching agencies). Unlike otherhousehold level transactional data sources, the universal coverage andsingular data access gateway suggests that electricity consumptiondata could represent a valuable data source for research and policymaking.A growing literature suggests that household level electricity loaddata, collected via smart metering, could provide considerable opportu-nities to infer household characteristics (Beckel et al., 2012; Newing etal., 2015; Struijs et al., 2014). The link between household characteris-tics and household energy consumption is long established and the lit-erature recognises that household characteristics will give rise todifferent load profiles and subsequent demand on the electricity supplynetwork (Wright & Firth, 2007; Hamidi et al., 2009; Elexon, 2013;McLoughlin et al., 2013). In this work we assess the feasibility ofinverting this approach anduse observed high temporal resolution elec-tricity loads in order to infer household characteristics. It should benoted, however, that the overall intention is not to characterise or ‘pro-file’ individual households, but to develop area based ‘neighbourhood’indicators for policy making and the delivery of population statisticsand social indicators.We have previously used the term ‘Smart Censuses’ (Newing et al.,2015) in reference to the potential generation of area based populationstatistics and area based indicators inferred via smart metering. First,however, it is necessary to demonstrate that smart metered electricityload data can be used as a tool to accurately infer household character-istics. In this work we make use of a smart-meter like dataset, intro-duced in the following section. We use this dataset to generate aseries of summary statistics and indices (‘profile indicators’) to describethe shape and characteristics of household load profiles. We then usemulti-level regression modelling techniques to test the extent towhich such load profile indicators have the potential to predict keyhousehold characteristics.4. A smart meter-like datasetPreliminary work conducted with a small smart-meter like datasetfrom a University of Southampton energy demand reduction projectshowed some evidence of differences in load profiles for differenttypes of households (Newing et al., 2015). However the small samplesize and relative homogeneity of the household sample led us to follow(McLoughlin, Duffy, & Conlon, 2012) and exploit a much larger smart-meter like dataset from the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation's(CER) Smart Metering Electricity Customer Behaviour Trials (CBTs).1The purpose of the trials, which took place from 2009 to 2010was to as-sess the impact of various tariff regimes and feedback methods on con-sumers' electricity consumption. In order to do this the trial recruitedover 3000 Irish households who were equipped with electricity con-sumption monitors before being allocated to control and interventiongroups. All households were surveyed during the baseline (2009) andagain during the post-trial (2010) stages to gather information onhousehold composition, appliance ownership and usage and socio-eco-nomic status. Overall, as Table 1 shows, some 4232 households com-pleted the initial survey but only 3487 had fully functioning half-hourly consumption monitors in October 2009 at the start of the base-line period. In total 3143 completed both surveys andhad full consump-tion records for the entire trial period.In order to reduce the processing and analysis time, avoidmajor hol-idays and exclude potentially confounding seasonal variation, fourweeks of data from mid-week days (Tues, Wednesday and Thursday)in late September and early October 2009 was selected for analysis.The selection of mid-week days was guided by previous work suggest-ing that there is greater differentiation in loadprofiles for different kinds1 Accessed via the Irish Social Science Data Archive - http://www.ucd.ie/issda/data/commissionforenergyregulationcer/.of households during the week compared to weekends (Newing et al.,2015).Table 2 shows summary statistics for the mid-week household con-sumption for this period and indicates the extent towhich consumptionis positively skewed. Table 3 extends this analysis to show that variationin half hourly consumption increases as the number of residents in-creases, as does the mean total consumption over the period and alsothe mean consumption per half hour.Some 2% of households used electricity storage heaters as their mainmeans of heating while 28% used gas, 42% used oil and 26% used solidfuels. It was therefore considered unlikely that the use of electricity forheating would substantially affect the analysis. On the other hand, atleast 19% of the households used electric immersion heaters as theirsource of hot water. We acknowledge that the use of such appliancescould introduce artefacts into the kinds of consumption patternswe dis-cuss below. However in the future census collection context we pro-pose, the presence of hot water immersion heaters would beunknown and so must be accepted as a potential source of error in theestimation of household attributes. More detailed analysis of individualdwelling level consumption patterns could attempt to identify and con-trol for electricity consumption of this kind but due to its computationalcomplexity (Zoha, Gluhak, Imran, & Rajasegarar, 2012) this was consid-ered outside the scope of the current paper.Other sources of variation in electricity consumption include exter-nal temperature, the ownership of more (or less) energy efficient appli-ances and on-site electricity generation through solar panels ordomestic wind turbines. By using a single month in the Autumn of2009 in Ireland we attempt to control for temperature fluctuations be-tween households and therefore assume that all dwellings were ex-posed to the same climatic conditions. We do not take into accountownership of different kinds of appliances as this could not be knownat the household level in the context we propose and so would contrib-ute to ‘error’ in our estimations. Finally only 1% of trial households re-ported using “Renewable (e.g. solar)” for heating and 2% for hot waterand we take this as an indicator that the depression of measuredpower import from the grid due to within-dwelling generation is un-likely to cause problems in the analysis.4.1. Electricity load profilesThe half-hourly resolution electricity consumption data collectedduring the four week period in October 2011 corresponds to the defaulttemporal reporting interval specified by the UK smart meter roll-outprogramme (Energy UK, 2013) and is generally considered to be ade-quate for load profile analysis (Beckel, Sadamori, & Santini, 2013).As an example, Fig. 1 shows temporal load profiles for different kindsof households using this data and exhibits a familiar shape, with pro-nounced morning (for those in work) and evening peaks potentiallydriven by active household occupancy and use of household appliancesat these times of the day. The literature suggests that a households' con-sumption profile tends to be fairly consistent on a day-to-day basis(Ning & Kirschen, 2010), no doubt driven by similar routines, behav-iours and occupancy patterns.A number of studies have confirmed the impact of household com-position, dwelling characteristics and householder behaviours on suchload profiles (Beckel et al., 2012; Druckman & Jackson, 2008; Firth,Table 2Descriptive statistics for mid-week electricity consumption in kWh for the household sample (mid-week days) – October 2009.Variable N Mean SD Median Min Max Skew KurtosisAll half-hours 2,009,088 0.48 0.64 0.24 0 10.44 3.15 14.102:00–05:00 (baseload half-hours) 334,848 0.19 0.21 0.14 0 6 6.19 70.916:00–20:00 (evening Peak half-hours) 418,560 0.71 0.82 0.4 0 10.44 2.34 7.51Daily sum per household 55,808 17.35 14.87 15.74 0 158.13 0.94 1.5361B. Anderson et al. / Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 63 (2017) 58–67Lomas,Wright, &Wall, 2008; Owen, 2012;Wright, 2008). Temporal pe-riodswhere the greatest inter-household variability in load profilesmaybe evident, such as the evening peak period, could offer greatest value inidentifying household characteristics, on the assumption that it is differ-ences in those characteristics which are likely to drive differences inhousehold behaviour and routines, and thus loads at these times ofthe day. Recent findings (Newing et al., 2015) suggest that the load pro-files for our study households exhibit a number of key features whichmay assist in differentiating between households based on theircharacteristics.4.2. Linked household survey dataThe CER electricity consumption dataset is linked to survey data thatincorporates a number of household characteristics of potential interestin the production of small area population statistics. These includehouseholder and dwelling characteristics directly comparable withexisting area based population statistics (such as dwelling type, numberof residents and employment status) alongside indicators not currentlypart of small area data collection but of considerable relevance to policymakers (such as income), as Table 4 makes clear.For policy applications, dwelling size (and in particular the numberof bedrooms) is an important indicator of household level overcrowd-ing, used primarily by local authorities to tackle housing issues. Follow-ing the 2011 census, this information has been reported as an‘occupancy rating’ (relating the number of bedrooms to the number ofusually resident occupants) and notions of household overcrowdingand under-occupancy have also become policy relevant in the wake ofthe welfare reforms in the UK, whereby available benefits are cut ifclaimants have a spare bedroomwithin a council or housing associationprovided home (Ramsden, 2014). The existing literature provides evi-dence that dwelling floor area is linked to electricity consumption(Table 4) and we assess the extent to which, based on our sample,load profiles can be used to infer household floor area. This could inturn be used to estimate the number of bedrooms in order to generatea more policy-relevant indicator.Household income does not form part of small area population sta-tistics, yet represents an indicator of considerable value topolicymakersand the commercial sector, with its link to electricity loads wellestablished (Table 4). In spite of frequent calls for its inclusion, plansto collect this information within the 2011 UK census were droppedamidst concerns of under-response driven by the perceived intrusionposed by an income question. Income is an important indicator ofTable 3Descriptive statistics for half hourly mid-week electricity consumption in kWh for the househoN households N half-hours Mean total consumption per hou1 person 699 402,624 161.502 people 134 77,184 247.813 people 1702 980,928 285.524 people 511 294,336 325.225+ people 441 254,016 384.35economic well-being and the lack of information on income availablevia population statistics is frequently cited as a weakness (See e.g.Dugmore et al., 2011b). The CER survey recorded household responseperson's self-reported net annual income via income bands.Employment status is reported via population statistics in relation toeconomic activity, and forms an important tool at the local, regional andnational level for policy making and intervention, enabling householdclassification and acting as a predictor of behaviours and routines. Theliterature clearly identifies that employment status impacts upon thetiming of electricity loads (Table 4). Household response person (HRP)employment status formed part of the CER survey with over 59% ofstudyHRPs in employment (incorporating full time, part time, freelanceand self-employment), almost 30% were retired, with the remaining11% representing HRPs not in active employment through unemploy-ment, study or full time care duties. The latter categories have beencombined with retired households for subsequent analysis, giving twogroups; ‘Employed’ and ‘Not in active employment’. Householder employ-ment status should, however, be treatedwith some caution. Self-report-ed employment status must be treated as an indicator only as responsecategories provided by the survey did not account for the full range ofnuanced employment patterns that may exist, such as homeworkingand flexible working arrangements which would impact considerablyon behaviours, routines and domestic electricity loads.It would, however, be an oversimplification to suggest that charac-teristics such as these could be predicted solely on the basis of house-hold electricity consumption. The literature clearly identifies that loadprofiles are also a function of the number of household residents, andthe household composition, the latter referring to the age structureand presence of children which may drive routines associated with ed-ucation, for example (Druckman & Jackson, 2008; Firth et al., 2008;Owen, 2012; Wright, 2008; Zimmerman et al., 2012). The surveydataset collected information on household composition, noting thepresence of children and presence of seniors, plus a count of the numberof household residents. Information of this nature is commonly collect-ed via the Census, household social surveys and a range of administra-tive datasets. ONS recommendations to parliament following the‘Beyond2011’ programme noted the important role of administrativedata as a future source of information on household composition withpotential to provide population counts and basic household composi-tion at the small-area or address level (ONS, 2013, 2014a). Thus withinthis analysis we do not attempt to predict these characteristics; ratherthey represent predictors that we assume would be available at thesmall area level from administrative data.

The following section outlines a se-ries of indicators that can be used to summarise electricity loads for usein subsequent analysis.5. Profile indicators and household characteristicsSmart-meter like datasets such as the CER study present a number ofchallenges related to data storage, manipulation and analysis (Graham& Shelton, 2013).

Even for just 3488 households over a four-week period, the thirty minute resolution measurement generatedover 4.6 million records. To simplify the analysis we used a series of pa-rameters or ‘profile indicators’ to summarise some of the temporal andmagnitudinal features of household load profiles, facilitating compari-son between households whilst also reducing the volume of data to beprocessed.The literature provides a number of examples of indicators de-rived from load profiles as listed in Table 5. These indicators considercharacteristics including load magnitude (base load, peak load),summary statistics (e.g. mean load), temporal properties such asthe timing and duration of key features (e.g. time of use [max]) andratios of, for example, peak to off-peak loads. Thus profile indicatorsprovided a series of summary measures for each household whilstalso helping preserve household privacy and removing redundantdata. The process also considerably smoothed data on a household-by-household basis, reducing the impact of very rare or atypicalhigh load events (Williams, 2013). Nevertheless, the literature sug-gests that profile indicators maintain the ability to differentiate be-tween households based on key features of their loads, such as themagnitude or timing of their peak load (McLoughlin, 2013). Theuse of profile indicators could thus offer considerable advantages ifthis form of analysis were up-scaled to incorporate far larger samplesof households and time series of the order of months rather thanweeks, with a commensurate increase in the volume of data to bestored, manipulated and handled.As noted above we calculated the profile indicators listed in Table 1over the midweek day (Tuesday – Thursday) periods based on the as-sumption that habits and routines associated with employment orstudy, which could reveal important household characteristics, will bemore evident on weekdays. We have excluded Mondays and Fridaysas these represent transition points with the weekend and householdsmay thus exhibit atypical weekday behaviours.Since all indicators summarise characteristics of the same load pro-files, there may be a tendency for indicators to be strongly associatedwith each other, especially where they represent similar measures ofmagnitude. The ‘Morning Maximum’, ‘Total Power Consumed’ and‘97.5th percentile load’ are likely to be strongly correlated and thereforecare is used when applying these indicators in subsequent analysis, en-suring that highly correlated indicators are not incorporated togetherwithin regressions or classifications. However, no indicators have beendiscounted as both the literature and prior exploratory analyses sug-gests that these indicators may reveal different householdTable 5Parameters or ‘profile indicators’ to describe magnitude and temporal characteristics of load profiles.Parameter Description Source(s) Possible predictor of…Base load Mean load 2 am–5 am (Yohanis et al., 2008) Number of Residents,size of dwelling97.5th percentileLoad97.5th percentile of ranked load – used rather than peak load which often represents anextreme peak value, driven by very short-term use of high power equipment(Price, 2010) Income, employmentstatusLoad factor Ratio of mean daily load to maximum daily load (Carroll et al., 2014;McLoughlin et al., 2012)Employment status,presence of childrenLunchtime load Mean load between midday and 2 pm (Chicco, Napoli, Postolache,Scutariu, & Toader, 2001)Presence of seniorsMean load Mean load across all timestamps (Beckel et al., 2012; Yohanis etal., 2008)Number of residentsMorning maximum Maximum load between 6 am and 10.30 am (Carroll et al., 2014) Presence of childrenEveningconsumptionFactor (ECF)Mean load during the evening peak (4 pm–8 pm) relative to the mean load at all other times ofthe day(Powells, Bulkeley, Bell, &Judson, 2014)Employment statusTotal powerconsumedTotal power consumption (kWh) during the study period (McLoughlin, 2013) Number of residents,income63B.

In the following section we assess the potential value ofthese indicators as predictors of key household characteristics ofinterest.6. Estimating household attributes from load profilesThe literature, industry practice and our own exploratory analysissuggests that key features of household load profiles, as summarisedvia the profile indicators presented in Table 5, may be able to estimatea number of household attributes. We argue that exploring the valueof such indicators for this purpose requires three main steps. The firstis to use a multi-level mixed effects framework to identify whether ornot known household characteristics can predict load profile indicatorswhere those indicators are measured multiple times for each house-hold. The second is to use the results of this step to select themost likelyprofile indicators and reverse themodelling direction to use them to es-timate the household attributes. The final step is to assess the classifica-tion accuracy of these estimates at the household level.6.1. Predicting profile indicators using household characteristicsThe first step in this process used a multilevel regression modellingapproach to allow for the appropriate modelling of repeated profile in-dicator measurements over the 3 day ∗ 4 week = 12 days observed foreach household. The models were constructed using a mixed effectsframework as follows:yit ¼ β0 þ β1x1it þ…β5x5it þ u0i þ εitu0i  N 0;σ20u Table 6Coding of explanatory variables for multilevel models.Explanatory variable Coding schemeIncome 6 income bands:b7,500 eurob22,500b40,000b62,500b92,500N92,500Self-reported employmentstatus of HRP0 = in paid work, 1 = not in paid work(unemployed, retired or caring role)Presence of children 0 = no children, 1 = 1+ childNumber of residents 0 = 1 or 2 residents of any age, 1 = 3+ residentsεit  N 0;σ2ε where the dependent variable yit is a profile indicator measurement forhousehold i at time t, x1it,…, x5it are the explanatory variables (see Table6) for household i at time t. β1to β5 are FE coefficients, representing theFE part of the model. u0i is the RE on the intercept, which representshow an individual household differs from the average household. It isnormally distributed with mean 0, variance σ0u2 . εit is the within-group residual with normal distribution of mean 0 and variance σε2.Overall the results, which are summarised in Table 7, suggest thatthe number of residents and the presence of children are both statisti-cally significant predictors of several mid-week consumption profile in-dicators, especially those reflecting the overall magnitude ofconsumption. Further, more detailed analysis using nested models(not shown) suggest that the inclusion of the Household ResponsePerson's employment status modifies the effect of the number of resi-dents and the presence of children for several profile indicators.Income and (un)employment status are clearly correlated and so aswe would expect the inclusion of one to largely mask the effects of theother for most profile indicators although this is not the case for themean baseload which is significantly predicted by income even whenthe number of residents is controlled.(Un)employment status appears to predict the evening consump-tion factor as wemight expect from Fig. 1 and Table 5. However the rel-atively high residual value for this model (64%) suggests that it is lessrobust than the load factor model (47%).6.2. Predicting household characteristics using profile indicatorsThe second step was then to reverse the modelling process and testthat ability of the load profile indicators to correctly predict householdattributes. As noted above it was assumed that the number of residentsand the number of children was already known through potentiallyavailable administrative data sources and thework reported here focus-es only on the household response person's employment status as anexemplar.A logistic regression approach was therefore used to estimate theprobability that a Household Response Person (HRP) was not in paidwork on the basis of number of residents, the number of children andthe profile indicators selected as being most likely to be of value inTable 7 based on their ability to predict the HRP work status in the ab-sence of other factors (ECF and LF). By applying a success threshold of50% an estimate of the percentage of correctly classified HRPs couldthen be calculated as a simple within-sample validation test.The results of this initial model (model 1) are shown in Table 8 andthey suggest that whilst the evening consumption factor and load factorTable 7Effectiveness of household characteristics in predicting electricity consumption ‘profile indicators’ (values in bold are significant at the 95% level).Daily peak time Daily peak 06:00 to 10.30 Daily mean baseload (02:00–05:00) Daily meanbeta Z beta Z beta Z beta ZConstant 39.9 7.74 −0.80 −3.10 −0.27 −2.66 −0.44 −2.02Number of residents −0.19 −0.22 0.21 4.94 0.06 3.73 0.24 6.63Income band −0.72 −1.45 0.10 3.88 0.04 3.75 0.07 3.10Number of children 0.27 0.42 0.17 5.32 0.00 0.38 0.11 4.21Employment status of HRP −1.01 −0.92 0.13 2.43 0.05 2.44 0.11 2.27Marginal R2 0% 15% 7% 20%Conditional R2 20% 63% 64% 81%Residual R2 80% 37% 36% 19%Daily sum Daily 97.5th percentile Evening consumption factor Load factorbeta Z beta Z beta Z beta ZConstant −21.69 −2.05 −0.03 −0.05 1.72 4.24 0.08 1.10Number of residents 11.64 6.69 0.83 6.77 0.06 0.90 0.00 −0.09Income band 3.17 3.12 0.10 1.42 −0.02 −0.49 0.01 1.69Number of children 5.49 4.22 0.44 4.81 0.08 1.59 0.00 0.21Employment status of HRP 5.01 2.22 0.06 0.36 −0.18 −2.14 0.04 2.14Marginal R2 20% 16% 1% 1%Conditional R2 81% 66% 36% 53%Residual R2 19% 34% 64% 47%64 B. Anderson et al. / Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 63 (2017) 58–67both had statistically significant predictive effects, the model was onlyable to correctly predict HRP unemployment status in around 65% ofcases.In order to improve the performance and to test the relative value ofthe profile indicators and the ‘known’ demographic variables (numberof residents and number of children), we estimated a series of increas-inglymore complexmodels. Thus basemodel 2.1 (see Table 9) includedjust the evening consumption factor (ECF) and the Load Factor (LF) aswas the case for model 1 but did not include the number of residentsor presence of children. Despite this the results suggest that nearly60% of HRPs were correctly classified.In an attempt to improve classification performance we drew onMcLoughlin et al. (McLoughlin et al., 2013) to develop clusters of house-holds with similar consumption profiles. Cluster membership was cal-culated via a weighted least squares and k-means clustering processusing only the half-hour consumption profiles. This produced six clus-ters of households of which two captured themajority (33% and 28% re-spectively) with the remainder distributed roughly evenly across theremaining four. As Table 9 shows the inclusion of these clusters in-creased the performance of themodel by just under 5 percentage points(model 2.2) with only membership of cluster 3 proving not to be a sta-tistically significant predictor.In order to improve the model still further (model 2.3) we then in-cluded an indicator of ‘habitual behaviour’ by calculating an autocorre-lation coefficient for the 24 h lag of each half hourly consumption foreach household on mid-week days after the hours of sleep (00:00–06:00) were removed to avoid artificially increasing the lag correlation.This coefficient is therefore an indicator of the degree to which mid-week consumption between 06:00 and 00:00 is replicated at the sametime on subsequent days for each household and, based on exploratoryanalysis (not shown) we expected lower autocorrelation (less ‘regularhabits’) for those not in paid work. In general as Fig. 2 shows the coeffi-cients followed an expected 24 h profile with the highest being theTable 8Logistic regression modelling results for HRP unemployment status (model 1).Beta t p valueNumber of residents b 3 0.42 2.30 0.02Number of residents ≥ 3 −0.70 −7.90 0.00Children present −1.87 −16.82 0.00Evening consumption factor (ECF) −0.15 −2.59 0.01Load factor (LF) 1.93 3.38 0.00Correct prediction: 65.42%immediately following half hours before a gentle decline and then riseto a higher correlation at the 24 h lag (i.e. the same time the next day)which in this case is represented by the 36th lag due to the removal ofsleep hours. The model included the coefficients at lags 36 (the sametime tomorrow) and 72 (the day after tomorrow) however as Table 9shows, the inclusion of this habituality indicator produced a marginalimprovement in performance with only the lag 36 coefficient provingto be statistically significant.Finally (model 2.4) we re-introduced the presence of children andhousehold size variables to understand the additional value of this po-tentially administratively sourced data. As Table 9 shows, the increas-ingly complex models were significantly different from the simplerversions (LR test results) while the adjusted pseudo r-squared scores(McFadden) also increased as the additional variables were addedreflecting increased improvement over the intercept model in eachcase. Re-adding the presence of children and dummy for larger house-holds increased the pseudo r-squared score substantially and the classi-fication success by 6.2 percentage points and, as might be expected,reduced the predictive power of the ECF as well as most clustermembership.Overall, these results suggest that model 2.4 is most comprehensiveamong the list of models tested, with significant predictors approximat-ing household energy usages, energy usage behaviours and administra-tive variables. Our simplest model (model 2.1) indicates that althoughthe absence of administrative data reduced the ability of electricity con-sumption profile indicators to predict HRP employment status, the suc-cess rate was still close to 60%. This, together with the relativelyunchanging regression coefficients for the profile indicators in eachmodel suggests that most of the differentiation captured by the profileclusters and all of that captured by the ‘habitual behaviour’ indicatormay already be embodied in the profile indicators used in model 2.1.7. Conclusions and next stepsThis paper has started the process of assessing the feasibility of usinghousehold electricity load profiles as a tool to infer key household char-acteristics. Using a smart meter-like dataset, we generated a series ofload profile indicators that summarise key features of household loadprofiles, enabling differentiation between households. These indicators,coupled with household composition, offered a degree of predictive po-tential for the characteristic tested and, when compositional data wasexcluded but other consumption indicators included, this potentialwas still substantial especially when membership of twenty four hourTable 9Logistic regression modelling results for HRP employment status.Model 2.1: base model Model 2.2: with clustermembershipModel 2.3: with 24 hautocorrelationcoefficientModel 2.4 withpresence of childrenand 3+ personsExplanatory variable Coefficient p Coefficient p Coefficient p Coefficient pIntercept −0.312 0.074 −1.199 0.000 −1.238 0.000 −0.164 0.514Evening consumption factor −0.260 0.000 −0.235 0.000 −0.176 0.001 −0.062 0.260Load factor 1.947 0.000 3.038 0.000 3.477 0.000 3.324 0.000Cluster 2 membership (compared to cluster 1) −0.354 0.047 −0.251 0.164 −0.500 0.011Cluster 3 membership −0.346 0.173 −0.318 0.212 −0.525 0.058Cluster 4 membership 0.702 0.000 0.728 0.000 0.040 0.823Cluster 5 membership 0.846 0.000 0.829 0.000 0.477 0.011Cluster 6 membership 1.039 0.000 1.045 0.000 0.019 0.916Lag 36 coefficient −0.278 0.574 −0.641 0.218Lag 72 coefficient −1.351 0.010 −1.010 0.069Presence of children −1.471 0.0003+ persons −0.860 0.000N 3160 3160 3160 3160McFadden Pseudo R2 0.024 0.067 0.075 0.150LR tests:Model 2.1 v 2.2 p b 0.0001Model 2.2 v 2.3 p = 0.0001Model 2.3 v 2.4 p b 0.0001Classification rate 59.3% 63.8% 63.9% 70.1%65B. Anderson et al. / Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 63 (2017) 58–67demand profile clusters was included. This suggests that electricity con-sumption data of this kind could be used to independently estimate theemployment status of HRPs as ameans of validating (or contributing to)Census estimates and it could also be used to produce slightly less ro-bust estimates in the absence of administrative data. This may be espe-cially pertinent to mid-census period estimates or to situations whereonly smart meter data is available whichmaywell be the case for stake-holders who do not have access to Government held administrativedata sources.However it must be recognised that the size of the sample used inthis work has precluded the testing of the differential performance ofthe process in different sub-populations or in different regions. In bothcases we would expect reduced heterogeneity and thus increased per-formance of the estimation process. Whilst it would in principle be pos-sible to develop the work to test larger sub-groups of this sample, weconcluded that the consequential reduction in statistical power wouldmean that such work requires a much larger representative populationFig. 2.Mean and standard deviation of AR coefficiesample. Further the lack of any geo-coding in the data also precludesanalysis of regional differences within the sample itself.The use of load profile indicators may also be over-simplifying thenuanced detail within the load profiles. Given that the range of house-hold types available within the dataset is relatively narrow, detailedtemporal electricity consumption behaviour not captured by the profileindictors may be useful in order to discriminate between households.Whilst evidence from the literature suggests that profile indicators arefrequently used to extract meaningful information from load profiles,it may be beneficial to work with more of the time-series data inorder to ensure that the profile indicators do not mask habits whichmay prove useful in differentiating between households. Such an ap-proach may provide opportunities to build regression models or gener-ate clusters for different days of the week, recognising that load profilesmay be very different on weekdays and at weekends, and that the dif-ference between weekday and weekend profiles may, for example,allow inferences to be made about household characteristics whilstnt by lag for mid-week days in October 2009.66 B. Anderson et al. / Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 63 (2017) 58–67differences between seasons and school vs non-school holiday periodsmay also be instructive.Overall the analysis confirms existing literature suggesting that pro-file indicators are potentially useful summaries of key features of house-hold electricity load profiles. The findings suggest that analyticapproaches such as regression and classification could offer potentialin inferring key small area household characteristics from load profileindicators and basic household composition. This approach could addconsiderable additional ‘value’ to domestic smartmetering, enabling re-mote and quasi real-time estimation of small area population statistics.However this approach has the potential for impact beyond the de-livery of enhanced population statistics. Unlike existing small area sta-tistics or periodic household sample surveys, quasi-real timeobservation of energy use and behaviours could be used to both targetand assess the impact of neighbourhood or household level (energy)policy or market interventions. Thus these datasets offer the potentialto target area based (energy) policy and to remotely evaluate impactsin near-real time without the need for household sample surveys.The next steps in this work must be to explore additional statisticalmethods to more robustly estimate attributes from consumption pro-files and to test the performance of these models using not only out-of-sample validation of household level estimates but also by aggregat-ing and validating against real Census data.In the case of statistical methods there may be considerable scope todevelop multi-level hierarchical models of the kind proposed for use inthe estimation of historical climate characteristics from sparse proxyobservations (Hughes & Ammann, 2009; Tingley et al., 2012). Suchwork should include the development of appropriate uncertainty mea-sures for both point (household) and aggregated area level estimates.Future work should also consider the potential value of including arealevel and temporal co-variates to enable the function linking the con-sumption profiles to the household attributes to vary spatially andover time.In terms of household level validation, it is possible that the Irish CERdata set used in this paper may be sufficiently large to support out-of-sample validation but doing so is likely to considerably increase uncer-tainty. It is likely that such validation will only become possible whensubstantially larger samples of suitably linked consumption and house-hold attribute data become available. Such data would also support thekind of sub-population and sub-regional analysis discussed above.Finally, area level validation of aggregated estimates would requireaccess to anonymised large-scale smart meter data extracts from eitherall households or a representative sample of them in known small areageographies which could be used as the basis for model-based estima-tion of household characteristics. These estimates could then be aggre-gated to current Census geographies and validated against recentlyobserved Census-derived population statistics. Unfortunately as far aswe are aware, such large scale geo-coded datasets do not currentlyexist in the UK.ReferencesBeckel, C., Sadamori, L., & Santini, S. (2012).
