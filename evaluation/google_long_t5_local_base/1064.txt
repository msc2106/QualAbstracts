ABSTRACT: 
This paper proposes model selection criteria (MSC) for unconditional moment models using generalized empirical likelihood (GEL) statistics. The use of GEL-statistics in lieu of J-statistics (in the spirit of Andrews, 1999, Econometrica 67, 543-564; and Andrews and Lu, 2001, Journal of Econometrics 101, 123-164) leads to an alternative interpretation of the MSCs that emphasizes the common information-theoretic rationale underlying model selection procedures for both parametric and semiparametric models. The result of this paper also provides a GEL-based model selection alternative to the information criteria-based nonnested tests for generalized method of moments models considered in Kitamura (2000, University of Wisconsin). The results of a Monte Carlo experiment are reported to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the selection criteria and their impact on parameter estimation.

 GENERALIZED EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD–BASED MODEL SELECTION CRITERIA FOR MOMENT CONDITION MODELS HAN HONG AND BRUCE PRESTON Princeton University MATTHEW SHUM Johns Hopkins University This paper proposes model selection criteria ~MSC! for unconditional moment models using generalized empirical likelihood ~GEL! statistics+ The use of GEL- statistics in lieu of J-statistics ~in the spirit of Andrews, 1999, Econometrica 67, 543–564; and Andrews and Lu, 2001, Journal of Econometrics 101, 123–164! leads to an alternative interpretation of the MSCs that emphasizes the common information-theoretic rationale underlying model selection procedures for both para- metric and semiparametric models+ The result of this paper also provides a GEL- based model selection alternative to the information criteria–based nonnested tests for generalized method of moments models considered in Kitamura ~2000, Uni- versity of Wisconsin!+ The results of a Monte Carlo experiment are reported to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the selection criteria and their impact on parameter estimation+ 1. INTRODUCTION Exploiting insights from the recent literature on generalized empirical likeli- hood ~GEL! estimation as an alternative to optimal generalized method of mo- ments ~GMM! estimation ~cf+ Qin and Lawless, 1994; Kitamura and Stutzer, 1997; Kitamura, 1997; Imbens, Spady, and Johnson, 1998; Ahn, Kitamura, and Tripathi, 2001; Newey and Smith, 2000; Smith, 1997!, we propose model and moment selection criteria ~MSC! for unconditional moment condition models based on the GEL statistic, in the spirit of Andrews ~1999! and Andrews and Lu ~2001!+ In these papers,Andrews and Lu investigate MSC for unconditional moment models using the GMM J-statistics ~J-MSC!+ In this paper, we replace The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the NSF ~Hong: SES-0079495, Shum: SES-0003352! and the Fellowship of Woodrow Wilson Scholars ~Preston!+ We thank the co-editor Don Andrews, Xiaohong Chen, John Geweke, Bo Honore, Yuichi Kitamura, Serena Ng, Harry Paarsch, Gautam Tripathi, and two anonymous referees for insightful suggestions and helpful comments+Address correspondence to: Han Hong, Department of Econom- ics, Fisher Hall, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA; e-mail: doubleh@phoenix+Princeton+edu+ Econometric Theory, 19, 2003, 923–943+ Printed in the United States of America+ DOI: 10+10170S0266466603196028 © 2003 Cambridge University Press 0266-4666003 $12+00 923 the J-statistics with the GEL-statistics in the construction of the MSCs+ We also provide GEL analogs of the J-statistic-based “upward” and “downward” test- ing procedures considered in Andrews and Lu ~2001!+ As an example, let ~b, c! denote a pair of model and moment selection vec- tors+1 The GEL-MSC criterion selects the pair of vectors ~b, c! that minimizes GELn~b, c! 2 ~6c 6 2 6b 6! log n, where GELn is the GEL function defined in the next section+ The use of GEL-statistics in lieu of J-statistics allows an alternative interpreta- tion of the MSC and provides an information-theoretical analogy with MSCs in standard parametric likelihood models+ Depending on the choice of the carrier function ~defined subsequently!, the GEL approach ~see Newey and Smith, 2000; Smith, 1997! includes as special cases the empirical likelihood function ~EL! of Qin and Lawless ~1994!, the exponential tilting function ~ET! of Kitamura and Stutzer ~1997!, the Cressie–Read discrepancy statistics ~CR! of Imbens, Spady, and Johnson ~1998!, and the continuous updating GMM function ~CUE! of Hansen, Heaton, and Yaron ~1996!+ For example, when we use EL-based MSC, our proposed selection criterion selects the model with the smallest Kullback- Leibler information criterion ~KLIC! from the true underlying probability mea- sure to the class of probability distributions implied by the moment conditions, and among those with the smallest KLIC it selects the one with the most parsi- monious parameterization ~or with the largest number of overidentification conditions!+ The use of an information-theoretical approach for GMM model selection can be found in Kitamura ~2000! and Ramalho and Smith ~2002!+ Kitamura ~2000! has developed information-theoretic nonparametric likelihood ratio tests to choose between nonnested moment condition models+ Smith ~1997! pro- poses nonnested Cox tests between GMM models using GEL functions+ The results of this paper provide a GEL-based MSC alternative to the nonnested model selection tests of Kitamura ~2000! and the nonnested Cox tests of Ra- malho and Smith ~2002!+ Although the advantage of GEL-MSC is that it facil- itates choice among multiple competing models, it does have the disadvantage of not providing a framework for probabilistic statements to be made regarding the model choice ~see Vuong, 1989!+ In contrast, the likelihood ratio testing approach of Kitamura ~2000! allows probability statements about the choice of the best model in the framework of hypothesis testing+ 2. MODEL SELECTION CRITERIA FOR MOMENT CONDITION MODELS Our notation closely follows Andrews and Lu ~2001!+ Let g~X;g! be the col- lection of moment conditions under consideration+ Let b be the model selection vector that selects the elements of g [ R p to be estimated, i+e+, a p-dimensional vector of 0 and 1’s where 1 indicates that the corresponding parameter element is to be estimated+ Similarly, let c be the r-dimensional moment selection vec- 924 HAN HONG ET AL. tor that selects the moment conditions in g~{! [ Rr to be used in the estima- tion+ Let gb [ b% * %g denote the subvector of g that is estimated and let gc~{! [ c% * %g~{;g! denote the subvector of g~{! that is used in estimation, where % * % denotes Hadamard ~element-by-element! product+ In what follows, we refer to ~b, c! as a pair of moment and model selec- tion vectors+ We use 6c 6 ~resp+ 6b 6! to denote the total number of moments ~resp+ parameters! selected by the pair ~b, c!+ Furthermore, tc denotes the 6c 6-dimensional vector of Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the gc~{! moment conditions selected by c in the construction of the GEL function described subsequently+ Finally, 6c 6 2 6b 6 is the number of overidentifying restrictions, and throughout we assume that the model is identified+ This in particular requires the necessary condition that 6c 6 2 6b 6 $ 0+ We follow Andrews and Lu ~2001! in defining the following sets+ Let BC denote the space of ~b, c! vectors, which can be viewed as the “parameter space” in the moment and model selection procedure+ Furthermore, define the set BCL0 5 $~b, c! [ BC : Egc~{;gb ! 5 0,gb 5 g% * %b, with g [ G%, where Egc~{;gb! denotes the population value of the empirical moment gc~X;gb!+ In other words, BCL0 is the set of “feasible” vectors ~b, c! that select only models and moments that equal zero asymptotically for some parameter vector+ Finally, MBCL0 5 $~b, c! [ BCL0 : 6c 62 6b 6 $ 6c* 62 6b* 6 ∀~b*, c* ! [ BCL0 %+ In short, MBCL0 is the set of “feasible” selection vectors ~b, c! that maximize the quantity 6c 6 2 6b 6, the number of overidentifying restrictions+ Also let #~MBCL0! denote the common values of 6c 6 2 6b 6 for all the elements of MBCL0 + In the rest of the paper we restrict attention to the case when MBCL0 is a singleton+ This implies that the GEL-MSC estimator ~ ZbGMSC , [cGMSC ! defined in the next section converges to a constant and allows for the usual asymptotic distribution for the postselection parameter estimates+ When MBCL0 is not a singleton, although the consistency result of Proposition 1 continues to hold, ~ ZbGMSC , [cGMSC ! may still be random in the limit and the asymptotic distribution for the postselection parameter estimates can be rather involved+ Pötscher ~1991! provides a detailed analysis of this important difference+ 2.1. Generalized Empirical Likelihood-Based Model Selection Criteria The GEL-MSC estimator, ~ ZbGMSC , [cGMSC !, minimizes GEL-based MSC over BC+ The criterion function is defined as GELMSC~b, c! 5 GELn~b, c! 2 h~6c 62 6b 6!kn [ 2n min gb max tc Qn~gb ,tc ! 2 h~6c 62 6b 6!kn , (1) EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD MODEL SELECTION 925 where the GEL function ~Newey and Smith, 2000! is defined as Qn~gb ,tc ! 5 1 n ( t51 n r~tc 'g~Xt ;gb !!+ Both h~{!, a strictly increasing function, and the sequence kn are specified by the researcher+ The carrier function r~v! is a function of a scalar v that is con- cave on its domain V, an open interval containing 0+ It is normalized so that r~0! 5 0, ,r~0! 5 21, and ,2r~0! 5 21, where ,r~{! and ,2r~{! correspond to the first and second derivatives of r~v!, respectively+ Therefore the GEL- MSC is the usual GEL criterion function, augmented by a penalty function that varies with the number of overidentifying restrictions and also with the number of observations+ The GEL function nests several special cases of interest: when r~v! 5 log~1 2 v! the GEL function corresponds to the EL function; for r~v! 5 1 2 e v it corresponds to the ET estimator; and a quadratic r~{! corresponds to the con- tinuous updating estimator+ Discussions of these estimators can be found in Newey and Smith ~2000!+ Throughout the paper we assume that the data Xt are stationary and ergodic+ The following assumptions on h~{! and kn are necessary for the consistency of the GEL-MSCs+ Assumption 1+ h~{! is a strictly increasing function and kn r ` as n r ` and kn 5 o~n!+ As in Andrews and Lu ~2001!, examples of GEL-MSCs that satisfy Assump- tion 1 include analogs of the Bayesian information criterion ~BIC! and Hannan and Quinn information criterion ~HQIC! based on GEL, both of which use h~x! 5 x: GEL-MSC-BIC: kn 5 ln n; GELMSCBIC ~b, c! 5 GELn~b, c! 2 ~6c 62 6b 6! ln n, GEL-MSC-HQIC: kn 5 l ln ln n; GELMSCHQIC ~b, c! 5 GELn~b, c! 2 l{~6c 62 6b 6! ln ln n+ 2.2. Consistency of GEL Model Selection Criteria A moment and model selection estimator ~ Zb, [c! is defined to be consistent if ~ Zb, [c! [ MBCL0 with probability converging to 1+ In the following we give a set of assumptions under which the GEL-MSC estimator ~ ZbGMSC , [cGMSC ! pro- vides a consistent moment and model selection estimator+ These assumptions allow for both random sampling and dependent data+ Assumption 2+ For each ~b, c!

A sufficient condition for the uniqueness of tc~gb! in condition ~2 ' ! of Lemma 1 is that the matrix Egc~Xt ;gb!gc~Xt ;gb!' is strictly positive definite for all ~b, c! and gb [ Gb, because this implies that Er~tc'g~Xt ;gb !! is strictly convex in tc for each gb+ Sufficient conditions for condition ~3'! of Lemma 1, which also imply condition ~1'!, are as follows: ~i! g~Xt ;gb! is uniformly con- tinuous in gb; ~ii! supgb[Gb ,tc[Lc 6r~tc 'g~Xt ;gb !!6 , `; ~iii! Xt are independent and identically distributed ~i+i+d+!+ Condition ~ii! is satisfied if g~Xt ;gb! is uni- formly bounded+ Although beyond the results of this paper, much weaker conditions for uni- form convergence using empirical process theory can be used to accommodate nonsmooth gc~Xt ;gb! ~see, e+g+, Andrews, 1994!+ Moreover, these weaker con- ditions can potentially allow for more general cases such as unbounded values of r~tc'g~Xt ;gb !! for some realizations of Xt , which is important in the context of EL with unbounded moment functions+ Consistency results under general conditions are developed by Newey and Smith ~2000!, who also exploit the concavity properties of the carrier function to bypass uniform convergence con- ditions and obtain Mn -consistency in one step+ Assumption 2 ensures that with probability converging to 1, ~ Zb, [c!

Assume that [gb p& gb* and [tc p & 0 and that the following conditions are satisfied: ( N1) r~{! is twice differentiable with bounded continuous derivatives on its domain V, which includes all realizations of tc'gc~Xt ,gb ! for all tc [ Lc and gb [ Gb.

Then Assumption 3 holds and Mn [tc 5 Op~1! . Note that although Lemmas 1 and 2 assume uniqueness of ~gb*,tc*!, this is not directly used in Assumptions 2 and 3+ It is possible to relax these condi- tions to allow for nonunique gb*,tc*, i+e+, models that are not point identified+ These results are, however, beyond the scope of the paper+ For correctly spec- ified models, the results for Qn~ [gb, [tc! in Newey and Smith ~2000! allow for unidentified moment conditions+ Given these conditions, the next proposition introduces the notion of consis- tency for GEL-based MSC+ Proposition 1+ Under Assumptions 1–3, we have, with probability converg- ing to 1, ~ Zb, [c! [ MBCL0 for the pair ~ Zb, [c! 5 arg max~b, c![BC GELMSC~b, c! . In short, we say that the GEL-based MSC is consistent. Other transformations of the GEL function can also be used to form MSCs+ For example, because log~1 2 x! 5 2x 1 o~x!, the GEL-MSC may be re- defined as 2 n log~1 2 Qn~ [gb , [tc !! 2 h~6c 62 6b 6!kn with corresponding conditions on kn+ In particular, in the case of exponential tilting, Qn~gb,tc! 5 10n (t51n ~1 2 etc 'g~Xt ;gb ! !, and log~1 2 Qn~ [gb, [tc!! corre- sponds to the KLIC from the implied distribution to the true distribution in Kitamura and Stutzer ~1997!+ 928 HAN HONG ET AL. 2.3. Time Series Data The results of the previous section apply to both random sampling data and dependent data+ For time series data, under suitable stationarity, ergodicity, and weak dependence conditions, condition ~3! of Lemma ~2! typically holds with ~see, e+g+, Andrews, 1991; Newey and West, 1987! 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ;gb*! d & N~0,S! where S 5 ( j52` ` Egc~Xt ,gb*!gc~Xt2j ,gb*!+ For i+i+d+ data, S 5 Vc~gb*! and the GEL estimator [gb is as efficient as the op- timally weighted GMM estimator for ~b, c! [ MBCL0 + For time series data, although the GEL-MSC in the previous section is still consistent by Proposi- tion 1, the estimator [gb is typically less efficient than the optimally weighted GMM+ To achieve efficiency with dependent data, the blocking methods of Kita- mura and Stutzer ~1997! ~in the special case of ET! and Smith ~1997! can be used to smooth the observations in constructing the GEL function+ These au- thors define the blockwise GEL objective function as OQn~gb ,tc ! 5 1 n ( t51 n r~tc ' [gc~Xt ;gb !! where [gc~Xt ;gb ! 5 1 2K 1 1 (k52K K gc~Xt2k ;gb ! and the blocks are constructed so that K r ` and K0Mn r 0+ In what follows, we briefly discuss the modifications needed when OQn~gb,tc! is used in place of Qn~gb,tc! in constructing consistent GEL-MSCs+ We only outline the results based on Kitamura and Stutzer ~1997! and Smith ~1997! and refer the reader to these papers for the complete set of stationary and weak dependence condi- tions and other regularity conditions that validate the blockwise GEL approach+ When ~b, c!

Testing Procedure Given the general consistency result of GEL-based MSC, we also describe the GEL analogs of two algorithms proposed in Andrews ~1999! and Andrews and EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD MODEL SELECTION 929 Lu ~2001! to choose ~b, c! consistently+ In the following discussion we will focus on Qn~gb,tc! rather than OQn~gb,tc!+ 2.4.1. Downward testing procedure. Andrews and Lu ~2001! define the downward-testing model selection procedure as follows+ Starting with vectors ~b, c! [ BC for which 6c 6 2 6b 6 ~the number of overidentifying restrictions! is the largest, perform tests ~described in detail subsequently! with progressively smaller 6c 6 2 6b 6 ~therefore the name “downward” testing! until a test is found that cannot reject the null hypothesis that the moment conditions considered are all correct for the given model+ ~Note that for each value of 6c 6 2 6b 6, tests are carried out for each ~b, c! in BC with this value of 6c 6 2 6b 6+! Let ZkDT de- note the number of overidentifying restrictions ~i+e+, 6c 62 6b 6! for this first test found to not reject the null+ Given ZkDT , the downward testing estimator ~ ZbDT , [cDT ! is the vector that maximizes GELn~b, c! over ~b, c! [ BC with 6c 62 6b 65 ZkDT + More formally, consider the GEL statistic: GELn~b, c! 5 2nQn~ [gb, [tc!+ Under Assumptions 2 and 3, if the moment conditions are correctly specified ~in the sense that tc* 5 0 for the limit GEL problem mingb maxtc @Er~tc 'g~Xt ;gb !!# !, then GELn~b, c! 5 Op~1!+2 The downward-testing procedure looks for the first acceptance among ~b, c!

[ BC that have the smallest number of overidentifying restrictions 6c 6 2 6b 6, we perform tests ~analogous to those described for the downward- testing procedure previously! with progressively more overidentifying restric- tions ~i+e+, larger 6c 6 2 6b 6; therefore the name “upward testing”! until we find that all tests with the same value of 6c 6 2 6b 6 reject the null hypothesis that the moment conditions considered are all correct+ Let ZkUT denote the largest value such that for all k # ZkUT , there is at least one ~b, c! [ BC with 6c 6 2 6b 6 5 k for which the null hypothesis is not rejected+ Given ZkUT , we take the upward 930 HAN HONG ET AL. testing estimator ~ ZbUT , [cUT ! to be the vector that minimizes GELn~b, c! over ~b, c!

Analogy with Parametric Likelihood Model Selection Procedure Andrews ~1999! shows that the J-statistic-based MSC is analogous to standard MSC ~such as the BIC, Akaike information criterion @AIC#, and HQIC! often employed in parametric model selection procedures+ When we use GEL to for- mulate the MSC, this analogy is very transparent because, in this case, an ex- plicit likelihood- ~or information-! based rationale also underlies the moment selection procedure, just as in the fully parametric case+ Andrews ~1999! notes that his J-statistic MSC is analogous to the parametric MSC in the sense that, among correct models, this criterion would choose the more tightly specified model+ Equation ~6+6! in Andrews ~1999! shows an equivalence result between the problem of maximizing the number of moment conditions ~i+e+, minimizing the number of excluded moment conditions! and minimizing the number of parameters, among correctly specified models+ In this section, we show an analogous equivalence for GEL-based MSCs+ Under correct specification GEL is asymptotically equivalent to GMM esti- mation using the optimal weighting matrix+ The use of GEL-based MSC also provides a transparent proof of this equivalence result by avoiding the issues associated with choosing the optimal weighting matrix in GMM estimation, which arise when considering the J-statistic+ Following Andrews ~1999!, we simplify notation by assuming that all the models under consideration are correctly specified, and we focus on the mo- ment selection problem ~involving the moment selection vector c and the asso- ciated Lagrange multipliers tc!+ Therefore, in the discussion that follows, we EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD MODEL SELECTION 931 let b [ :1, the vector whose elements are all 1, and gb 5 g throughout, and we assume that gc~{! is sufficient for identification of g+ Our goal is to show the equivalence between GEL1n 5 2 min g max tc F( t51 n r~tc 'gc~Xt ;g!!G, (3) where gc~{! is the subvector of g~{! selected by c, and GEL2n 5 2 min g,m max tc ,t2c F( t51 n r~tc 'gc~Xt ;g! 1 t2c' ~g2c~Xt ;g! 2 m!!G, (4) where g2c~{! is the subvector of the totality of moment conditions g~{! that are excluded by the selection vector c+ Here m is of dimension r 2 6c 6, where r is the total number of moment conditions under consideration+ This equivalence is analogous to equation ~6+6! in Andrews ~1999! and implies that the moment selection problem can alternatively be viewed as a model ~i+e+, parameter! se- lection problem, with the augmented parameter vector ~g,m!' + The equivalence of ~3! and ~4! is easy to demonstrate; indeed, let ~ Jg, Itc! solve ~3!, i+e+, satisfy the first-order conditions 2 ( t51 n gc~Xt ; Jg! ,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!! 5 0, 2 ( t51 n Itc' ]gc~Xt ; Jg! ]g ,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!! 5 0+ Then it follows that ~g 5 Jg,tc 5 Itc,t2c 5 0! and m 5 S( t51 n g2c~Xt ; Jg!,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!!DYS( t51 n ,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!!D solves the problem in ~4!+ Indeed, one can easily verify that the first-order con- ditions for problem ~4!, which can be written as ] ]tc GEL2n 5 2 ( t51 n gc~Xt ; Jg!,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!! 5 0, ] ]g GEL2n 5 2 ( t51 n Itc' ]gc~Xt ; Jg! ]g ,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!! 5 0, ] ]t2c GEL2n 5 2 ( t51 n ~g2c~Xt ; Tg! 2 m!,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!! 5 0, ] ]m GEL2n 5 2t2c ( t51 n ,r~ Itc'gc~Xt ; Jg!! 5 0, 932 HAN HONG ET AL. are necessarily satisfied at these parameter values+ It is also immediately obvi- ous that at these parameter values the two GEL functions are identical: GEL1n~ Jg, Itc ! 5 GEL2n~ Jg,m, Itc ,0!, which is analogous to equation ~6! in Andrews ~1999!+ Thus the analogy be- tween generalized empirical likelihood-based moment and model selection procedures and Andrews’ J-statistic based procedures is complete+ The use of GEL-based MSC allows us to generalize the likelihood-based rationale under- lying the usual MSC for parametric models to semiparametric models in which the data-generating process is only partially specified via population moment restrictions+ 3. MONTE CARLO EXPERIMENTS In this section we report the results from a simple Monte Carlo study designed to compare MSC based on the J-statistic as proposed by Andrews ~1999! and Andrews and Lu ~2001! and also on two special cases of the GEL statistic: em- pirical likelihood and exponential tilting+ Formally, these criteria are written as MSCJn~b, c!

as the identity mapping and sequence of constants as kn 5 Mn , which we refer to as root n information criterion ~RNIC!+ The model is specified by the set of equations yt 5 1 1 xt 1 0+5ut ~1 1 a6zt 6!, xt 5 ht 1 0+5ut , zt 5 ht 1 0+5ft , ft 5 ht 1 0+3ut , where ut , ht , and ft are all independently distributed N~0,1! random variables, truncated at 22 and 2+ Both zt and ft are candidate instruments+ By considering alternative values for the coefficient a the analysis can accommodate homoske- dastic and heteroskedastic error structures+ To this end, values of zero and a small positive constant are considered+ The fact that E @ ft ut # Þ 0 implies that EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD MODEL SELECTION 933 moment conditions constructed from the instrument ft are invalid+ Moment con- ditions are constructed from the following five possible instrument groups+ M1+ constant, cos~z!

estimator is known to be the same as if ~b0, c0! are picked a priori ~see, e+g+, Pötscher, 1991!+ In the subsequent tables, these three groupings of instruments will be refer- enced by the abbreviations OC, Truth, and IC, respectively+ The sin~{! and cos~{! functions are utilized as a convenient way to generate instruments+ Following the suggestions in Andrews and Lu ~2001!, we have chosen the moment condi- tions in these models so that ~i! there is a noticeable difference in efficiency between the estimators that use all the correct moment conditions and the esti- mators that use only those moment conditions that are known to be correct and ~ii! there are noticeable biases in the estimators that use incorrect moment con- ditions+ This setup allows for gains to be exploited from a good moment selec- tion procedure+ It is clear that the exercise can be generalized to allow also for “model selection” over sets of possible regressors+ Following Andrews and Lu ~2001!, we assess the relative performance of these MSC by comparing the probability with which the three MSCs select the true ~b0, c0!; other consistent ~b, c!; and inconsistent ~b, c!+ MSC that have both a high probability of selecting the true model and a low probability of selecting inconsistent models are preferred+ The performance of postselection estimators is assessed by comparison of the bias and root mean squared errors ~RMSEs! of the estimated slope coefficient of each model+ The rejection rates for a 5% t-test that each of these parameter estimates is equal to the true value of unity are also computed+ These statistics are reported for estimation based on each of the five instrument sets and for each of the four MSC, to give a total of nine postselection model results+ Because there are three estimation methods— GMM, EL, and ET—we report postselection results for a total of 27 models+ Results based on the proposed EL- and ET-based MSC relative to the GMM- based approach are of most interest+ The results based on each of the five pos- 934 HAN HONG ET AL. sible instrument groups are presented for comparison, with the infeasible estimator resulting from the use of M2 giving the “ideal” benchmark+ The re- sults are based on 500 repetitions for four sample sizes, N 5 50, 250, 500, and 1,000+ Table 1 details the probabilities of selecting the true, other consistent, and inconsistent models under assumption of a homoskedastic error structure ~a 5 0!+ For each estimation method, results are collected by each of the four proposed penalty functions ~BIC, AIC, HQIC, and RNIC!+ Considering the BIC and MN criteria, it is clear that the J-MSC outperforms both the MSCEL and MSCET for the smaller sample sizes+ The probability of selecting the true model is higher by 5% and the probability of selecting a misspecified model lower by up to 10%+ As the sample size increases the discrepancy between the J-MSC and MSCET vanishes, whereas the MSCEL has slightly higher probability of selecting an inconsistent model+ Under the AIC criterion, the MSCET outperforms both J-MSC and MSCEL at all sample sizes+ The gains are of the order of 10%, though they are somewhat smaller when compared to MSCEL at larger sample Table 1.

Finally, Table 3 presents an identical set of results to those in Table 2 but for the sample sizes N 5 500 and 1,000+ Consistent with the results of Table 1, as N increases from 250 to 1,000 the bias is essentially eliminated for GMM- and ET-based models and the RMSEs fall at a rate consistent with the increase in sample size+ For both larger sample sizes the ET-based results are marginally better than the GMM-based results, whereas the EL-based results are some- what worse+ For ET and GMM the BIC, HQIC, and RNIC MSC nearly always Table 2.

CONCLUSIONS This paper, following Andrews ~1999! and Andrews and Lu ~2001!, proposes GEL-based MSC for unconditional moment-based models+ The MSC seek to minimize the GEL-statistic modified by a penalty function that rewards use of additional correct moment conditions for a given number of parameters and penalizes less tightly specified models for a given number of moment conditions+ The GEL-based criteria have an information-theoretic interpretation even if all models are incorrectly specified+ If there is at least one model that is cor- rectly specified then the GEL-MSC chooses the most parsimoniously specified model among correctly specified models with probability converging to 1+ If all models are misspecified, the proposed MSC choose the model that mini- mizes the penalty-augmented GEL-statistic+ Thus, in the case of EL, the con- sistent MSC chooses the model that is closest to the population density in KLIC distance and also the most parsimonious in the number of parameters+3 The usefulness of the GEL-based MSC was considered in a simple Monte Carlo study for two special cases of GEL: empirical likelihood and exponential tilting+ Whereas in small sample sizes, J-MSC performed well relative to the EL- and ET-based MSC for a range of postselection statistics, in larger samples the ET-based MSC performed marginally better than the J-MSC, with some improvements over the EL-based MSC+ Although these results are specific to the example we studied, they suggest that GEL-based MSC can be a useful alternative to J-MSC+ NOTES 1+ For detailed definitions see Andrews and Lu ~2001!+ We closely follow their notation+ 2+ For random sampling data typically GELn~b, c!, as defined in ~1!, converges in distribution to x6c 626b 62 under correct specification, although for consistent model selection we only need GELn- ~b, c! 5 Op~1!+ 3+ Using GEL to form MSC also has the advantage of not having to choose a weighting matrix+ Another benefit is that GEL criterion functions remain invariant to certain normalizations of mo- ment conditions+ We thank a referee for raising this point with us+ REFERENCES Ahn, H+, Y+ Kitamura, & G+ Tripathi ~2001!

Existence of ~gb*,tc*! in condition ~2! of Assumption 2 is en- sured by the continuity of Er~tc~gb!'g~Xt ,gb!! and the compactness of the parameter space+ First consider condition ~3! of Assumption 2+ Define [tc~gb ! 5 argmaxtc[Lc Qn~gb ,tc !+ Using all three conditions, standard arguments as in Amemiya ~1985! and Newey and McFadden ~1994! adjusted for the dependence of the objective function on gb can be used to show that supgb[Gb 6 [tc~gb ! 2 tc~gb!6 5 op~1!+ Therefore by the definition that [gb 5 argmingb[Gb Qn~ [tc~gb !,gb !, to show [gb 2 gb 5 op~1!, it suffices to show that sup gb[Gb 6Qn~ [tc~gb !,gb ! 2 Er~tc~gb !'gc~Xt ,gb !!6 5 op~1!+ 940 HAN HONG ET AL. This can be split into two parts+ The first part is sup gb[Gb 6Qn~ [tc~gb !,gb ! 2 Er~ [tc~gb !'gc~Xt ,gb !!6 5 op~1!, and the second part is supgb[Gb 6Er~ [tc~gb !

The arguments follow those in Kitamura and Stutzer ~1997!, Christoffersen et al+ ~2001!, Chernozhukov and Hansen ~2001!, and Newey and Smith ~2000!+ We summarize the key steps here+ First define [tc* 5 argmaxtc[Lc (t51 n r~tc 'gc~Xt ;gb*!!+ Using conditions ~ N1! and ~ N2! to Taylor-expand the first-order condition 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ;gb*!,r~ [tc* ' gc~Xt ;gb*!! 5 0 around tc 5 0, we obtain that 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ;gb*! 1 Vc~gb*!Mn [tc* 1 op~Mn [tc*! n Mn [tc* 5 Vc~gb*!21 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ;gb*! 1 op~1! 5 Op~1!, where the last equality follows from conditions ~ N2! and ~ N3!+ Then a quadratic expansion shows ( t51 n r~ [tc* ' gc~Xt ;gb*!! 5 Mn [tc* 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ;gb*! 1 ~Mn [tc*!'Vc~gb*!~Mn [tc*! 1 op~n [tc*2! 5 Op~1!+ EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD MODEL SELECTION 941 Then, for arbitrary h, Op~1! 5 ( t51 n r~ [tc* ' gc~Xt ,gb*!! $ ( t51 n rS hMn gc~Xt , [gb !D 5 h Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ; [gb ! 1 h 'Vc~gb*!h 1 op~h 2 !, which implies 10Mn (t51n gc~Xt ; [gb ! 5 Op~1!+ Next, Taylor-expand the first-order con- dition for [tc: 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ; [gb !,r~ [tc'gc~Xt ; [gb !! 5 0 to obtain that 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ; [gb ! 1 Vc~gb*!Mn [tc 1 op~Mn [tc ! n Mn [tc 5 Vc~gb*!21 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt ; [gb ! 1 op~1! 5 Op~1!+ Finally, using 10Mn (t51n gc~Xt ; [gb ! 5 Op~1! and Mn [tc 5 Op~1! in a Taylor expansion, we obtain ( t51 n r~ [tc'gc~Xt ; [gb !! 5 1 Mn (t51 n gc~Xt , [gb !Mn [tc 1Mn [tc'Vc~gb*! 5 Op~1!+ As noted in Newey and Smith ~2000!, the preceding result does not require the com- plete set of conditions for Mn -consistency and asymptotic normality of [gb+ The condi- tions of the lemma can potentially be modified to allow for the cases when gb* is not uniquely identified+ n Proof of Proposition 1. The proof is very similar to Andrews and Lu ~2001!+ Be- cause by Assumption 2 condition ~1! the domain of Lc includes 0 as an interior point, by the saddle point definition of ~gb*,tc*!, for each ~b, c!
