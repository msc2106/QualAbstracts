ABSTRACT: 
This contribution to the ‘Britain Votes 2017’ special issue of Parliamentary Affairs focuses on the Conservative Party’s campaign. It was a campaign at which everything that could go wrong for the Conservatives did go wrong. The manifesto, which May’s Chief of Staff Nick Timothy believed would be an asset, turned into a liability, confirming the belief of her campaign consultant Lynton Crosby that the contest between the parties needed to be framed in terms of leadership. Unfortunately, however, Theresa May simply wasn’t the kind of presidential politician who could carry that kind of campaign. Nor did Brexit do her or her party as much of a favour as everyone had expected. For one thing, she seemed to think she could get away with mouthing mantras and platitudes about leaving the EU, opening up a vacuum that other issues rushed in to fill. For another, the number of UKIP, older, poorly-educated and working-class voters that the party gained as a result of the government’s tough talk on Europe seems to have been outweighed by the number of younger, better-educated, middle-class, Remain voters who were alienated and infuriated by it. More generally, the Tories suffered because they were unable or unwilling, ideologically or otherwise, to respond convincingly to increasing voter concern about ongoing cuts to key public services.

FULL TEXT: 
 TIM BALE AND PAUL WEBB*‘We Didn’t See it Coming’:1The ConservativesTheresa May’s decision to call an early election was clearly a foolish one—butonly in hindsight. After all, opinion polls had been showing the Conservativesway ahead of Labour for months and they had not long before chalked up thefirst by-election gain from the opposition by a governing party for thirty-fiveyears. Moreover, on almost every leadership measure one cared to mention,Mrs May was beating Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hands down. And if anyonehad counselled her to wait for the results of local election results beforedeciding, they could easily have been accused of looking unduly cautious: inthe event, in England and Wales the Conservatives gained nearly 400 seats,Labour lost nearly 250 and UKIP over 140, while the much-anticipated LiberalDemocrat revival came to nothing; north of the border, Labour and the SNPboth lost support, allowing the Conservatives to claim second place. Hardlysurprising, then, that all the talk was not of whether May would win but byhow many seats, and what would that mean both for Brexit and the future ofthe Labour Party.1. A personalised campaign with no personalityBut behind the scenes at Conservative Central Office (CCHQ), apparently, noteverything was tickety-boo. Well-sourced accounts (albeit conflicting ones) ofthe Conservative campaign suggest that it was, in fact, plagued with problemsfrom the start (Shipman, 2017, McTague et al., 2017). Overseas consultantsLynton Crosby, Mark Textor, and Jim Messina had, along with CCHQ veteranStephen Gilbert, agreed to get the band back together in order to repeat their2015 success. But not all of them were convinced that their new lead singer wasentirely wise to have called the election in the first place (Walters, 2017).*Tim Bale, School of Politics and International Relations, Queen Mary University of London,t.bale@qmul.ac.uk; Paul Webb, Department of Politics, University of Sussex, p.webb@sussex.ac.uk1Theresa May, interviewed by Emma Barnett, BBC Radio 5 Live, 13 June 2017.# The Author(s) 2018.

For their part (see Timothy, 2017) May’s advisors were apparentlyunhappy at the way their boss was thrust front and centre of what, even in an era ofpersonalized politics, started out as an exceptionally presidential campaign—onewhich, realising that voters were beginning to worry about the impact of continuedausterity on key public services, aimed to capitalize on the fact that the PM wasmore popular than not only the leader of the opposition but her own party, too.As a result, the party’s direct mail and leaflets played down Tory candidates’Conservative Party affiliation in favour of associating them with the ‘strong andstable’ prime minister. But, May—by all accounts something of an introvert—was incapable of, or at least uncomfortable with, getting out there and convinc-ingly selling herself. So, rather than being forced to meet ordinary voters, she wasinstead smuggled into all-ticket events in soulless out-of-town warehouses filled(if that’s really the right word) with her own party activists gathered together atshort notice for yet another unconvincing photo op. And even those rallies weretoo often held in constituencies that Labour held on to rather than in thosewhich, in hindsight, the Tories should have been ensuring really were as safe asthey, in their hubris, believed. Neither the optics nor the itinerary, in other words,did the PM or her party any favours.Nor, in all probability, did May’s reluctance to take part in the kind of televiseddebates that had enlivened the elections of 2010 and (to a lesser extent) 2015. Thatreluctance was understandable—a format that requires a politician to think ontheir feet and at least pretend to answer questions from ‘real people’ was unlikelyto suit her (see Prince, 2017). And as the incumbent with a record to defend, aswell as the apparent front-runner, May probably had more to lose than to gainfrom appearing. But when Labour suddenly announced that Jeremy Corbyn haddecided, after all, to take part in the big, televised leaders’ debate on 31 May, thePM’s refusal to do the same made her look scared of getting into the ring withhim—and she looked even worse, perhaps, when it was revealed that HomeSecretary, Amber Rudd, who deputised for her, had agreed to do so just days afterthe death of her father. May’s no-show also re-doubled what by then was alreadywidespread criticism of a Conservative campaign clearly desperate to protect thewoman who journalists had cruelly dubbed ‘the Maybot’ from contact with mem-bers of the public—in marked contrast to Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, who was con-stantly pictured speaking spontaneously and authentically to ecstatic crowds.Yet when May did come into contact with ‘real people’, albeit in a televisionstudio, it was immediately apparent why her minders had been so worried aboutthe possibility. It might not have been a complete coincidence that things reallybegan to slip away from the Conservatives after her appearance in front of a livestudio audience less than a week from polling day, when, rather patronisingly’We Didn’t See it Coming’: The Conservatives 47Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 2018perhaps, she told a nurse complaining about her pay that ‘there isn’t a magicmoney tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that peoplewant.’ YouGov’s Political Tracker poll showed the Prime Minister’s net approvalrating dropping from þ18 on 11 May toþ 9 on 25 May and to -5 by 1 June.Wheeling out Boris Johnson, which some at CCHQ were now suggesting in thehope that he could inject a bit of life into the Conservative campaign, could havedone nothing to arrest that slide. Indeed, the contrast between his shamblingstar-quality and her charisma by-pass would only have made things worse.2. Underlying organizational and operational shortcomingsEven if Mrs May’s own performance hadn’t left so much to be desired, theConservatives would still have had to cope with some long-term structural prob-lems (see Beckett, 2017). The most obvious of these was that the party had (andstill has) fewer members (circa 150,000 according to the most recent availableestimate) and therefore almost certainly fewer activists, than its Labour rival(517,000 going into the election). Two years previously, the Tories got aroundthis problem by organising Team 2015 and bussing bunches of activists on ‘roadtrips’ to campaign in marginal constituencies. However, they dared not repeatthe trick this time around after the resulting row over the allocation of costsbetween national and constituency campaign expenses got them into consider-able trouble (Electoral Commission, 2017). As a result, the Conservatives’‘ground game’ almost certainly suffered in comparison to Labour’s.Moreover, the Conservative ground game was further hobbled by CCHQ appa-rently insisting that the few volunteers local associations were able to mustershould focus their voter contact effort on lists of likely supporters conjured frombig data compiled at the centre rather than from locally-led canvassing—a deci-sion which, according to many activists, led them to the homes of people whowould never have voted Tory in a million years. Things weren’t made any bettereither when, as those activists began to report back that some of theConservatives’ target seats looked less than winnable, there was little or no effortmade to divert them back to defending seats that suddenly looked to be in danger.These issues only served to fuel a degree of distrust between many local associ-ations and Conservative Campaign Headquarters that had already been sparkedby the way the latter (perhaps inevitably given the fact that May’s suddenannouncement of an election left it only a couple of weeks to get things sorted)had short-circuited candidate selection procedures (Wallace, 2017). In constitu-encies where incumbent Tory MPs were stepping down, and in target seats,CCHQ was permitted to oblige local associations to choose from shortlists (someof them very short indeed) that it had put together without consultation, and innon-target seats it was allowed simply to impose a candidate—indeed, in48 Britain Votes 2017Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 2018Scotland (with one or two exceptions) the latter was the norm. Attempts by asso-ciations to push back against such efforts proved fruitless in most cases, servingonly to strain relations even further. Moreover, a number of would-be candidates(many of them activists) found themselves left out in the cold by an opaque andsometimes chaotic vetting system that had insufficient time to properly considerapplicants’ campaign records and, some complained, was designed to allow peo-ple favoured by ‘the higher-ups’ to get the official approval required to be placedon shortlists or imposed on associations. All in all, the process left a bad taste inthe mouth of many grassroots members and did nothing to help morale—notgood when the party was short of members in the first place and badly neededthose it did have to enter the fray with enthusiasm.The damage done to the morale of the Tory grassroots may go some way toexplaining the relative decline in their campaign activity during the election.Table 3.1 reveals that across a range of nine different activities about which theESRC-funded Party Members Project asked party members during the electioncampaigns of 2015 and 2017, the percentages of Conservative members claimingto have done them dropped in every case. While this was also true of Labour’smembers in a number of cases, it was not so for all activities, and never by asmuch. The Tories suffered particularly notable drops in the proportion of mem-bers reporting having delivered leaflets, attended hustings and canvassed—thelast of these being of obvious importance for mobilizing electoral support at con-stituency level. The mean change in the Conservative column of Table 3.1 is -7.2,compared to just -1.7 for Labour—and Labour, of course, had four times asmany members in the first place. When it came to grassroots campaign activity,then, the governing party was probably way behind the opposition.Table 3.1 Campaign activities of Conservative and Labour Party members, 2015-2017% saying they did the following: Conservative(N51002)Labour(N51024)Displayed election poster in window 21.6 (-8.0) 55.4 (þ4.2)Delivered leaflets 30.5 (-13.0) 31.6 (-10.9)Attended public meeting or hustings 19.8 (-11.5) 24.9 (-6.5)Canvassed face to face or by phone 21.3 (-15.2) 27.1 (-8.6)‘Liked’ something by party/candidate on FB 39.3 (-0.3) 63.4 (þ12.3)Tweeted/re-tweeted party/candidate messages 24.2 (-1.8) 38.5 (þ1.6)Helped run party committee 7.0 (-5.0) 4.1 (-4.3)Drove voters to polling stations 2.3 (-4.1) 4.8 (-2.4)Other 10.2 (-6.1) 13.6 (-0.6)None 24.7 (þ1.7) 9.3 (-3.6)Note: All figures are percentages.

But even they noticed very early on that they were beingoutgunned online—not least because CCHQ seemed to think that its paid-forads on Facebook and YouTube videos would be able to compete with the torrentof rather edgier, savvier and far more share-worthy content and memes beingproduced by Labour, Momentum, and by their supporters on a do-it-yourself,‘organic’ basis. Again, Table 3.1 offers clear evidence that Labour’s members werefar more politically engaged with social media than their Tory counterparts dur-ing the campaign. Moreover, while Labour already enjoyed a head-start over itsmajor party rival at the outset of the campaign, evidence suggests that it furtherbenefited from a 61% increase in the numbers of their ‘followers’ on social mediaduring the six weeks of the election campaign, compared with a six per cent risefor the Tories (Morgan, 2017). Thus, the digital reach of the Labour Party seemsto have been significantly greater than that of the Conservatives.3. Self-inﬂicted woundsBut problems with the operational, organizational and digital aspects of theConservative campaign cannot disguise, and were not responsible for, its short-term tactical failures. One of the earliest (and least commented on in theso-called ‘Mainstream Media’, though not on Facebook and Twitter) was a com-mitment to a free vote in Parliament on the reintroduction of fox-hunting—anactivity opposed by over three-quarters of the public. May’s support for the idea(according to the many Conservative activists who detected it damaging theircause on the doorstep) badly undermined the attempt made by the party sinceshe took over as Prime Minister in July 2016 to argue that she wasn’t one of those‘same old Tories’ (Lowe, 2017).The pledge on fox hunting, however, was just one item among many in alargely uncosted and pessimistic Tory manifesto which might have been expresslydesigned to re-toxify rather than de-toxify the party (Maltby, 2017) and to putoff rather than pull in voters. Special mention, however, should go to those poli-cies impacting on the elderly—a group whose support the Tories could (and per-haps at this election did) take for granted. Believing they would win the electionand therefore be back in government, and realising that they needed more roomfor manoeuvre on the fiscal front, the Conservatives refused to give an open-ended commitment to continuing the so-called ‘Triple Lock’ on pensions intro-duced by David Cameron and George Osborne or the winter-fuel paymentsbrought in before 2010.50 Britain Votes 2017Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 2018Even more damaging, however, at least according to both opinion polls andanecdotal evidence, was the proposal that the value of an individual’s house (overand above £100,000) should be included in the calculation of assets used to deter-mine their contribution to the bill for their social care—a suggestion swiftly andvery effectively branded ‘the dementia tax’ by opponents and the media. Thischorus of criticism precipitated a screeching U-turn by Mrs May, who then man-aged to make matters even worse for herself by insisting, to the incredulity ofeveryone watching, that ‘nothing has changed’. Turning out to be ‘weak and wob-bly’ rather than ‘strong and stable’ was bad enough; treating voters like idiotsturned out to be calamitous.4. Longer-term problems: austerity and insecurityBut it was as much about what was not in the manifesto as about what was in itthat got the Tories into trouble. Irritation with May’s tin-eared, ‘magic moneytree’ riposte to the nurse who had asked her on live television about pay tappedinto wider concern on the part of voters—including some who nevertheless wenton to vote Conservative if post-election polling is anything to go by—that keypublic services (and the people who work in them) were coming under seriousfinancial strain as the result of the austerity policies pursued by the governmentsince 2010. Lived experience remains crucial to the way people vote, and no-onewith school-aged children or anyone who had needed to use the NHS could havefailed to notice that, however much ministers repeated the mantra that spendingon both was at record levels, education and healthcare were running desperatelyshort of resources. At least some of those voters would also have noticed thatthose same ministers, after years of telling the public that savings must be madein order to balance the books, had not only manifestly failed to achieve that goalbut now seemed surprisingly relaxed about extending the timeframe to meet it inorder to accommodate any negative economic effects brought about by Brexit—ahistoric change which, voters had been told during the referendum campaign,would mean an extra £350 million a week for the NHS. Nearly a year later, it wasobvious that any such windfall would be a long time coming, if it ever came at all.It was also obvious by then that talk of Mrs May being a new kind ofConservative—talk which seemed to rest on little more than a couple of speechespenned for her by Nick Timothy before she entered Number Ten as PrimeMinister—looked wide of the mark. There was certainly precious little sign in theTory manifesto of much being done either directly or indirectly for the so-called‘Just About Managing’, or the public services they relied on, and all this at a timewhen growth was slow and when even those fortunate enough to get a pay risewere increasingly finding that any gains made were quickly offset by prices drivenup by the fall in sterling precipitated by the referendum result (see Corlett et al.,’We Didn’t See it Coming’: The Conservatives 51Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 20182017). After the election, some Tories wondered why their party hadn’t talkedmore about the economy: they should have realised that there was a reason forthat.Perhaps if the Conservatives had been facing a Labour Party believingthat it was on the verge of getting into government and therefore as des-perate as it had been in 2015 to (i) prove that it was fiscally responsibleand (ii) avoid giving any hostages to fortune, none of this would haveproved quite so problematic. Unfortunately, however, Labour under JeremyCorbyn had few expectations of winning the election and was anyway moreideologically inclined to oppose austerity. As a result, it was prepared tomake a positive, optimistic and even idealistic (though some would sayunrealistic) offer to the electorate involving an end to pay restraint in thepublic sector as well as big increases in spending on key services—all paidfor by tax rises that would supposedly hit only big business and the rich.Corbyn was also confident enough, after a second terrorist attack duringthe campaign looked like it might hand an advantage to the PrimeMinister, to counter the accusation that, as an apparent supporter of anynumber of paramilitary organizations around the world, he was ‘soft-on-ter-rorism’. The Labour leader responded with a claim that she, as HomeSecretary, had cut police numbers in order to save money and balance thebooks. The score-draw that resulted from the charge and counter-chargemay have been unseemly—Corbyn supporters were particularly irritated bya Tory Facebook advertisement on the issue which achieved 6.6 millionviews—but the fact that the terrorism issue was not an easy victory for theConservatives was in effect a win for Labour.The intense media discussion of both the terrorist attacks and the parties’manifestos also dovetailed with a natural (and some would say entirely proper)desire on the part of journalists during elections, first, to avoid slavishly followingthe agenda set by politicians and, second, to discuss the policies being presentedto the electorate. This proved problematic for a Conservative campaign that hadhoped to keep the focus away from policy and instead on who would be best ableto negotiate Brexit. As a result—and also as a result of Jeremy Corbyn’s better-than-expected media performances and Labour’s more-popular-than-expectedmanifesto—the Conservatives did not enjoy the kind of effortless superiority inbroadcast and print coverage that they had anticipated (Deacon and Smith,2017). Given the fact that they anticipated (quite rightly it turns out) no suchsuperiority when it came to social media, which is clearly becoming an increas-ingly important part of the mix, this must have come as quite a blow (see Bond,2017). The media, mainstream or social, doesn’t have as big an impact on electionoutcomes as some imagine (see Newton, 2006) but it’s always nice to have itfirmly on one’s side.52 Britain Votes 2017Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 20185. Winners and LosersWe need, however, not to get so carried away by the contrast between what manythought would happen to a Corbyn-led Labour Party and what actually happened(as well as between the smart campaign we expected from the Conservatives andthe maladroit one they actually delivered) that we forget the fact that the Toriesgarnered their biggest share of the vote since 1983. Nor should we ignore theirmuch improved performance in Scotland, where the popularity of RuthDavidson, the Tory leader there, undoubtedly contributed to the party virtuallydoubling its share of the vote to 28.6% and boosting its share of Westminsterseats from just one to 13. It is also worth noting that, according to a number oflarge-sample post-election polls (principally those conducted by Lord Ashcroft,YouGov and Ipsos MORI), the Conservatives made big gains in Great Britain as awhole among working-class voters, particularly in the private sector, registeringgains of over ten percentage points among not just semi- and unskilled workersbut also among the C2 voters fabled for swinging elections one way or another(see Table 3.2). Polling and constituency breakdowns suggest that a large part ofthat gain derived from Mrs May’s much-trumpeted determination to ‘take backcontrol’ of Britain’s borders by ensuring that ‘Brexit means Brexit’—hence the sixseats gained from Labour in the wake of their recording big majorities for Leavein the 2016 referendum: Copeland, Derbyshire North East, Mansfield,Middlesboro South, Stoke South and Walsall North. More generally, theConservatives recorded a higher share of the vote in 2017 than they had in 2015in areas of the country that voted to leave in the referendum.Those gains were very much of a piece with the strategy followed by TheresaMay since becoming Prime Minister, namely to hoover up voters who might oth-erwise have supported UKIP by offering them not just a hard Brexit and furtheraction on immigration but also signature policies like a return to grammarschools. And, on the surface anyway, the strategy looked like a roaring success.UKIP, now without its iconic leader, Nigel Farage, dropped further and furtherdown in the opinion polls and at the election fell from 12.6% of the vote in 2015to just 1.8%. Analysis of post-election polling, however, suggests that a significantnumber of erstwhile UKIP supporters, reassured by a combination ofConservative rhetoric and Corbyn’s promise to respect the result of the referen-dum, felt no obligation to vote Tory, especially when they and those aroundthem probably had more to gain materially from Labour’s left-wing pitch thanthey did from continued austerity under Mrs May and her colleagues.Meanwhile, analysis of constituency voting reveals, possibly rather surprisingly,that in those seats where UKIP decided not to stand a candidate (perhaps in orderto give a Brexit-supporting Tory a clear run, perhaps simply to save money),Labour rather than the Conservatives tended to be the main beneficiary. As a’We Didn’t See it Coming’: The Conservatives 53Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 2018result, and because Labour often had reasonably-sized majorities anyway in many‘Leave’ constituencies, the improvement in the Conservatives’ vote share in thoseplaces was insufficient to deliver them anywhere near the number of seats theyhad been hoping for.Moreover, the flip side of the Conservatives’ efforts to attract working-class‘authoritarian’ and anti-immigration/anti-European voters was the backlash theyTable 3.2 The demographics of voting, 2017Conservative Labour Lib Dem Turnout(registeredvoters)Labour toConservativeSwingAll 44 (þ6) 41 (þ10) 8 (0) 69 (þ3) 2GenderMale 44 (þ6) 40þ11 7 (-1) 67 (þ2) 2.5Female 43 (þ6) 42 (þ9) 8 (0) 69 (þ3) 1.5Age18-24 27 (-1) 62 (þ20) 5 (þ1) 64 (þ21) 10.525-34 27 (-6) 56 (þ20) 9 (þ2) 64 (þ10) 1335-44 33 (-2) 49 (þ14) 10 (0) 63 (-1) 845-54 43 (þ7) 40 (þ8) 7 (-1) 72 (0) 0.555-64 51 (þ14) 34 (þ3) 7 (-2) 73 (-4) þ5.565þ 61 (þ14) 25 (þ3) 7 (-1) 73 (-5) þ5.5Social ClassAB 47 (þ2) 37 (þ11) 10 (-2) 73 (-2) 4.5C1 44 (þ2) 40 (þ12) 7 (-1) 74 (þ6) 5C2 45 (þ13) 41 (þ9) 6 (0) 66 (þ4) þ2DE 38 (þ12) 47 (þ6) 5 (0) 61 (þ5) þ3Housing TenureOwned 55 (þ9) 30 (þ7) 7 (-2) 73 (-4) þ1Mortgage 43 (þ4) 40 (þ8) 9 (0) 72 (þ3) 2Social renter 26 (þ8) 57 (þ8) 4 (þ1) 60 (þ4) 0Private renter 31 (þ3) 54 (þ15) 7 (þ1) 65 (þ14) 6Ethnic groupWhite 45 (þ6) 39 (þ11) 8 (0) 69 (þ1) 2.5All BME 19 (-4) 73 (þ8) 6 (þ2) 64 (-6) 6EducationNo qualifications 52 35 4 64Other qualifications 46 39 6 67Degree or higher 33 48 12 76EU Ref voteRemain 33 47 13 78Leave 46 39 7 69Did not vote 23 66 4 25Source: Adapted from ‘How Britain Voted 2017’, Ipsos MORI estimates , accessed at https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-2017-election?language_content_entity¼en-uk.

As a result, many Labour MPs who thought earlier that they werefacing almost certain defeat ended up with much bigger majorities (Rupa Huq inEaling Central and Acton who won by just 274 votes in 2015 but by 13,807 in2017 being perhaps the most striking example) while others who thought theyhad little chance of snatching their seats from Tory incumbents managed to doso—Emma Dent Coad in Kensington springs immediately to mind. Meanwhile,the return to the Commons of the former Liberal Democrat minister VinceCable, in his old seat in Twickenham, at the expense of the Tory opponent whohad defeated him in 2015 was almost certainly down, at least in part, to theTories’ failure to replicate their increased appeal among white working-class vot-ers among their middle-class counterparts.Every bit as importantly, the Conservatives’ nationalistic and narrow-mindedthrust did them no favours with younger voters either. And ‘young’ doesn’t meanonly those 18-24 year olds (many of them students) who were so taken by JeremyCorbyn that they contributed to Tory defeats in university towns like previouslytrue-blue Canterbury. It also included (see Table 3.2) 25-44 year olds, a fair pro-portion of whom were struggling to get on the housing ladder in an era of risingprices, stagnant wages and limited construction, and some of whom were gettingletters home from their children’s schools asking them to contribute toward basiccosts or informing them of cuts to staffing.The Tories suffered an especially sharp swing to Labour among voters living inthe private rental sector, many of whom are increasingly despondent about theprospect of ever owning their own homes given the long-term crisis in housingthat has been slowly fomenting across the country. Whether or not the news that,in the wake of the dementia tax, they might not even stand to inherit much fromtheir parents came as the final straw, we may never know; but many of them wereclearly unimpressed by a Conservative manifesto and leadership that appeared tooffer not much more than Brexit and continuing austerity. Perhaps if Mrs Mayhad been able to offset such losses by boosting turnout among retirees, who con-tinued to vote Tory in much greater numbers, she might have triumphed. But,possibly due to her manifesto, the elderly voted less in 2015 than in 2017 (seeTable 3.2)—something that Lynton Crosby, speaking afterward, clearly consid-ered significant (Knaus, 2017).6. What is to be done?This was an election at which everything that could go wrong for theConservatives did go wrong. The manifesto, which May’s (now former) Chief’We Didn’t See it Coming’: The Conservatives 55Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 2018of Staff Nick Timothy believed would be an asset, turned into a liability, con-firming the belief of her campaign consultant Lynton Crosby that the contestbetween the parties needed to be framed in terms of leadership. Unfortunately,however, Theresa May simply wasn’t the kind of presidential politician whocould carry that kind of campaign. Nor did Brexit do her or her party as muchof a favour as everyone had expected. For one thing, she seemed to think shecould get away with mouthing mantras and platitudes about leaving the EU,opening up a vacuum that other issues rushed in to fill. For another, the num-ber of UKIP, older, poorly-educated and working-class voters that the partygained as a result of the government’s tough talk on Europe seems to havebeen outweighed by the number of younger, better-educated, middle-class,Remain voters who were alienated and infuriated by it—and by May’s claim ather party conference that ‘If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you area citizen of nowhere’ (Bush, 2017). More generally, the Tories suffered becausethey were unable or unwilling, ideologically or otherwise, to respondconvincingly—or even, to be honest, at all—to increasing voter concern aboutongoing cuts to key public services.Clearly, the Tories need to re-think a number of things in terms of strategyand organisation—something former Party Chairman, Eric Pickles, has sincereported back on Conservative Party (2017). How they do voter identificationand whether they have over-centralised their operation should clearly be key con-cerns, as should how they can better exploit truly local intelligence effectively. Itwill not be easy because any review worth the name is bound to bring into focusthe often fraught nature of the relationship between local associations and CCHQ(or Central Office, as it used to be known). Moreover, the Conservatives will haveto do all this at the same time as managing a precarious parliamentary situationwhile charged with the greatest challenge to confront a government in livingmemory: the successful negotiation of the United Kingdom’s exit from theEuropean Union. And the task will be made all the harder by the fact that theyare led by a Prime Minister who, in the wake of the election, has manifestly lostthe confidence of the British people and many of her own followers and col-leagues, despite having garnered an increased share of the vote across the country.The Conservative Party has a history of ruthlessly dispatching leaders once theyare perceived to have become electoral liabilities, so Theresa May’s time inDowning Street may be limited, even if, in the immediate aftermath of the elec-tion, there was little appetite in the party for replacing her, not least because therewas no agreement on who might best replace her (Savage, 2017). Whoever even-tually does so will be confronted with a huge political task if he or she is to con-struct a broad and winning electoral coalition better capable of turning votes inthe country into seats in parliament.56 Britain Votes 2017Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/71/suppl_1/46/4930853by Sussex Language Institute useron 05 April 2018AcknowledgementThis work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (grantnumber ES/M007537/1).
