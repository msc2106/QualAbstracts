ABSTRACT: 
This paper explores the possibility of defining a non-utilitarian normative standard for assessments of welfare and deprivation. The paper formalises a key aspect of Amartya Sen’s critique of the assumption of consistent utility-maximisation in the revealed preference theory and proposes a generalisation of the standard Samuelsonian choice model for the case in which choices are based on plural motives (here, self-interested and moral motives). Based on a set of intuitive assumptions about the way in which unobservable motives are linked to observable choices, we then construct an alternative normative ranking rule that can be used in non-utilitarian welfare economics to rank social outcomes or provide a normative basis for the construction of composite indices, for instance.

FULL TEXT: 
 in which unobservable motives are linked to observable choices, we then construct analternative normative ranking rule that can be used in non-utilitarianwelfare economicsto rank social outcomes or provide a normative basis for the construction of compositeindices, for instance.1 IntroductionSamuelsonian revealed preference theory (Samuelson 1938, 1948) provides the foun-dation formost contemporary economic analysis, positive and normative. Samuelson’stheory finds conditions on observed choices that are consistent with individual prefer-encemaximization. However, recent work in behavioural economics (see, for instance,B Sebastian Silva-Leandersebastian_silvaleander@yahoo.comSuman SethS.Seth@leeds.ac.uk1 Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, Department of International Development,University of Oxford, Oxford, UK2 Oxford Policy Management, 52 Cornmarket St, Oxford OX1 3HJ, UK3 Economics Division, Leeds University Business School, University of Leeds, Maurice KeyworthBuilding, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK123506 S. Silva-Leander, S. SethRubinstein and Salant 2012; Camerer et al. 2005) and evidence from neuroscience(Harrison 2008) have challenged the notion that individuals maximize a single well-defined preference in making choices. Sen has criticised the model from a normativepoint of view for arbitrarily attaching value to individuals’ actual choices, whateverthose may be, without regard for whether those choices are the product of an informedrational deliberation process, or whether they have been conditioned by ignorance,oppressive social structures, adaptation or even addiction (Sen 1977, 1980, 1997,2004).This paper seeks to contribute to the growing body of literature in economicsthat looks at the possibility and implications of reformulating Samuelson’s revealedpreference theory to respond to the above mentioned criticism (see, for instance,Kalai et al. 2002; Green and Hojman 2007). The model operates at two levels.First, choices are made at the individual level through an internal decision-makingmechanism based on underlying (unobservable) preference orderings, called motives.Individual choices are then combined into a social or collective choice througha collective (observable) decision making mechanism. Following Chambers andHayashi (2012), we will adopt the viewpoint of an external scientific observer oreconomist, who attempts to impute underlying binary preference relations (motives)from observed individual or collective choices over pairs of goods using a standardBayesian approach (see also Noor 2011, 2013). Advances in neurosciences may oneday enable us to obtain direct evidence on motivational sources (see, for instance,Bernheim and Rangel 2009). However, this paper will be concerned with the ques-tion of how to assign normative value to observed choices in the absence of suchevidence. The main result of the paper, captured in Proposition 2, is to show thatit is possible to generate a normative ranking of social outcomes that is based ona non-utilitarian description of human nature and thus on a non-standard theory ofchoice.The specific normative stance adopted in this paper follows Sen in consideringthat some motivations are more “legitimate” than others (e.g. rational deliberationvs. addiction), making it normatively relevant to aquire information, not only aboutobserved choices, but also about underlying motives.1 The proposed model is non-standard in that non-utilitarian motives are taken into account, but the methodologywe adopt for analysing those preferences is standard in that the observable is a choicecorrespondence, or collection of choice correspondences.In Sect. 2, we will introduce the notation and explain the overall structure of themodel. In Sect. 3, we present the model and introduce the axioms that will be used toderive the results. The standard (Samuelsonian)model is nested in ourmodel, whenweexclude reasoned or moral motives. In Sect. 4, we present our main results. Section 5concludes.1 In so doing we thus depart from the interpretation of the revealed preference theory as a methodologicalstatement (Gul and Pesendorfer 2005) and as a mere formalisation of the concept of preference as choice(Debreu 1954). For a critique of this interpretation and a justification of the chosen approach, we refer thereader to the writings of Sen (1977), Hirschman (1984) and Etzioni (1986).123Revealed preferences with plural motives: axiomatic… 5072 Structure and notationThe model works backwards from an external observer making inferences about theunderlyingmotives that have led individuals or groups of individuals to choose particu-lar options. The external observer thenmakes a normative rankingof the chosenoptionsbased on his/her positive assessment of the likely motives underpinning observedchoices.The notation used in this paper will be complicated by the fact that we use differentsymbols to describe the same object, depending on whether we are describing it fromthe point of view of the chooser or from the point of view of the external observer.This is deemed necessary to keep a clear distinction between normative, descriptiveand inferencial statements.Furthermore, the model comprises two levels of choice, namely an individual leveland a collective level, where individual choices are combined into social choices. Here,we will use different subscripts to distinguish these different levels, namely lower casesubscripts for individual choices, and upper case subscripts for collective choices.2.1 ChooserLet N be the set of all possible individuals and let X be the finite set of all possibleoptions. We denote any non-empty subset of X by S and the set of all such non-emptysubsets by K . If S is the set of options available to an individual i ∈ N , then letci (S) ⊆ S denote the choice set of i or the set of chosen options from S by i . Forexample, suppose S = {x, y} for any x, y ∈ X and ci (S) = {x}. This means thatindividual i has chosen option x from the available options x and y. Thus, ci (S) is theobservable primitive of the model. In this paper, we treat S as a variable within K asin Sen (1971).The observable choice set ci (S) has been generated from unobservable motives,R·i , through an internal decision making mechanism that is described below. Ourmodel however does not impose any functional form that represents these motives.The decision maker i’s motives are represented by a complete, transitive, and reflexivebinary relation over any pairs of options, x, y ∈ X , where x R·i y should be interpretedasmeaning that “x is at least as good as y according to themotive R·i .” The asymmetricand symmetric elements of R·i will be designated, respectively, by P ·i and I ·i . For themoment, we are not making any assumptions about how R·i relates to ci (S), and aresimply defining R·i as a description of an individual’s mental ranking of availableoptions, prior to making the choice.At the collective level, a social choice may be obtained by combining individualchoices through a collective decision-making mechanism. For the sake of simplicity,we assume that each individual in N has only one choice set, ci (S), generated fromexactly two motives, RUi and RMi , which will be described below. Our approach inthis paper however could easily be generalised to more than two motives. Let I ⊆ Nbe any non-empty subset (group) of individuals. Note that we allow a group to consistof only one individual. Let us denote the set of all such subsets of individuals by Q.For any I ∈ Q that has reached consensus on a particular collective decision, we123508 S. Silva-Leander, S. Sethdenote the collective choice set corresponding to that group simply as the intersectionof individual observable choice sets: cI(S) ≡ ∩i∈Ici (S), where the number of peoplereaching consensus to a collective decision within group I is denoted by its cardinality|I|. We assume cI(S) is non-empty.Suppose the collective choice of group L ∈ Q prevails as the social choice, which,in our framework, is treated as a concensus decision. We do not need to make anyassumption about the way in which any consensus is reached, other than the factthat each individual i ∈ L has equal influence over the consensus decision. Ourformulation can thus accommodate all possible decision makingmechanisms, rangingfrom absolute dictatorship when the decisive group consists of only one individual,to unanimity rule when the consensus size is equal to the number of individuals in thepopulation, to absolute majority rule when the concensus size is more than half of thenumber of individuals in the population.For our purpose in the paper, we will make a distinction between two fundamentaltypes of motives described by Harsanyi (1955) and Sen (1977). One is subjective, self-centred or idiosyncratic motives and the other is ethical, moral or reasoned motives.The idiosyncratic motives are defined as yielding a private preference ordering RUi∀i ∈ N , such that there exists i, j ∈ N , i = j , such that RUi = RUj . Thus, idiosyncraticmotives are defined by the fact that there exists at least two individuals for which themotives diverge. The reasoned motives, on the other hand, are defined as a singletonRMI for any group I ⊆ N such that RMi = RMI ∀i ∈ I. Reasoned motives are definedby the fact that they concord (i.e. are identical) across individuals within a group.Reasoned motives refer to the capacity of individual members of a group to recognisethat there is a common group interest that transcends their individual interests.2 Notethat each individual assesses options according to both motives, and the order of hisor her assessments does not affect the individual’s decision outcome. Moreover, thesemotives are assumed to be fixed and independent across individuals, which is reflectedby a property that we refer to as independence in Sect. 3.1.2.2 External observerBecause R·i ’s here represent mental states or motives, rather than actual choices, theyare never directly observed, and will have to be inferred by the external observerfrom the outcome of a choice process. The external observer does this by applying astandard Bayesian deductive logic to available information, where observed choicesare considered as the outcome of a stochastic process generated by unobservable events(underlying motives), which have a given probability of occurring. From the point of2 The specific form of rationality invoked under RMI can be thought of as a weak form of Kantian “purereason”. Formally, Kant defines pure reason as the “faculty of the unity of the rules of understanding underprinciples” (Kant 1781, p. A302/B359), that is the capacity for abstraction or universalisation. Judgment,then is the capacity “of thinking the particular as contained under the universal” (Kant 1790, p. 5:179), thatis to link a particular situation to a universal rule. In our model, RMI will coincide with a universal rule onlyin the specific case where I = N (see Proposition 1 below). Note that this definition of rationality does notrequire individuals to agree on all moral issues, since (a) RMI may only cover a small subset of options, and(b) final choices may be influenced also by idiosyncratic motives.123Revealed preferences with plural motives: axiomatic… 509view of the external observer who is making tentative inferences about unobservablephenomena, the underlying motives will thus be thought of as events.For the simplicity of exposition, from this point forward we consider only a fixedpair of options x ,y ∈ X such that x = y and introduce some additional notation. Weuse the notation  ·i = {ψ ·i ;χ ·i } to designate the set of possible events for chooser iover the pair of options x, y ∈ X , where ψ ·i = yP ·i x and χ ·i = x P ·i y.3 As usual, P ·ican be decomposed into weak preference relations, such that ψ ·i ≡ yR·i x & ¬x R·i yand χ ·i ≡ x R·i y & ¬yR·i x . Note that the external observer does not observe  ·i or itselements as this decision making process is internal to chooser i .The set of possible observable outcomes associated with  ·i is written as i ={ω∅i ;ωxi ;ωyi }, where the elements in the set are defined as follows for the pair x, y ∈ Xand for any i ∈ N :• ω∅i ≡ x, y /∈ ci (S) and x, y ∈ S (i.e. i chooses neither x nor y when both areavailable).• ωxi ≡ x ∈ ci (S) and y ∈ S\ci (S) (i.e. i chooses only x when both x and y areavailable).• ωyi ≡ y ∈ ci (S) and x ∈ S\ci (S) (i.e. i chooses only y when both x and y areavailable).The role of the external observer will be to attempt to estimate the conditionalprobability p( ·i | i ), given the external observer’s assumptions about the decisionmaking process linking unobservable events  ·i to observable outcomes i .As in the previous subsection, the subscript I will be used to describe the compo-nents pertaining to any group I ∈ Q. Thus, χUI , for instance, describes the unobservedevent that x PUi y occurs simultaneously for all i ∈ I, i.e., χUI ≡ ∩i∈IχUi . In otherwords, it describes a case in which there is a concordance of interests within the groupI. Similar group notation applies to other elements in the set of possible events.Similarly, ωxI denotes the observable collective choice outcome corresponding tothe consensus set cI (S), generated by the collective decision making mechanismof group I, whereby group I collectively chooses x over y, when y is available, i.e.,ωxI ≡ ∩i∈Iωxi . Similar group notation applies to other elements in the set of observableoutcomes. The set of all possible finite collective decision-making outcomes observedby the external observer, ω·I , reached by all I ∈ Q is denoted by Z (this includesindividual choice outcomes), which is the domain of the ranking of social outcomes.The end goal is to obtain a normative assessment of social outcomes. To this end,the external observer has to assign normative value to his inferred beliefs regardingthe motives of the chooser(s). From this point of view, the outcomes of the choiceprocess will be thought of as social states. Here, we will use the notation  to meanthat a given social state “is at least as good as”. Hence, ωxI  ωyI indicates that socialstate x of group I is preferrable from a normative point of view to social state y ofgroup I. Note that  has a symmetric and asymmetric element, denoted by ∼ and , respectively. The normative ranking of social states described by  should not be3 For simplicity, we leave out the case of indifference between options. In this paper, we are mainlyconcerned with collective choices typically taking the form of an exclusive choice between two or moreoptions, for instance, in an election.123510 S. Silva-Leander, S. Sethconfused with the positive description of individuals’ actual preferences over thosestates, noted RUi and RMi .Note that is only transitive on Z and cannot necessarily be reduced to a transitiveranking on outcomes because it takes both the outcome and the group of individualswho comprise consensus on that outcome as inputs. For example, if groups I,J ∈ Qboth agree on the public provision of health care, we could haveωxI ωxJ if |I| > |J |,which simply means that the normative force of group I’s preference for health careis greater than that of group J ’s preferences for health care.3 ModelIn order to draw inferences about unobservable motives from observable choices, theexternal observer defines a system of conditional probabilities, p (·), which definesthe set of possible outcomes that can be generated by a given combinations of events(motives). These constitute the observer’s beliefs about the way in which motives gen-erate observed choices. For tractability, we will impose some regularity assumptions(or rules for inference) on the set of conditional probabilities.3.1 Linking motives to social outcomesIn the presence of dual preferences, the decision-making processwill need to consist ofat least three separate stages. In the first two stages, the options are assessed separatelyaccording to the two motives, RUi and RMi . The specific order of the idiosyncratic andreasoned assessments does not influence the results of this paper. What matters is thattwo separate and independent assessments are carried out before the final choice ismade, which is stage three.Given that the external observer can only see the final choices made but not theunderlying motives that have led to the observed choice, the observer needs to imposea set of plausible assumptions, which we refer to as properties, about the decision-making process linking underlying preferences to choice. The properties will be statedas a system of conditional probabilities characterising the decision-making processfrom the point of view of the external observer.Anonymity (ANO) For all i, j ∈ N such that i = j and for x, y ∈ X , p(χUi | ωxi ) =p(χUj | ωxj ) and p(ψUi | ωyi ) = p(ψUj | ωyj ).The first property (ANO) captures the external observer’s assumption that theprobability that a given act is motivated by idiosyncratic motives is equal across allindividuals.Independence (IND) For any I ∈ Q such that |I| > 1 and for x, y ∈ X , p(χUI |ωxI) =∏i∈I p(χUi | ωxi ) and p(ψUI | ωyI) =∏i∈I p(ψUi | ωyi ).According the second property (IND), the external observer assumes that idiosyn-cratic motives of individuals are jointly independent within any subgroup of sizegreater than or equal to 2. In other words, the external observer assumes that individ-ual i’s preference for, say, x over y is not influenced bywhether other individualswithin123Revealed preferences with plural motives: axiomatic… 511the same group prefer x over y. This does not necessarily imply that the chooser’sidiosyncratic motives must be independent of others’ idiosyncratic motives, but sim-ply that the external observer does not have any information on whether and how suchrelations exist. Inferring dependence in individual motives by the external observerwill require further assumptions that we do not consider in this paper.Completeness (COM) For any I ∈ Q and for x, y ∈ X , p(χUI ∪χMI | ω·I)+ p(ψUI ∪ψMI | ω·I) = 1.The third property (COM) states that a given observed act, ω·I , must have beenmotivated either by χUI ∪ χMI or by ψUI ∪ ψMI . Note that ω·I may represent either ωxior ωyi or ω∅i .Coherence (COH) For any I ∈ Q and for x, y ∈ X , p(ψ ·I | ωxI) = 0 and p(χ ·I |ωyI) = 0.This fourth property (COH) states that if a group I (which may consist of a singleindividual) is observed to have chosen x over y, then the external observer infers thatI could not have strongly preferred y over x , neither under idiosyncratic motives norunder moral motives. Similar statement applies when y is observed to be chosen overx . This is a Pareto axiom, stating that if preferences go in one direction, choice cannotgo in the other direction.4Uncertainty (UNC) For any I, J ∈ Q\{N } and for x, y ∈ X , p(χUI ∩ χMI | ωxI) =p(χUJ ∩ χMJ | ωxJ ) and p(ψUI ∩ ψMI | ωyI) = p(ψUJ ∩ ψMJ | ωyJ ).The final property (UNC) states that when the external observer observes that agroup has chosen, say, x over y, and it is possible for all idiosyncratic motives withinthat group to concord, the external observer acknowledges that there is a possibility ofthe decision being reached by a combination of both idiosyncratic and moral motives.However, in the absence of any information about the underlying decision makingmechanisms, he assumes that the overlap between idiosyncratic and moral motives isthe same across groups.5 This property is only used to obtain the result in Corollary 1.The five properties impose natural restrictions on beliefs based on observed choices,which will help the external observer to draw inference on unobservable motives fromobserved choice outcomes. In order to assign normative value to these choices, wemust introduce an additional axiom that links the positive inference to a normativerule. If, like Sen (1977), we consider that value stems from reason rather than fromother preferences, it is logical to make the normative value of a given choice directlyproportional on the probability that it is caused by RMi and inversely proportional tothe probability that it is caused by RUi . We do this by using the following normative4 Note that in the single preference case, property COH reduces to p(ψUi | ωxi ) = 0, which could arguablybe considered as a formal representation of Sen’s (1971, 1977) interpretation of the Axiom of RevealedPreference (ARP) as a normative inference claim (“revelation”) about underlying utility-maximising pref-erences (i.e. “if we observe that i chooses x over y, when y is available, then we can infer that i did notprefer y to x under the relation RUi ”). This should be contrasted against the usual interpretation of the ARPas a descriptive equivalence claim (i.e. “if i chooses x over y, when y is available, we say that i does notprefer y to x under the relation R·i ”).5 One may extend this simplified property by assuming a distribution of the probabilities of overlap.123512 S. Silva-Leander, S. Sethaxiom, called Probability-Based Rankings, which states that the external observer(1) normatively prefers the social outcome that is less likely to have been causedby idiosyncratic motives (i.e. a convergence of self-interests), and (2) is normativelyindifferent between two social states that have equal probability of having been causedby idiosyncratic motives. In other words, from the perspective of the external observer,a greater concordance of choices made under idiosyncratic motives would not carrymore normative strength, as such concordance would be merely coincidental, andcould be reversed if the external interests leading to the choice were to change.Probability-Based Rankings (PBR) For x, y ∈ X and for any I,J ∈ Q andωxI , ωxJ ∈ Z ,ωxI ωxJ ⇔ p(χUI | ωxI) < p(χUJ | ωxJ ) (1a)ωxI ∼ ωxJ ⇔ p(χUI | ωxI) = p(χUJ | ωxJ ). (1b)4 ResultsIn this section, we present our results in the form of Lemma 1, Propositions 1 and 2.4.1 Inference from collective choicesThe first result is captured in Lemma 1, which states that the probability that a group’schoice is based on idiosyncratic motives is lower than for any of its proper subsets. Theintuition behind Lemma 1 is that the more thorough the vetting process (i.e. the moreindividuals who have to consent to a decision), the less likely it is that the collectivechoice outcome will result from a mere coincidence of self-interests.Lemma 1 For all I, A ∈ Q\{N } and for x, y ∈ X, we can use properties ANO andIND to infer that: A ⊂ I ⇒ p(χUI | ωxI) ≤ p(χUA | ωxA).Proof Let I, A ∈ Q\ {N } be two non-empty groups of individuals, such that A ⊂ I.It then follows that 0 < |A| < |I|.By property ANO, we already know that for all i, j ∈ N such that i = j ,p(χUi | ωxi ) = p(χUj | ωxj ). (2)By property IND along with Eq. (2), we getp(χUI | ωxI) = (p(χUi | ωxi ))|I|, (3)andp(χUA | ωxA) = (p(χUi | ωxi ))|A|. (4)Given that |A| < |I|, then comparing Eqs. (3) and (4), we obtain p(χUI | ωxI) ≤p(χUA | ωxA). 123Revealed preferences with plural motives: axiomatic… 513Lemma 1 has an intuitive corollary that may be obtained by using the UNC propertyalong with properties COM and COH.Corollary 1 For all I, A ∈ Q\ {N } and for x, y ∈ X, we can use properties ANO,IND, COM, COH, and UNC to infer that: A ⊂ I ⇒ p(χMI | ωxI) ≥ p(χMA | ωxA).Proof We already know from Lemma 1 that by properties ANO and IND,p(χUI | ωxI) ≤ p(χUA | ωxA). (5)Then, by property COH, we know that for any I ∈ Q and for x , y ∈ X , p(ψUI |ωxI) = 0 and p(ψMI | ωxI) = 0 and thus, p(ψUI ∪ ψMI | ωxI) = 0. Combined withproperty COM leads to, for any I ∈ Q and for x , y ∈ X :p(χUI ∪ χMI | ωxI) = 1. (6)It then follows that,p(χUI ∪ χMI | ωxI) = p(χUA ∪ χMA | ωxA). (7)Expanding both sides of Eq. (7), we obtain,p(χUI | ωxI) + p(χMI | ωxI) − p(χUI ∩ χMI | ωxI) = p(χUA | ωxA) + p(χMA | ωxA)− p(χUA ∩ χMA | ωxA). (8)Finally, by property UNC, we know thatp(χUI ∩ χMI | ωxI) = p(χUA ∩ χMA | ωxA). (9)Hence, by combining Eqs. (5), (8) and (9), we obtain p(χMI | ωxI) ≥ p(χMA | ωxA).Under the external observer’s assumption, stated in property UNC, Corollary 1intuitively states that more thorough the vetting process, the more likely it is that thecollective choice outcome will result from moral motives.The following proposition follows from the definition of idiosyncratic and reasonedmotives. Indeed, in the limit, as I tends to N , we can think of a hypothetical consensusinvolving all possible individuals in N with all possible combinations of motives.Proposition 1 For x, y ∈ X, ifI = N , thenwe can use the definitions of idiosyncraticand reasonedmotives alongwith properties COMandCOH to infer that: p(χUI ∪χMI |ωxI) = p(χMI | ωxI) = 1.Proof By the general property of additivity of probabilities, we have:p(χUI ∪ χMI | ωxI) = p(χUI | ωxI) + p(χMI | ωxI) − p(χUI ∩ χMI | ωxI). (10)123514 S. Silva-Leander, S. SethBy the construction of χUI , we can re-write Eq. (10) as:p(χUI ∪χMI | ωxI)= p(∩i∈IχUi | ωxI)+ p(χMI | ωxI)− p(∩i∈IχUi ∩χMI | ωxI). (11)Given that I = N , by the definition of idiosyncratic motives, we know that∩i∈NχUi = ∅. Hence, p(∩i∈IχUi | ωxI) = p(∅) = 0.Also, p(∩i∈NχUi ∩ χMI | ωxI) = p(∅ ∩ χMI | ωxI) = p(∅) = 0.Consequently, Eq. (11) boils down to:p(χUI ∪ χMI | ωxI) = p(χMI | ωxI). (12)By properties COH and COM, finally, we have p(χUI ∪ χMI | ωxI) = 1 as in (6).Hence, p(χMI | ωxI) = 1. Proposition 1 makes the point that we can only say with certainty that an observ-able outcome arises from moral motives in the hypothetical case in which there is aconsensus amongst all possible individuals in N who have ever existed and could everexist. In all other real-life cases, we will thus be dealing with uncertain and tentativenormative judgements.4.2 Normative ranking of social choicesWenow prove Proposition 2, which states that, given the properties and the PBR axiomoutlined in Sect. 3, the normative strength of an option will be directly dependent onthe number of individuals who are able to agree on its value.Proposition 2 For all I, J ∈ Q\{N }, for x, y ∈ X and for a system of conditionalprobabilities p(·) that satisfies properties ANO and IND, if the induced relation satisfies PBR and is binary, transitive and reflexive on observed choices ωxI , ωxJ ∈ Z ,then |I| > |J | ⇒ ωxI  ωxJ .Proof For any I,J ∈ Q\ {N }, suppose |I| > |J | and let A ⊂ I such that |A| = |J |.As p(·) satisfies properties ANO and IND, by Lemma 1, we already know thatA ⊂ I ⇒ p(χUI | ωxI) ≤ p(χUA | ωxA). (13)Following PBR then we get p(χUI | ωxI) ≤ p(χUA | ωxA) ⇒ ωxI  ωxA.If we can show that p(χUA | ωxA) = p(χUJ | ωxJ ), then that will complete our proof.By property ANO, we already know that for all i, j ∈ N such that i = j ,p(χUi | ωxi ) = p(χUj | ωxj ). (14)Given that A,J ⊆ N , the relation in Eq. (14) holds for all i, j ∈ A as well as forall i, j ∈ J .123Revealed preferences with plural motives: axiomatic… 515Note that we have assumed both |A| > 1 and |J | > 1. Then by property IND, weobtainp(χUJ | ωxJ ) =∏i∈Jp(χUi | ωxi ) (15)andp(χUA | ωxA) =∏i∈Ap(χUi | ωxi ). (16)By our assumption of |A| = |J |, combining Eqs. (14), (15) and (16) we obtain,p(χUA | ωxA) = p(χUJ | ωxJ ).Then, by PBR (1b), we get p(χUA | ωxA) = p(χUJ | ωxJ ) ⇒ ωxA ∼ ωxJ .Finally, since  is transitive over Z , it follows that ωxI  ωxA and ωxA ∼ ωxJ ⇒ωxI  ωxJ . Proposition 2 captures Sen’s (2004) notion of normative validation through a pro-cess of inter-rational testing, e.g. through public discussion or reasoned argument(see also Popper 1980, p. 111). As such, it supports the intuitively appealing idea thatmajority consensus carriesmore “normative” forcewhen themajority forming the con-sensus is larger (e.g. the United States vs. Lichtenstein, or the Universal Declarationof Human Rights, vs. the European Convention on Human Rights). At the same time,it recognises the limitations of such processes, highlighting the historically verifiedfact that free democratic decisions do not by themselves guarantee outcomes (exceptin the hypothetical case of a consensus involving an infinite number of preferenceprofiles following the result presented in Proposition 1).65 ConclusionsIn a recent paper, Ravallion (2011) rightly criticised the weights used in multidimen-sional indices for lacking the sort of theoretical justification that allows neoclassicaleconomists to claim that “market prices are defensible weights on quantities inmeasuring national income” (Ravallion 2011, p. 3). However, as Sen (1987) hasargued repeatedly, the normative claims of neoclassical economics are contingenton the acceptance of an essentially utilitarian normative standpoint and descriptionof human nature, which is far from uncontroversial. Furthermore, even if we acceptsuch premises, there are well-studied theoretical and normative shortcoming in theclassical model of the rational self-interested decision-maker (Sen 1977; Rubinsteinand Salant 2012, etc.).6 One alternative interpretation of the results in this paper could be as follows: suppose an agent has a truepreference that is fixed across time but in every period there is an idiosyncratic shock (modelled as givingrise to a new binary relation) that lead to choices that are “errors” with regards to the agent’s true preference.The data constitutes this agent’s choices in different time periods. The result then states that the longer thestretch of time where the agent chooses the same alternative from a fixed menu, the more likely it is toreveal her true preferences.123516 S. Silva-Leander, S. SethIn this paper, we have tried to explore the possibility of relaxing some of the mostenduring assumptions of this model in order to make it more compatible with the non-utilitarian description of human nature proposed by Sen. In particular, we have shownthat it is possible to develop a normative ranking that starts from the assumption ofpluralmotivations. Themodel focuses on the specific issue of non-utilitarian normativerankings, and does not look into other criticisms that have been levied against thestandard choice model, regarding, for instance, incoherent choices (Hammond 1976),temptation (Kopylov 2012), regret (Stoye 2011), etc. As such, it can be subjected tomany of the same critiques and variations as the standard model to explore real-worlddeviations from this theoretical benchmark.We believe that the findings presented in this paper have practical implicationsfor normative economic assessments, notably when using so-called multidimensionalpoverty indices, since it provides a theoretical foundation that is currently lacking forassigningweights in the construction of such indices. In particular, themodel presentedin this paper is compatible with a rights-based approach to determination of weights,based, for instance, on normative frameworks, such as the international declaration ofhuman rights or other documents that have gone through a process of inter-rationalvalidation. Potentially, the findings of this paper, could also have applications in otherareas of normative economics, which currently rely, explicitly or implicitly, on theaxiom of revealed preference to assign normative value to social outcomes.Acknowledgements We wish to thank Gaston Yalonetsky, Constanze Binder, Sabina Alkire, and FrancesStewart for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.
