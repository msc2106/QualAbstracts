ABSTRACT: 
Links between urban green infrastructure (UGI) and public health benefits are becoming well established. Despite this, how UGI is distributed varies widely. Although not a universal finding, sectors of society that are disadvantaged often suffer from poor provision, something which might be due to which UGI are examined. We assess the distribution of street trees and public greenspaces (two types of publicly-owned and accessible UGI) across the city of Bradford, UK which is characterised by high levels of inequality and variation in ethno-racial background. We do this through statistical and spatial analyses. Street tree density was distributed unevenly and was highest in neighbourhoods with a high proportion of Asian/Asian British residents and with lower socio-economic status. Conversely, neighbourhoods with better access to public greenspaces were characterised by high income and/or a high proportion of White households. While the quality of public greenspace was spatially clustered, there were only limited spatial associations with ethno-racial group or socio-economic status. Population density was a key determinant of the distribution of UGI, suggesting understanding UGI distributions should also focus on urban form. Nevertheless, within the same city we show that equitable distribution of UGI differs according to the form and characteristics of UGI. To fully realise the public health benefits of UGI, it is necessary to map provision and understand the causal drivers of unequal distributions. This would facilitate interventions that promote equitable distributions of UGI based on the needs of the target populations.

FULL TEXT: 
 1. IntroductionRapid expansion of urban areas and human populations began inthe late 20th century and will continue in the coming decades, witharound 70% of people estimated to be living in towns and cities by 2050(United Nations, 2014). Consequently, natural landscapes are becomingless accessible to increasingly urbanized societies. As natural environ-ments have been found to enhance human health and wellbeing(Hartig, Mitchell, de Vries, & Frumkin, 2014), such a reduction in ac-cessibility will have detrimental effects on the quality of life of citydwellers through, for example, a lack of recreational space and in-creased exposure to pollutants (Lovasi, Quinn, Neckerman,Perzanowski, & Rundle, 2008; Nisbet & Zelenski, 2011).Urban green infrastructure (UGI; including all green elements suchas parks, public greenspaces, green corridors, street trees, urban forests,green roofs and private domestic gardens (Tzoulas et al., 2007)) hasemerged as a concept which can help facilitate the inclusion of naturalelements within the urban planning process (Sandström, 2002). Bydefining, and subsequently valuing, its benefits (Gómez-Baggethun &Barton, 2013), UGI provision can be weighed against competing prio-rities for city planners, such as housing and infrastructure development(Elmqvist et al., 2015; Groenewegen, van den Berg, Maas, Verheij, & deVries, 2012; Norton et al., 2015). Providing UGI could, therefore, be aneffective way of mitigating the loss of natural environments within ci-ties undergoing processes of densification, and thus enhance humanhealth and wellbeing for a wide cross-section of urbanised societies(Dallimer et al., 2011; Pauleit, Ennos, & Golding, 2005). Numerousstudies point to the health benefits of UGI such as improved mental andphysical health (Dadvand et al., 2014; Gascon et al., 2016 McEachanet al., 2016; van den Berg et al., 2015, 2016). Although there is con-siderable evidence for these benefits, knowledge of the pathways thatproduce them remains limited (Markevych et al., 2017). Reasons maybe a combination of mechanisms, including reducing exposure toharmful pollutants, facilitating physical activity and providing stressreducing environments (Hartig et al., 2014). UGI has also been shownto reduce the impact of extreme weather events (Zhang, Xie, Zhang, &https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.03.020Received 3 March 2017; Received in revised form 20 March 2018; Accepted 21 March 2018⁎ Corresponding author at: Sustainability Research Institute, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds, Leeds, West Yorkshire LS2 9JT, UK.1 Current address: Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning, Faculty of Geosciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.E-mail address: M.Dallimer@leeds.ac.uk (M.

There is, however, potential for ne-gative outcomes, most notably increased exposure to allergens, towhich urban populations can be more susceptible (Cariñanos & Casares-Porcel, 2011), economic and social costs associated with maintenance(Heynen, Perkins, & Roy, 2006) and the possibility of spaces facilitatingcrime or being perceived as dangerous (Bogar & Beyer, 2016). Never-theless, recent studies have called for an increase in greenspace provi-sion and inclusion in health promotion policies (Nieuwenhuijsen,Khreis, Triguero-Mas, Gascon, & Dadvand, 2017; van den Bosch &Nieuwenhuijsen, 2017).Aside from private spaces such as domestic gardens and many greenroofs, urban green infrastructure is an inclusive element of towns andcities that is freely accessible to all. Therefore, given that some benefitsof UGI can be considered public goods (i.e. they are non-rivalrous andnon-excludable), UGI, especially when provided and maintained bymunicipal authorities, could be an effective way of enhancing the li-veability of cities for all residents, regardless of socio-demographicbackground (Hughey et al., 2016; Lee & Maheswaran, 2011). Moreover,research shows a reduction in health inequalities related to incomedeprivation in mortality rates and circulatory disease, in greener areas,indicating deprived areas have the most to gain from urban greening(Mitchell & Popham, 2008). Despite such potential, UGI tends to beunevenly spatially distributed through urban areas, often resulting inethnic/racial minorities (Heynen et al., 2006; Landry & Chakraborty,2009; Wolch, Wilson, & Fehrenbach, 2013) and/or those of lower socio-economic status having comparatively worse provision, or quality ofprovision, than their counterparts (Vaughan et al., 2013). Numerousmethodologically varied studies have shown this phenomenon in termsof accessibility, frequency, size and quality (Boone, Buckley, Grove, &Sister, 2009; Hughey et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2015; Tooke,Klinkenber, & Coops, 2010). However, these patterns are not universal;in some cities ethno-racial minorities or those of lower socio-economicstatus have better provision of UGI (Barbosa et al., 2007; Jones,Brainard, Bateman, & Lovett, 2009; Kessel et al., 2009).Variation in the patterns of distribution of UGI may, in part, be dueto which forms and characteristics of UGI are studied and how equity isassessed. Some studies examine publicly provided UGI, such as streettrees (Landry & Chakraborty, 2009; Lovasi et al., 2008) or public parks(Barbosa et al., 2007; Boone et al., 2009; Comber, Brunsdon, & Green,2008; Hughey et al., 2016; Vaughan et al., 2013; Wolch et al., 2013;Zhou & Kim, 2013); others do not distinguish between UGI which ispublicly accessible and that which is not, by examining urban tree ca-nopy cover (Heynen et al., 2006; Schwarz et al., 2015; Zhou & Kim,2013) or the abundance of vegetation/greenness (Li, Zhang, Li,Kuzovkina, & Weiner, 2015; Pham, Apparicio, Séguin, Landry, &Gagnon, 2012; Tooke et al., 2010).While we might expect uneven distribution of privately owned UGI,as higher income residents can both afford to own larger plots of landallowing for more private greenspace (Pearce, 2003) and often havemore social capital, which allows them greater influence over theirneighbourhoods (Kendal, Williams, & Williams, 2012; Pham, Apparicio,Landry, Séguin, & Gagnon, 2013; Shanahan, Lin, Gaston, Bush, & Fuller,2014), publicly owned or maintained UGI should conceivably be sub-ject to a higher level of distributional scrutiny. Indeed, were the healthand wellbeing of all residents to be prioritised, we might expect pub-licly owned UGI to be evenly distributed or even to favour neighbour-hoods with little provision of private greenspaces (Boone et al., 2009;Landry & Chakraborty, 2009; Pham et al., 2012).Current findings are inconsistent in terms of provision and qualityfor ethnic minorities and lower socio-economic groups. Here, within themulti-ethnic and socioeconomically diverse city of Bradford, UK, weassess the distribution, and quality (an often-overlooked but importantfactor in assessing equity in UGI; Hughey et al., 2016) of UGI. We an-swer the research question that certain communities are systematicallydiscriminated against. The environmental equity hypothesis, whichstates that different demographics and socio-economic groups should beequally impacted by environmental benefits and burdens, provides aframework to assess our question (Cutter, 1995; Downey & Hawkins,2008; Wen, Zhang, Harris, Holt, & Croft, 2013).2. Methods2.1. Study systemDespite cities in the UK often being characterised by a diverse ethnicmake-up, deprivation and income levels (Elvers, Gross, & Heinrichs,2008; Rutt & Gulsrud, 2016) few studies of how UGI is distributedacross socio-demographic or ethno-racial groups have thus far beenFig. 1. The location of Bradford within the United Kingdom (right). Coordinates: 53.7960° N, 1.7594° W. The left-hand panel shows the 218 Lower Layer SuperOutput Areas (LSOAs) with over 15% of their area covered by built land uses, which were contiguous with the urban core of the city, are shown in grey. UnshadedLSOAs were not included in the study.M. Ferguson et al. Landscape and Urban Planning 175 (2018) 136–148137carried out. Our study is based in the city of Bradford in NorthernEngland (Fig. 1). With a current population of 531,176 (ONS, 2016),Bradford developed rapidly during the industrial revolution. However,since the mid-20th century, much of the original industry has been lost,and in this time the city became a destination for immigrant popula-tions predominantly from South Asian countries such as India, Pakistanand Bangladesh (Hall, 2013). Now well established, these ethno-racialgroups account for 19.8% of the population (Bradford BradfordObservatory, 2012). However, in some central areas the proportion ofnon-White residents rises to 85% (Kelly, 2015; ONS, 2011). In additionto an ethnically diverse population, Bradford is characterised by highlevels of income inequality, including neighbourhoods ranking amongstthe most and least deprived in the country. As a whole, the city itself isone of the most deprived in the country, with high levels of deprivationcentred in ethnic minority communities (Bradford Observatory, 2010).This is typical of the UK where South Asian populations are generallyless affluent and more segregated than in other countries, such as Ca-nada and U.S., where similar levels of immigration have occurred(Johnston, Poulsen, & Forrest, 2007).The municipal authority boundary for Bradford includes bothcountryside and smaller villages. We therefore concentrated on theurban areas of Bradford (Fig. 1). We defined this as all Lower LayerSuper Output Areas (LSOA; the second smallest scale division for whichcensus and other demographic data are available in the UK (ONS, 2014)which had at least 15% of their area covered by built land uses (roads,buildings and other sealed surfaces (OS Street View, 2013); and werecontiguous with the central urban core of the City of Bradford itself.This excluded from our analysis both rural areas and smaller satellitetowns to the north and west of the city while ensuring the inclusion ofLSOAs on Bradford’s urban fringe. Of the 310 LSOAs in the municipalityof Bradford, we included 218 LSOAs with a total population of 373,794residents (ONS, 2011) in our analyses.2.2. Data collection and processingWe carried out our analyses at the LSOA level, which typically in-clude 1000–3000 residents (mean=1560) (Bates, 2008). This meanstheir spatial extent is variable (mean area= 0.46 km2; Fig. 1). LSOAsrepresent an appropriate unit of analysis to assess equity in UGI as thereis likely to be variation of provision and accessibility of UGI over thestudy system, and they are sufficiently small to capture this in a denseurban area (Pham et al., 2012; Schwarz et al., 2015; Shanahan et al.,2014). The size of spatial aerial units can be important when examiningenvironmental equity (e.g. Schwarz et al., 2015). However what re-search there is on methodological issues of this type, suggests that whenusing UK census data, the choice of aerial unit makes little or no dif-ference to findings (Flowerdew, 2011).From the 2011 UK census (ONS, 2011) we extracted ethnicity,household deprivation and population statistics for each LSOA (Table 1;Fig. 2). Mean household deprivation was used to represent socio-eco-nomic status within an LSOA. It is a multi-dimensional measure, ran-ging between 0 and 4 for each household based on employment,education, health, disability and housing (ONS, 2014). Using multipleindicators makes it a more effective measure of socio-economic statusthan median household income, which is often employed in studies onenvironmental equity (Galobardes, 2006; Nolan & Whelan, 2010). Al-though the indicator does not cover all aspects of a household’s socio-economic status, it is readily available through the census making iteasily and widely applicable. In the UK census data, ethnic categoriesare reported as percentages for each LSOA. Within Bradford, 85% of thepopulation report as either ‘White’ (English/Welsh/Scottish/NorthernIrish/British, Irish, Gypsy or Irish Traveller, Other White) or ‘Asian/Asian British’ (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Other Asian),with the remaining ethnicity categories not well represented (ONS,2012). To allow for meaningful analysis, we only used the ethno-racialcategories of ‘White’ and ‘Asian/Asian British’. As is often the case whenforming categorisations for census data these combine ethnic, racialand national characteristics. This part of our analysis is, therefore,comparing two distinctly different, yet amalgamated, ethno-racialgroups (Aspinall, 2013; Byrne & Wolch, 2009; Johnston et al., 2007).Finally, we calculated population density (total population/LSOA area),which we used as a proxy for urban density, thus accounting for someaspects of urban form (Mellander, Lobo, Stolarick, & Matheson, 2015).2.3. Urban green infrastructureFor the purposes of this paper, we use Naumann’s et al. (2011)definition for the European Commission of UGI: ‘Green infrastructure isthe network of natural and semi-natural areas, features and greenspacesin rural and urban, and terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine areas,which together enhance ecosystem health and resilience, contribute tobiodiversity conservation and benefit human populations through themaintenance and enhancement of ecosystem services. Green infra-structure can be strengthened through strategic and co-ordinated in-itiatives that focus on maintaining, restoring, improving and connectingexisting areas and features as well as creating new areas and features.’This definition encompasses natural and semi-natural features, and al-though it emphasises strategic initiatives, this is not a pre-requisite, andtherefore it allows the inclusion of remnant greenspaces and vegetation(including trees) which has grown within urban areas without in-tentionally being planted.2.4. Street tree densityStreet trees are defined as trees on public land beside roads (Landry& Chakraborty, 2009). Publicly owned and managed, street trees re-present a highly visible and potentially ubiquitous feature of the urbannatural environment. They have been shown to deliver benefits such asreducing asthma rates and improving social cohesion for residents(Lovasi et al., 2008; Mullaney, Lucke, & Trueman, 2015; Peckham,Duinker, & Ordóñez, 2013; Ulmer et al., 2016). Disservices, for in-stance, blocking pathways and causing damage to property, if they arenot adequately maintained, have also been noted (Heynen et al., 2006).The City of Bradford have committed to conserving and maintainingtheir existing 18,000 street trees and have mapped the location andcanopy extent of the entire portfolio. Maps were generated by com-bining high-resolution aerial photography with highway data. Each treewas assigned co-ordinates and cross-referenced with Google Street Viewto ensure accuracy, allowing us to calculate street tree density (treeskm−2) for each LSOA (Fig. 3A).2.5. Neighbourhood greenspace accessibilityTo calculate a measure of greenspace accessibility for each LSOA,we made use of the City of Bradford’s public greenspace database(which includes parks and gardens, outdoor sports facilities and ame-nity greenspaces; (City of Bradford MDC, 2006). In the UK, the Acces-sible Natural Greenspace Standard (ANGSt) recommends that everyoneTable 1Socio-demographic and urban green infrastructure (UGI) variables for LSOAs inBradford, UK.Number ofLSOAsMedian (to 3 s.f.;interquartile range)Household Deprivation (0–4) 218 1.11 (0.889–1.36)White (%) 218 73.9 (34.1–90.6)Asian/Asian British (%) 218 18.1 (3.85–56.0)Street tree Density (km−2) 218 129 (65.5–234)Neighbourhood GreenspaceAccessibility (%)218 61.0 (22.8–83.0)Greenspace Quality (%) 203 55.5 (52.5–60.6)M. Ferguson et al. Landscape and Urban Planning 175 (2018) 136–148138should live within 300m of greenspace at least 2 ha in size; as this is adistance perceived by potential users to be accessible both to those withdisabilities and to children (Natural England, 2010). ANGSt standardsrecommend that an ‘Equality Impact Assessment’ in line with theirguidelines is undertaken to ensure that greenspace provision accom-modates all potential users. In line with these national guidelines ourmeasure assesses the Euclidean distance to greenspace. While Euclidiandistances have known drawbacks, such as not taking into accountbarriers to pedestrians or a lack of walking routes (cf. Higgs, Fry, &Langford, 2012), and will not always match residents’ perceptions ofaccessibility (which can be influenced by the characteristics of thegreenspaces themselves, as well as socio-demographic makeup of po-pulations (Jones, Hillsdon, & Coombes, 2009; Maroko, Maantay, Sohler,Grady, & Arno, 2009), it aligns with current policy definitions, andallows accessibility to be quantified across a wide area relatively easily.Further, although the use of network distances (i.e. the distance alongtransport routes) has become more commonplace, the two measurestend to be highly correlated and any differences between them lessenedin urban areas (Jones, Ashby, Momin, & Naidoo, 2010). In line with thenational standards, we excluded greenspaces that were smaller than2 ha and also those not open to the wider public (e.g. school groundsand golf courses). The ANGSt provides a broad definition of naturalenvironments. We therefore considered open countryside as publiclyaccessible greenspace (Natural England, 2010) and included country-side (land with human population density of below 1500 people km−2ONS, 2013; OS Street View, 2013) within our greenspace categorisa-tion. Based on Euclidean distances we applied a 300m measurementaround our greenspaces and calculated the percentage of each LSOAthat had sufficient access to a public greenspace according to nationalguidelines (Fig. 3B).2.6. Greenspace qualityGreenspace quality was measured using the Natural EnvironmentScoring Tool (NEST) (Gidlow et al., 2018), a version of the Neigh-bourhood Green Space Tool (NGST) (Gidlow, Ellis, & Bostock, 2012)Fig. 2. Spatial variation in socio-demographics across LSOAs within Bradford, UK. (A) Mean household deprivation score; (B) % self-reporting as White; and (C) %self-reporting as Asian/Asian British.M. Ferguson et al. Landscape and Urban Planning 175 (2018) 136–148139adapted for PHENOTYPE (Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2014). Observersscore each greenspace based on access, recreational facilities, ame-nities, natural features, non-natural features, incivilities, safety andusage. The NGST itself is a moderately good indicator (i.e. differentobservers score the same features in the same way) for both individualdomains within the Tool (ICC=0.575–0.948) and overall qualityscores (ICC= 0.727, p < 0.001) (Gidlow et al., 2012). We included 34greenspace quality audits in our analyses that fell within our study area(out of 45 in total audited for a separate study (Roberts et al., in re-view). Greenspace quality scores, were based on the average score fromtwo independent assessors. The level of agreement calculated betweenobservers was high (ICC= 0.90, p < 0.001).The NEST is applicable to many greenspace typologies so we fo-cused on the most relevant aspects for urban residents. Due to the effectthat elements of greenspace can have on the perception of users and,consequently, the benefits it can provide we weighted more strongly theNEST categories that contained more relevant data, when calculatingthe overall NEST scores. Levels of neglect (e.g. maintenance/qualityand incivilities; Dallimer et al., 2014), perception of safety (Maas et al.,2009), abundance of natural/semi-natural features (Aesthetics – Nat-ural Features; Dallimer et al., 2012; Fuller, Irvine, Devine-Wright,Warren, & Gaston, 2007; Lin, Fuller, Bush, Gaston, & Shanahan, 2014)and accessibility (Access; del Saz Salazar & García Menéndez, 2007)were highlighted as important in this context and were thereforeweighted more strongly. We excluded two elements, usability for watersports & fishing, as they were not relevant for the urban greenspaces inour study.Each LSOA was given a greenspace quality score which was aweighted average based on the relative coverage by the differentgreenspace’s catchment which overlapped with the area of the LSOA(Fig. 3C). ANGSt defines a greenspace’s catchment according to its size,with larger parks having a larger catchment, representing how residentstypically travel further to utilise them (Natural England, 2010;Schipperijn, Stigsdotter, Randrup, & Troelsen; Rossi, Byrne, &Fig. 3. Spatial variation in the distribution of urban green infrastructure across Bradford, UK. (A) Street tree density (trees km−2); (B) accessible neighbourhoodgreenspace, a measure derived from the Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard (ANGSt); and (C) greenspace quality, which was calculated using the NaturalEnvironment Scoring Tool.M. Ferguson et al. Landscape and Urban Planning 175 (2018) 136–148140Pickering, 2015). For the purposes of our study, a greenspace catch-ment is the buffer applied around each greenspace according to ANGStguidelines. We assumed that populations within that catchment havetheir provision of greenspace met. Greenspaces of less than 20 ha pro-vide a 300m catchment; over 20 ha spaces provide a 2 km catchmentand spaces over 100 ha provide a 5 km catchment (Natural England,2010). Fifteen LSOAs were excluded from this part of the analysis, asthey did not fall within any catchments. Due to the variety of possiblemethods of deriving greenspace quality, sensitivity analysis was un-dertaken using (i) NEST standard weightings and (ii) increasingcatchments to 500m for greenspaces less than 20 ha. Similar resultswere observed, so our custom NEST weightings and standard ANGStcatchments were used, and are reported here.2.7. Data analysisWe tested for associations between socio-demographic and UGIvariables using Spearman’s rank correlations. However, we also wantedto understand the strength of associations between ethno-racial/socio-economic status and UGI provision independently of human populationdensity and so we performed a non-parametric partial correlation. Weused a Mann-Witney U test to identify differences in the socio-demo-graphic characteristics of LSOAs with high and low levels of UGI pro-vision. For street trees we divided LSOAs according to median density(129 trees km−2), while accessibility was separated into high and lowprovision (more/less 50% of the area of the LSOA with good access),and greenspace quality was divided along its median score of 55.5. Allstatistical analyses were carried out in SPSS.Spatial analysis was undertaken using GeoDa 1.6.7 (Anselin, Syabri,& Kho, 2006). Global univariate Moran’s I value derives spatial auto-correlation through correlating the variable against a spatiallyweighted predictor, thereby indicating the strength of spatial relation-ships throughout a sample, with local indicators of spatial association(LISA) visualising clusters. As we were interested in UGI distributions inrelation to socio-demographics, we used bivariate Moran’s I and LISAmaps with a spatially weighted queen contiguity-based predictor. Thiswas done at a significance level of 0.05 and tested with 999 permuta-tions, ensuring stability within the results and providing an ‘ad hoc’sensitivity analysis (Anselin et al., 2006).3. Results3.1. Street treesStreet tree density was positively correlated with household depri-vation (rs=0.337, p < 0.01), and remained so when accounting forpopulation density (rs=0.203, p < 0.01) (Table 2, Fig. 4A). Therewere significant differences in household deprivation between LSOAswith high and low densities of street trees (U=4258.5, p < 0.01,N= 218) (Table 3). For ethno-racial groups, street tree density wasnegatively associated with the percentage of residents self-reporting asWhite (rs=−0.358, p < 0.01) and positively associated with thoseself-reporting as Asian/Asian British (rs=0.323, p < 0.01) (Table 2,Fig. 4B,C). These associations remained when accounting for popula-tion density, with the proportion of White residents negatively asso-ciated (rs=−0.196, p < 0.01), and the proportion of Asian/AsianBritish residents positively associated (rs=0.162, p < 0.05) (Table 2).LSOAs with above median street tree density were characterised by asignificantly higher proportion of Asian/Asian British residents(U=4178, p < 0.01, N=218) (Table 3), and a lower proportion ofWhite residents (U=4000.5, p < 0.01, N=218).Spatially, household deprivation was clustered with street treedensity (I= 0.220, z= 6.6908, p < 0.001) (Figs. 5 and 6A). In termsof ethno-racial groups, self-reporting White residents in LSOAs dis-played spatial outliers (I=−0.285, z=−8.788, p < 0.001), whileself-reporting Asian/Asian British residents displayed spatial clusterswith street tree density (I= 0.273, z= 8.255, p < 0.001).3.2. Neighbourhood greenspace accessibilityThe total percentage of the city within 300m of a greenspace was65.6%. The proportion of an LSOA with accessible neighbourhoodgreenspace was weakly negatively associated with household depriva-tion (rs=−0.142, p < 0.05) (Table 2, Fig. 4D). Additionally, LSOAswith fewer deprived households had a greater proportion of their areaaccessible to neighbourhood greenspaces (U= 4645.5, p < 0.01,N= 218) (Table 3). Accessibility was associated with ethno-racialgroups. It was positively correlated with the proportion of residentswho were White (rs=0.241, p < 0.01), but negatively correlated withthe proportion of residents who were Asian/Asian British (rs=−0.235,p < 0.01) (Table 2, Fig. 4E, F).

DiscussionUrban green infrastructure includes a wide range of different nat-ural and semi-natural features that are present in towns and cities.Reflecting this, we found a variety of associations between the dis-tribution of publicly owned forms and characteristics of UGI, namelystreet trees and greenspace accessibility and quality, with householddeprivation and ethno-racial groupings. Street tree density was higherin neighbourhoods with higher proportion of Asian/British Asian re-sidents and levels of household deprivation. In common with otherstudies (e.g. Comber et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2009; Wolch et al., 2013),accessibility to greenspaces was higher in neighbourhoods with lowerlevels of deprivation and a lower proportion of ethnic minority re-sidents. However, greenspace quality was largely unrelated to variationFig. 5.

Ferguson et al. Landscape and Urban Planning 175 (2018) 136–148144in deprivation, ethno-racial group or population density, despite sub-stantial spatial variation throughout the sample. For different forms andcharacteristics of UGI, there were, therefore, contrasting spatial pat-terns and distributions according to ethno-racial groups and depriva-tion. Our results emphasize the need to assess multiple forms andcharacteristics of UGI when wishing to understand the extent to whichenvironmental public goods are distributed equitably across sectors ofsociety. This is particularly important, considering different types ofUGI can provide separate benefits independent from each other(Peschardt, Schipperijn, & Stigsdotter, 2012; Ulmer et al., 2016).The forms and characteristics of our UGI indicators did vary byethno-racial group and deprivation. Street tree density was higher inLSOAs with more Asian/Asian British households and which were moredeprived. In contrast, accessibility was better in LSOAs with a greaterproportion of White households and less deprived LSOA. The formerfinding contrasts with typical findings of environmental equity studiesas we find the minority ethno-racial population and more deprivedresidents better-served by this form of UGI. Additionally, it contraststhe findings of Landry and Chakraborty (2009) and Kuruneri-Chitepoand Shackleton (2011); two studies which deal specifically with theequitable distribution of street trees and which found that the less af-fluent residents, and the ethno-racial minority in the case of Landry andChakraborty (2009), were comparatively underserved.There are several underlying causes for the variation in our dis-tributions (Kendal et al., 2012; Landry & Chakraborty, 2009; Tookeet al., 2010). Street tree density is likely to be influenced by urban form(e.g. Pham, Apparicio, Landry, & Lewnard, 2017), such as the avail-ability of roadsides where trees can grow. Although we did not includeurban form in our analyses, one commonly used metric of urbanisation,population density, was strongly associated with our UGI indicators andprovided an influential control variable for our partial correlations.Ethnicity, deprivation and population density can often co-occur, sostudies that focus on why ethno-racial groups have poor access togreenspace increasingly incorporate how urban form and greenspacedistribution are inter-related (Wolch et al., 2010; McConnachie &Shacketon, 2010). Assessing characteristics of UGI against other in-dicators, including urban form, road and building density may allow agreater understanding of their distributions (Pham et al., 2017) and therelationship between ethno-racial groups and UGI.Across Bradford 65.6% of the city fell within 300m of a neigh-bourhood greenspace and thus met the ANGSt criteria. Although notdirectly comparable in terms of methods used, our finding contrastswith 36% of the area of Sheffield (Barbosa et al., 2007) and 10.3% ofLeicester (Comber et al., 2008) reported to meet ANGSt criteria. Thefigure for Bradford is, therefore, relatively high. However, given thataccessibility as measured by a physical distance which will not alwaysalign with perceptions of accessibility (Jones et al., 2009; Maroko et al.,2009), it may be that ANGSt criteria are themselves not a suitablemeasure, and a more nuanced approach to setting accessibility stan-dards (and compliance with those standards) is required (cf. Wilkinson,1985).Greenspace accessibility varied between ethno-racial groups andlevels of deprivation. However, for this UGI characteristic, we foundthat neighbourhoods with a high proportion of Asian/Asian Britishresidents and deprived households have less access to neighbourhoodgreenspaces than predominantly White, more affluent areas (cf. Booneet al., 2009; Shanahan et al., 2014; Wolch et al., 2013). Having accessto recreational neighbourhood greenspace is important, particularly forchildren and the disabled (McEachan et al., 2016; Peschardt et al.,2012), as research has also found that the beneficial effects of green-space may be stronger for those who actively use spaces (e.g. Bowler,Buyung-Ali, Knight, & Pullin, 2010). Our findings suggest that moredisadvantaged groups have less access to suitable neighbourhoodgreenspaces, which may serve to widen health inequalities (Dadvandet al., 2014). In order to redress this imbalance and ensure that allcommunities have access to greenspace in their local areas, urbanplanners could consider incorporating, the Natural England (2010), orequivalent, guidelines into their planning process. Ensuring adequateaccess to greenspace is a challenge in many dense urban areas due to alack of suitable space (Haaland & van den Bosch, 2015). Howevercreative solutions, which tailor spaces to the needs of the populace andutilise underused land, infrastructure or brownfield sites, which areoften abundant in post-industrial cities, can play a role in achievingthis.Greenspace quality was unrelated to household deprivation andhuman population density. However, ethno-racial disparities werepresent. Neighbourhoods characterised by White residents were nega-tively associated with greenspace quality with the converse true forAsian/Asian British neighbourhoods. When assessed spatially, we ob-served that the spatial distribution of greenspace quality was in-dependent from ethno-racial groups. Clusters of LSOAs with highquality greenspace provision occurred throughout the city regardless ofthe ethno-racial make-up of LSOAs (Fig. 6H,I). Nevertheless, the sig-nificant spatial clustering of greenspace quality (Fig. 5G,H,I) indicatedthat capturing quality should be an important part of any assessment ofgreenspace distribution and accessibility. For instance, across a range ofstudies and cities, despite a diversity of methods being employed, moredisadvantaged residents tend to have fewer greenspace amenities andhigher levels of incivilities, even if they do not have poorer access togreenspaces (Crawford et al., 2008; Hughey et al., 2016; Vaughan et al.,2013).Since the latter half of the 20th century, immigration to the UK hasbeen characterised by immigrants moving into low cost, densely po-pulated areas which typically lack open spaces (Conway et al., 2010;Pham et al., 2012; Tooke et al., 2010). As a community becomes moreestablished, this process may become self-perpetuating, with amenities,such as those based on community, society, religion or language, thatan immigrant would value contained within these densely populatedareas (Simpson, 2004). The inequality in greenspace accessibility thatwe report here may be a legacy of this process. Ethnic/racial groupsutilise greenspaces in different ways which are theorised to develop fora variety of reasons. For instance Byrne and Wolch (2009) suggestsexclusion/marginalization/discrimination or preferences developedthrough cultural heritage can help explain these differences. Our in-dicators of UGI distributions might, therefore, reflect differing methodsof utilisation among ethno-racial groups, although our empirical datadoes not allow us to distinguish amongst possible causes (Lyytimäki &Sipilä, 2009).Although evidence is limited in the UK, ethnic minorities are oftenoverlooked in their environmental needs. Indeed, many feel a sense ofexclusion from the countryside (Askins, 2009; Elvers et al., 2008) andinequitable access to urban green spaces may reinforce this (Comberet al., 2008). Hence in Bradford, the Asian/Asian British ethno-racialminority may not have integrated into neighbourhoods with betteraccess to greenspaces due either to a perception of exclusion or becausenearby UGI is not a priority when selecting places to live (Askins, 2009;Elvers et al., 2008).Similar processes may explain accessible greenspace distributionsrelating to household deprivation levels, as more deprived residents arepriced out from LSOAs with better access to public greenspaces(Conway et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2009; Pearce, 2003). Dadvand et al.(2014) found ethnic minority populations in Bradford were on averagemore deprived than White residents and they typically had worse accessto greenery. Therefore, the synergy between household deprivation andLSOAs with a majority Asian/Asian British population and their limitedaccess to neighbourhood greenspaces should come as no surprise. Lo-cally, these distributions show improving the equity of accessibility togreenspaces and, therefore, the liveability of the city, prioritising thenumber of small, nearby greenspaces would likely help mitigate healthinequalities to a greater extent than fewer, larger parks. The manypressures on, and demand for, space in urban areas makes this a chal-lenge, but the potential health and wellbeing gains are substantial andM. Ferguson et al. Landscape and Urban Planning 175 (2018) 136–148145should not be ignored in land-use decision-making processes (Mitchell& Popham, 2008; White et al., 2016).5. ConclusionAssessing a variety of UGI forms and characteristics revealed dif-ferent distributions in Bradford, further reinforcing the concept thatequity in UGI distribution is strongly context, and indicator specific(e.g. Barbosa et al., 2007; Comber et al., 2008; Jones, Brainard et al.,2009; Kessel et al., 2009). Contrasting findings are likely to be a resultof the forms and characteristics of UGI studied and the precise meth-odologies followed. For example in our assessment of greenspace ac-cessibility, we accounted for the countryside and found many less de-prived LSOAs on the outskirts of the city have sufficient access togreenspace via their proximity to the open countryside (c.f. Barbosaet al., 2007). Equally, given the generally higher coverage of privatelyowned UGI in less deprived areas (Shanahan et al., 2014; Tooke et al.,2010) our results would likely have been different if we had repeatedour analyses to include private greenspaces, such as domestic gardens.However, we deliberately focussed on publicly owned and accessibleUGI with the intention of assessing only UGI that was accessible to allresidents. Publically accessible urban green infrastructure offers theopportunity to provide needs-based provision to more deprived re-sidents, who will disproportionately benefit from it (Pham et al., 2012).We are still some way from fully understanding and quantifyinghow forms and characteristics of UGI vary among socio-economic andethno-racial groups. Doing this would require a national assessment ofUGI equity issues using a consistent multi-indicator methodology whichbroadens information used beyond that easily accessible through censusdata. Furthermore, to confirm the interpretation of the results andunderstand, rather than outline, the distributions, future research couldattempt to unpick causal relationships by making use of temporal data.This is key to tackling the issue, as in order to provide equitable accessto UGI, it is important that policy-makers understand what drives in-equitable distributions, perhaps helping to avoid counterproductiveprocesses such as gentrification that can arise from well-intentionedinterventions. Doing so remains a challenging proposition for such amultifaceted issue.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank James Brass and Tom Blackburn fromBradford Metropolitan District Council for providing urban green in-frastructure data.
