ABSTRACT: 
Increasing numbers of visitors are seeking out culinary experiences when travelling overseas. Food &#65532;can enhance the destination experience, giving physiological sustenance and providing opportunities to learn about destination cultures through direct encounters with local cuisines. However, engaging with novel local food might arouse certain visitor expectations, particularly among those who have not visited previously. This study aimed to identify international visitor preconceptions of local Indonesian food and the underlying factors influencing expectations prior to their in-country experi- ence of dining on local food. A questionnaire-based survey that was administered to 349 interna- tional visitors identified seven factors underlying their expectations: staff quality, sensory attributes, food uniqueness, local servicescapes, food authenticity, food familiarity, and food variety. A number of significantly different dining expectations were also highlighted between first-time and repeat visitors.

FULL TEXT: 
 Key words: Culinary tourism; Dining expectation; International visitors; Local Indonesian foodIntroductionFood constitutes an essential component of tour-ism, along with transportation, accommodation, and attractions. Visitors engage in various forms of din-ing during their travels (Chang, Kivela, & Mak, 2011), ranging from food that is familiar from home to seeking novel and different local dishes (Cohen & Avieli, 2004). The search for experiences with food that is emblematic of a destination has gained increasing attention among visitors. Food has evolved from a mechanism to fulfill physiological needs to a medium that enhances the destination experience, offering opportunities to learn about prevailing cultures through encountering local cuisines. Expe-riencing local foods is a gateway to new cultures, leading visitors to learn about the culture of societ-ies other than their own and to meet and engage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 2 WIJAYA ET AL.with locals (Hegarty & O’Mahony, 2001; Long, 2004). Because eating is integral to travel, it is com-monplace for visitors to expect pleasurable culi-nary experiences (Kivela & Crotts, 2006). Recent attempts to utilize culinary tourism as an attrac-tion have been evident in Asia, notably in leading tourism destinations such as Hong Kong (Kivela & Crotts, 2005; McKercher, Okumus, & Okumus, 2008; Okumus, Okumus, & McKercher, 2007), Singapore (Chaney & Ryan, 2012; Henderson, Yun, Poon, & Biwei, 2012), and Taiwan (Chaney & Ryan, 2012; Lin, Pearson, & Cai, 2011). It is appar-ent that these countries and territories reflect the tendency to extend culinary tourism as a means of stimulating international visitation (Horng, Liu, Chou, & Tsai, 2012).Despite the increased use of food as a tool for destination marketing, the literature shows that there has been little consensus about a single definition that describes food-related tourism. The terms food tourism, gastronomy tourism, and culinary tour­ism have been used interchangeably and scholars have described the various terms inconsistently (Karim & Chi, 2010). Hall and Mitchell (2001) defined food tourism as “visitation to primary and secondary food producers, food festivals, restau-rants and specific locations for which food and tasting and/or experiencing the attributes of a specialist food production region are the primary motivating factors for travel” (p. 308). Such a defi-nition implies that, when traveling, not every trip to a restaurant relates to food tourism, especially if the food eaten in the restaurant is the same as, or similar to, the food consumed at home. Meanwhile, Long (2004) defined culinary tourism as “the inten-tional, exploratory participation in the foodways of another—participation including the consumption, preparation, and presentation of a food item, cuisine, meal system, or eating style considered to belong to a culinary system not one’s own” (pp. 21–22). This definition suggests two meanings. First, it con-cerns visitors who are eager to discover novel food and to explore the new culture that connects with the food. This exploration relates to knowledge or information transfer about the people, culture, tra-ditions, and identity of the place visited. Second, culinary tourism is also about the host destinations that utilize food to showcase their cultures and histories, by making the food marketable and thus representing an attractive local identity for visitors (Long, 2004).Ignatov and Smith’s (2006) detailed definition of culinary tourism referred to a “tourism trip dur-ing which the purchase or consumption of regional foods (including beverages), or the observation and study of food production (from agriculture to cook-ing schools) represent a significant motivation or activity” (p. 238). In this sense, culinary tourism is more than just the simple consumption of food and drink when traveling, and also involves a self-aware interest and conscious learning to experience a destination through its food. Ignatov and Smith emphasized that food consumption is not necessar-ily the only or the primary activity on a culinary tourism trip. More importantly, experience forms the core of culinary tourism, with regionally pro-duced food and drink being used to tell a story or to portray some aspects of the culture of the region or country being visited. Culinary tourism is some-times viewed as a form of special interest tourism offering “real” travel. Recognized as part of cul-tural tourism, it provides real learning opportuni-ties by introducing visitors to the new and exciting smells, tastes, and flavors of local cultures (Ignatov & Smith, 2006). Based on the above discussion, the present study interprets culinary tourism as a trip during which the consumption or experience of local food and beverages is expressed in various food-related activities, regardless of whether expe-riencing local food is or is not a primary purpose for travel (Ignatov & Smith, 2006; Yun, Hennessey, & MacDonald, 2011).Tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors of Indonesia’s economy. In 2014, the country welcomed about 9.4 million international visitors, a growth rate of 7.19% over the figure for 2013 (Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of the Repub-lic of Indonesia, 2014). Data reported by the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy of the Repub-lic of Indonesia showed that visitors spent about 18%–20% of their total tourism consumption on food and beverages during 2010, ranked second in overall expenditures [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2012]. The cuisine of Indonesia is greatly influenced by natural conditions, culture, and history. For instance, food in Sumatra Island has been shaped by Indian and Chinese culture, ever since the island became 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 ENCOUNTERS WITH LOCAL FOOD IN INDONESIA 3a major trading route for these two countries. Most Northern Sumatra cities have been influenced by the way of life of Chinese and Indian immigrants (Ministry of Culture and Tourism, 2010). As the western anchor of the archipelago, Sumatra was the first port of call for Indian and Arab traders, and coastal Sumatrans adopted spices, stews, curries, and kebabs from these merchants (Koene, 1996). The cuisine of Sulawesi Island revolves around seafood, perhaps because the island is known for producing Indonesia’s best quality sea produce. One regional favorite is fish roasted over charcoal (ikan bakar) served with a variety of dipping sauces or condiments. Since the climate of East Nusa Tenggara (Timor) is dry, sago, corn, cassava, and taro are more commonplace as staple foods than rice (“Indonesian cuisine,” 2010).As a country with rich natural and cultural resources, Indonesia can potentially strengthen its international visitor appeal by focusing on culinary tourism. Indonesia is home to more than 485 ethnic groups and each has its own local food character-istics. This has endowed the national cuisine with variety and taste (Yurnaldi, 2010). There are thou-sands of local foods that can offer a strong focal point for portraying Indonesia as a tourism destina-tion. Indeed, it has led to uniqueness and a diversity of food-related activities that could be experienced by international visitors (Alamsyah, 2008). How-ever, establishing Indonesia’s position as a world-class food tourism destination remains a challenge. Having great diversity of traditional dishes may lead to difficulties when selecting particular foods for the international market (Pertiwi, 2011). During recent years, the government has been promoting Indonesian culinary diversity and richness to the international market. Culinary tourism has been pri-oritized for development as one of the seven types of special interest tourism. In 2012, the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy officially launched 30 signature traditional dishes of Indonesia aiming to improve awareness of Indonesian culinary diver-sity in the international market (Prawitasari, 2012). The national carrier, Garuda Indonesia, has also supported the promotion of Indonesian cuisine, through the Garuda Indonesia Experience con-cept that is designed to provide preflight, on-flight, and, after flight services characterized by Indo-nesian hospitality. This includes the provision of signature traditional dishes for on-board meals such as nasi kuning (Indonesian yellow rice), and nasi rendang (beef stewed with coconut paste) (https://www.garuda-indonesia.com/id/en/garuda-indonesia- experience/service-concept/index.page). In 2015, the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy desig-nated five cities as Indonesia’s gastronomy destina-tions: Bandung, Yogyakarta, Solo, Semarang and Bali (Widianto, 2015). A growing number of food-service establishments, ranging from small to large scale and from street food stalls to hotel restau-rants, are specializing in local Indonesian food and catering to both domestic and international visitors (Setyanti, 2011).The literature indicates that most of the culinary tourism studies that have examined visitor behav-iors were undertaken in more developed tourist des-tinations (Cohen & Avieli, 2004; Henderson, 2009). To the authors’ knowledge, no previous empirical studies have investigated food experiences involv-ing the consumption of local Indonesian food by international visitors. On this basis it is timely to conduct an empirical investigation in Indonesia, to examine how food culture differences can shape and affect the overall dining experiences with local food encountered by international visitors. In view of these shortcomings in the literature, the aims of the present study were:to discover international visitor preconceptions 1. of local Indonesian food;to examine the underlying factors influencing 2. international visitor expectations prior to engag-ing with local food dining in Indonesia;to test whether levels of dining expectation vary 3. significantly between first-time and repeat inter-national visitors to Indonesia.Literature ReviewInfluences on the Visitor Dining ExperienceAccording to Zeithaml and Bitner (2002), expec-tations are defined as customer desires or wants, particularly in the case of what they believe should be offered by service providers. In the tourism con-text, Fluker and Turner (2000) delineated expecta-tions as the perceived likelihood that a particular act would produce a particular outcome. Visitors make decisions based on certain expected outcomes and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 4 WIJAYA ET AL.their reactions to outcomes are partly influenced by their initial expectations (Dickson & Hall, 2006). Gnoth (1997) argued that it is important to man-age visitor expectations because this influences the visitor choice process and perceptions of the desti-nation experience. These in turn affect overall visi-tor satisfaction.Reviews of the relevant studies have indicated that most researchers investigating visitor dining experiences have primarily focused on three aspects: 1) food quality; 2) service quality; and 3) dining atmosphere (Antun, Frash, Costen, & Runyan, 2010; Chang, Kivela, & Mak, 2010; Chao, 2010; Yüksel, 2003). With respect to food quality, the lit-erature has highlighted a wide range of attributes to measure food quality. These vary from food pre-sentation or appearance, taste, food health-related characteristics, food quantity, and variety (Chao, 2010; Ha & Jang, 2010; Jang, Ha, & Silkes, 2009; Karim & Chi, 2010; Mak, Lumbers, & Eves, 2012; Namkung & Jang, 2007). Another influence on visitor dining expectations is service quality. The concept of service quality (SERVQUAL) is defined as the ability of service staff to perform tasks relat-ing to five dimensions: reliability, responsiveness, empathy, assurance, and tangibles (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, & Berry, 1988). Pendergast (2006) fur-ther highlighted that dining activities undertaken by international visitors at various dining establish-ments can stimulate feelings of involvement and place attachment, depending on the quality of food and service provision. Similarly, Sparks, Bowen, and Klag (2003) stated that both food and the phys-ical environment are showcases for culture and can shape dining expectations in order to connect with the host culture.Given the intensity of cultural interactions that are encountered by international visitors when din-ing on local food, it is imperative to incorporate food cultural-related aspects, such as food authen-ticity as factors that influence the dining expec-tation. Pratt (2007) explained that the concept of authenticity evokes a range of meanings such as original, genuine, real and true to itself. It relates to the quality attributed to a range of cuisines that are location specific. As revealed by Karim, Chua, and Salleh (2009), the food authenticity sought by for-eign travelers involved local ingredients used in the dishes, food taste, as well as unique cooking method and food presentation. Extending this perspective, Beer (2008) argued that authenticity might refer to the story and meaning pertaining to the place and culture of the food that is embedded as a represen-tation of the culture. For many travelers in vari-ous circumstances, it is background stories, such as the origins of a particular ethnic food, that may appeal more than the food itself (Morgan, Watson, & Hemmington, 2008).The literature has also recognized the associa-tion between previous visitor experiences and the intention to consume local food in the destination (Kwun & Oh, 2006; Ryu & Han, 2010; Ryu & Jang, 2006). Kwun and Oh (2006) asserted that past expe-rience strongly affects future consumption-related expectations for the same experience. Moreover, they note that experienced consumers form their expectations differently relative to first-time con-sumers, even for the same products. This is due to their greater familiarity with and knowledge about the local product. Similarly, Seo, Kim, Oh, and Yun (2013) affirmed that having more experiences with local food can increase visitors’ familiarity.Research MethodA questionnaire-based survey was administered to a total of 349 international visitors to Indone-sia. They were asked: 1) basic profiles relating to demographics and travel characteristics; 2) precon-ceptions or knowledge about local Indonesian food (open-ended questions); 3) attributes that were important to be expected prior to actual dining expe-riences with local Indonesian food (using a 5-point Likert scale). Given that the examination of dining expectations was undertaken while the respondents were in Indonesia, the term local food in this study refers to all local Indonesian food offered at any type of food establishment with which the visitors might engage during their trip. In most cases the participants were approached at Juanda Interna-tional Airport Surabaya, East Java at the arrivals terminal, and in the lobbies of four- and five-star hotels in Surabaya and Malang, East Java. Consid-ering the limitations of examining visitor expecta-tions retrospectively, Wijaya, King, Nguyen, and Morrison (2013) proposed that the measurement of visitor dining expectations is better conducted prior to actual visitor encounters with local food 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 ENCOUNTERS WITH LOCAL FOOD IN INDONESIA 5consumption in the destination. That is, the mea-surement of dining expectations was undertaken before the visitor’s actual encounter with local food consumption during their current visit. This process is crucial for ensuring that visitor responses about their dining expectations with local food are free of bias from their perceptions about the actual din-ing activity. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was applied to identify the underlying external fac-tors that influenced visitor dining expectations. In addition, MANOVA analysis was undertaken to ascertain whether there were significantly different dining expectation levels between first-time and repeat visitors to Indonesia.FindingsParticipant ProfilesIn terms of the respondent demographics, out of 349 participants there were 196 males. Most were aged 30 or above and were from European coun-tries. A majority were working, and had attained their highest education level minimum at diploma or bachelor degree level. With regard to purpose of travel to Indonesia, most of the participants were visiting Indonesia for holidays. There was a fairly equal proportion traveling for education/cultural exchange and for business/MICE. A majority were visiting Indonesia for the first time (221 out of 349); most were spending more than a week for travel, and the majority were traveling with a group.Preconceptions of Local Indonesian FoodAlthough most participants stated that they were visiting Indonesia for the first time, a majority (275 out of 349) had heard about local Indonesian food prior to visiting. It is more likely that respondents received information pertaining to local Indonesian food by word of mouth (WOM) from friends, fam-ily, or relatives, rather than though written sources like magazines or newspaper articles about Indo-nesian cuisines. The authors examined participant preconceptions on the basis of their knowledge about the most salient characteristics of local Indo-nesian food. The related findings are illustrated in the form of tag clouds in Figure 1. The words in the tag cloud with larger fonts are indicative of more frequent mentions by the participants.As seen in Figure 1, rice­based, spicy, tasty, sweet, mostly fried (similar to oily), herbs spices, sambal, and halal were the words most frequently associated with local Indonesian cuisine. The first four words—rice­based, spicy, tasty, sweet—relate to food taste, while herbs spices and sambal refer to the ingredients used in the dishes. Moreover, mostly fried (oily) was the characteristic concerned with the way of cooking the food. Interestingly, participants’ identification of major characteristics also revealed Figure 1. The characteristics of local Indonesian food. Respondents’ most frequently occurring descriptions.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 6 WIJAYA ET AL.that local Indonesian food was preconceived as halal. Given that Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world, the cuisines throughout the country should follow the beliefs of the Muslim religion; that is, they are free of nonhalal ingredi-ents, such as pork. These findings pose important implications as to how culinary tourism in Indone-sia could be promoted through the appropriate por-trayal of food images to international visitors.Important Expected Factors Prior to Dining With Local Indonesian FoodTo determine the dimensionality of the dining expectation scale, 23 dining-related items were extracted using EFA applying the Varimax rotation method. The results of the KMO measure of sam-pling adequacy revealed a value of 0.799, which was larger than the minimum cut-off point of 0.60. Bartlett’s test of sphericity illustrated significance at a level of 0.000 [c2(253) = 1.783E3]. As for the dimensionality of the scale assessing visitor dining expectations of local food, 59.24% of the total vari-ance emerged from the analysis. This provides an indication that more than half of the variance can be explained by the solution of factor analysis, gen-erating seven distinct factors. All newly extracted factors have Cronbach’s alpha coefficients above 0.50; thus, they meet the minimum cut-off point as required (25). The seven extracted factors and the corresponding indicators or variables from EFA (Table 1) were found to be the following.Table 1Summary of EFA of Local Food Dining ExpectationsFactor NameFactor Loadings Eigenvalue Variance (%) ReliabilityFactor 1.

Factor 1 contains five items: communicative staff, knowledgeable staff, responsive staff, friendly staff, and good descrip-tion of dishes. This factor had the highest eigen-value (4.977), 21.64% of the total variance, and a high reliability coefficient of Cronbach’s alpha that equaled 0.72. The factor was labeled staff qual-ity because it displayed a predominance of items that were associated with the competence of the dining staff. It was reasonable to expect adequate assistance from the staff during the experience of dining on local food, given that they were part of the local community with whom the partici-pants were keen to interact. Additionally, partici-pants were international visitors who might be unfamiliar with Indonesian food. As such, expect-ing good service from local staff was understand-able as it was considered an important element in enhancing the quality of the dining experience with local food.Factor 2: Sensory Appeal. Factor 2 had an eigen-value of 2.124, accounting for 9.24% of the total variance, and a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.74. It was articulated by five items related to: food smells appealing, clean dining place, the use of fresh ingredients, food tastes good, and a pleasant ambi-ence. All are indicative of dining expectations pro-voked by human senses. In light of this, the factor was named sensory appeal. The emergence of this factor was thought provoking because the sensory appeal factor was extracted not merely by food- related elements, such as taste, smell, and fresh-ness of the food. It was also determined by sensory appeal concerning the cleanliness and pleasant ambience of the dining establishment where the food consumption took place.Factor 3: Food Uniqueness. Factor 3 showed an eigenvalue of 1.734, explaining 7.54% of the total variance, and a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.64. Impor-tant among the items connected with this factor were: unique way of cooking the food, unique way of eating the food, and unique way of presenting the food. The food uniqueness factor is a reflection of Indonesian’s unique way of preparing, serving, presenting, and eating the food.Factor 4: Local Servicescapes. Factor 4 was interpreted as the local servicescapes factor com-prising three items: dining place is representative of local culture, unique local décor, and dining place provides a welcoming sense of local culture. Unlike the food uniqueness factor, which put more empha-sis on the food aspect, the three items extracted from the local servicescapes factor were closely associ-ated with the physical aspect of dining, specifically reflecting the local culture. This factor obtained an eigenvalue of 1.348, described 5.86% of the total variance, and had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.70. According to Gibbs and Ritchie (2010), the provi-sion of memorable food experiences during travel cannot be separated from the quality of food ser-vice establishments. Bitner (1992) described that servicescape comprises three dimensions: ambient conditions; spatial layout and functionality; and signs, symbols, and artefacts. In this study, local servicescapes were found to be closely associated with the physical aspect of dining representing local Indonesian culture. These aspects included: the unique design, décor, and layout of the din-ing establishment; how the place reflected local Indonesian culture (e.g., through traditional music played); and how it provided a sense of welcome to visitors. Such findings suggest the important role of this factor as the first “moment-of-truth” of the ser-vices encountered by the visitors, prior to the actual engagement with the local food itself.Factor 5: Food Authenticity. Factor 5 had an eigenvalue of 1.238, explained 5.38% of the total variance, and had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.60. This factor emerged from the correlations of three items: authentic taste, authentically spicy, and exotic food, demonstrating a close link with the authenticity aspect. Food authenticity was the fifth external fac-tor found to significantly contribute to shaping par-ticipant dining expectations. It is important to note that this result was in accordance with the precon-ceptions that the participants had (Fig. 1) regarding the major characteristics of Indonesian cuisines that they were required to describe at the beginning of the survey. Most of these initial descriptions were related to the taste of local Indonesian food, which was perceived as spicy, containing lot of herbs and spices, and authentic.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 8 WIJAYA ET AL.Factor 6: Food Familiarity. Factor 6 had an eigenvalue of 1.196, accounting for 5.20% of the total variance, and showed a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.56. There were two items contributing to the emergence of this factor: flavor modified for taste and the use of familiar ingredients. The appearance of this factor in this study was notable, given that food authenticity, as discussed above, also emerged as a significant expected factor. Despite projecting expectations of seeking authenticity in the food, the participants nevertheless expected some familiarity with the local food they intended to eat. Here this constituted participant familiarity with food ingre-dients that were known, as well as a degree of flavor modification in the local dishes they wanted to eat. These findings imply that whereas visitors travel in search of novelty and strangeness, most need a degree of familiarity to enjoy their experience. The new factor of food familiarity that emerged from factor analysis in this research was evidence that this factor affects expectations involving dining on local food.Factor 7: Food Variety. Factor 7 emerged as last factor from the analysis. This factor emerged from the correlation of two items: local drink in the destination, and wide range of food available. This factor had an eigenvalue of 1.009, explain-ing 4.39% of the total variance, and exhibited a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.51. It is noteworthy to discover that the expectations concerning vari-ety were not exclusively related to local food, but also involved the presence of various options for local beverages.In addition to these seven underlying factors and as is illustrated in Table 2, the MANOVA analysis indicates the influence of frequency of visit on din-ing expectations.The Wilk’s lambda of 0.894, the F value of 2.567, and the p value of 0.001 showed a statistically sig-nificant difference among respondents who trav-eled to Indonesia for the first time, 2–3 times, and more than 3 times in terms of their overall dining expectations. In other words, a significant effect of the frequency of visit attribute was found on the visitor’s dining expectation. Specifically, out of seven dining expectation factors, two dependent variables—food authenticity and food familiarity—recorded a significant value less than the cut-off of 0.05. With regards to food familiarity, and as illus-trated in Table 2, participants who stated that they were visiting Indonesia for the first time expressed higher expectations (mean = 3.13) than those who had previously traveled to the country 2–3 times (mean = 2.70). In the context of this study, food familiarity pertains to the ingredients used and to the flavor of the food. Therefore, it is unsurpris-ing to find that those who traveled to Indonesia for the first time expected to encounter food that was more familiar to them, compared with those who had visited Indonesia previously (assuming that they had previous dining experience with local Indonesian food). By contrast, in terms of food authenticity, those who had traveled previously to Table 2Summary of MANOVA Analysis Based on Respondent Frequencies of TravelFrequency of VisitFactors Influencing Dining ExpectationsFirst-Time Visit2–3 Times VisitMore Than 3 Times Visit p Value1.

This finding is reasonable, given the assumption that those who had traveled to Indonesia might have experienced dining on local Indonesian food during their previous visit, which in turn would build their conception about how the delivery of authentic traditional Indone-sian cuisine.DiscussionThis study revealed seven external factors affect-ing participant expectations about local Indonesian food prior to the actual dining experience. Pre-sented in order of importance, these seven factors were: staff quality, sensory appeal, food unique-ness, local servicescapes, food authenticity, food familiarity, and food variety. Each is now discussed in detail.Staff quality appeared to be the most important factor anticipated by participants. In this study, staff quality comprised the attributes relating to the abil-ity of local staff to provide adequate information about local food, to offer responsive and friendly services, as well as to communicate well with the participants. It was reasonable to expect adequate assistance from the staff during the experience of dining on local food, given that they were part of the local community with whom the participants were keen to interact. Additionally, participants were international visitors who might not be famil-iar with Indonesian food. As such, expecting good service from local staff was understandable as it was considered an important element in enhanc-ing the quality of the dining experience with local food. The importance of this aspect was also con-firmed by Gibbs and Ritchie (2010), who stated that besides the food that is being consumed at dining establishments, staff capacity in providing services to customers is also a key determinant in providing memorable dining experiences.Sensory appeal was found to be the second most important factor anticipated by participants prior to dining, indicative of dining expectations stimulated by human senses. The emergence of this factor in the research was thought provoking since the sensory appeal factor was not exclusively extracted by food-related elements, such as taste, smell, and freshness of the food. It was also deter-mined by the cleanliness and pleasant ambience of the dining establishment where the food consump-tion occurred. This evidence suggests that, in din-ing, the role of items beyond food are considered by international visitors as being just as essential as the food itself and, as such, should not be over-looked by relevant tourism authorities. Kivela and Crotts (2006) noted that dining experiences should offer a pleasurable sensory experience because they involve stimuli from the food that is seen, smelt, tasted, touched, and felt. The results of this study confirm this belief. It has been found that sensory appeal plays a critical role in motivating partici-pants to try the local food, even if they were unfa-miliar with it beforehand.Food uniqueness was the third factor contribut-ing to participant dining expectations, including ways of cooking, presenting, and eating local food in ways that were considered different from what they experienced at home. In other words, the food uniqueness factor in this study reflects Indonesian’s unique way of preparing, serving, presenting, and eating the food. As found in Jang et al.’s study (2009), the food uniqueness factor was represented by sensory-related aspects, such as being exotic, spicy, and aromatic. However, the findings of this study revealed that the unique aspect of local cui-sines composed of elements of food quality outside of the sensory appeal attributes. As described in the preceding paragraph, sensory appeal emerged as a distinct factor with a significant influence on par-ticipant expectations.According to Smith, Costello, and Muenchen (2010), the provision of memorable food experi-ences during travel cannot be separated from the quality of food service establishments. In this study the local servicescape was found to be a significant external factor affecting participant dining expec-tations with local Indonesian food. Local servic-escapes were closely associated with the physical aspect of dining representing local Indonesian cul-ture. These aspects included: the unique design, décor, and layout of the dining establishment; how the place reflected local Indonesian culture (e.g., through traditional music played); and how it pro-vided a sense of welcome to visitors. The results suggest that the important role of this factor was the first “moment-of-truth” of the services encountered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 10 WIJAYA ET AL.by the visitors, prior to the actual engagement with the local food itself.Food authenticity was the fifth external factor found to contribute significantly to shaping partici-pant dining expectations. The emergence of food authenticity as a distinct extracted factor incor-porated: the authentic taste of the food; authentic spiciness of the food; and any local dishes that the diners found to be exotic. It is important to note that this result was in accordance with the preconcep-tions that the participants had regarding the major characteristics of Indonesian cuisines that they were required to describe at the beginning of the survey. As was discussed previously, most of these initial descriptions relate to the taste of local Indonesian food, which was perceived as spicy, containing lot of herbs and spices, and authentic (see Fig. 1).Along with authenticity, food familiarity was the sixth important factor significantly influencing par-ticipant dining expectations. The appearance of this factor in the present study was notable, given that food authenticity, as discussed above, also emerged as a significant expected factor. Despite projecting expectations of seeking authenticity in the food, the participants nevertheless expected some familiarity with the local food they intended to eat. Here this constituted participant familiarity with food ingre-dients that were known, as well as a degree of flavor modification in the local dishes they wanted to eat. These findings imply that whereas visitors travel in search of novelty and strangeness, most need a degree of familiarity to enjoy their experience. The emergence of food familiarity that emerged from the factor analysis was evidence of its influence on expectations involving dining on local food.Food variety was the last factor significantly affecting participant expectations. It encompassed two items: the wide range of local dishes that cater to participant preferences or needs; and the avail-ability of local Indonesian beverages that partici-pants might want to experience. It is noteworthy that expectations concerning variety were not exclu-sively related to local food, but also involved the presence of various options for local beverages.This study also revealed that frequency of visit to Indonesia had a significant influence on partici-pant dining expectations. Differences were identi-fied between the groups with regard to the expected level of two factors: food familiarity and food authenticity. First-timers expressed higher expec-tations of familiarity with local food than repeat visitors. By contrast, in terms of food authentic-ity, repeat visitors projected significantly higher expectations concerning food authenticity than first-timers. This finding is reasonable, given the assumption that repeat visitors to Indonesia may have dined on local Indonesian food during their previous visits. This would, in turn, help build their conception about how authentic traditional Indo-nesian culinary should be delivered. This finding accords with Kwun and Oh (2006), who concluded that past experience affects future consumption-related expectations for the same experience. They note that experienced consumers form their expec-tations differently than first-timers, even for the same products. This is due to their greater familiar-ity and level of knowledge about the local product.Conclusions and RecommendationsWith respect to the geographical context, this study has enriched the body of hospitality manage-ment literature by providing a better understanding of culinary tourism in Indonesia, one of Southeast Asia’s emerging tourism destinations. This is note-worthy as the existing literature has been mainly concerned with the culinary tourism offerings in Western and more developed destinations. There-fore, this study provides a space for academic dis-cussions related to culinary tourism from the Asian perspective. The results show seven underlying factors that affect participant dining expectations with local Indonesian food: staff quality; sensory appeal; food uniqueness; local servicescapes; food familiarity; food authenticity; and food variety fac-tors. In terms of frequency of travel, the finding shows significant differences between first time and repeater travelers in expecting food authentic­ity and food familiarity factors.As an exploratory study, this research has offered a practical contribution to Indonesia’s tourism indus-try to the improved understanding of international visitor dining behavior. It is anticipated that the findings will assist relevant stakeholders to design their culinary tourism strategies on a market-driven basis. Foodservice providers in Indonesia need to be aware of these facts and attempt to accommo-date different dining expectations when catering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 ENCOUNTERS WITH LOCAL FOOD IN INDONESIA 11to international visitors. This could be done, for instance, by providing options for the food spici-ness level because not all international visitors can accept spicy food, especially those who are travel-ing to Indonesia and experiencing the local food for the first time. Furthermore, because staff service quality and food cultural-related factors appeared to be dominant in shaping local food dining expec-tation, it is important for relevant Indonesian gov-ernment bodies like the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy to support the industry with adequate training such as language and communi-cations in cross-cultural contexts.Despite this study’s significant contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, due to resource constraints, the empirical investiga-tion was only conducted in the geographical scope of Surabaya and Malang cities in East Java prov-ince, thereby leading to possible bias because of the cultural setting. On this basis, the study does not claim to represent the whole of Indonesia with its diverse food cultures. Accordingly, this research should not be interpreted as being representative of the general experiential examination on dining with all local Indonesian food. It is therefore rec-ommended that future studies should be conducted in other destination contexts and/or in other cultural settings. Second, in terms of the sample represen-tativeness, the number of participants from Asian countries was less than those residing in non-Asian countries. As a consequence, although a total of 349 international visitors participated in this study, the number was still relatively small. If the research-ers were to conduct a comprehensive group compar-ison on the basis of sociodemographics and travel characteristics, a larger and more representative sam-ple would be required. For instance, visitors origi-nating from within the Southeast Asian region may have different expectations to those from the West. Therefore, to enhance reliability and the validity of the data, it is recommended that a larger and more heterogeneous sample size should be considered.ReferencesAlamsyah, Y. (2008).
