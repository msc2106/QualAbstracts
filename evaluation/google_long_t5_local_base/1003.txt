ABSTRACT: 
The development of a distributed source model to predict fan tone noise levels of an installed turbofan aero-engine is reported. The key objective is to examine a canonical problem: how to predict the pressure field due to a distributed source located near an infinite, rigid cylinder. This canonical problem is a simple representation of an installed turbofan, where the distributed source is based on the pressure pattern generated by a spinning duct mode, and the rigid cylinder represents an aircraft fuselage. The radiation of fan tones can be modelled in terms of spinning modes. In this analysis, based on duct modes, theoretical expressions for the near-field acoustic pressures on the cylinder, or at the same locations without the cylinder, have been formulated. Simulations of the near-field acoustic pressures are compared against measurements obtained from a fan rig test. Also, the installation effect is quantified by calculating the difference in the sound pressure levels with and without the adjacent cylindrical fuselage. Results are shown for the blade passing frequency fan tone radiated at a supersonic fan operating conditio.

 Near-field sound radiation of fan tones from an installed turbofan aero-engineAlan McAlpine, James Gaffney, and Michael J. KinganInstitute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton, Southampton, Hampshire SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom(Dated: 9 July 2015)The development of a distributed source model to predict fan tone noise levels of an installed turbofan aero-engine is reported. The key objective is to examine a canonical problem: how to predict the pressure field due toa distributed source located near an infinite, rigid cylinder. This canonical problem is a simple representation ofan installed turbofan, where the distributed source is based on the pressure pattern generated by a spinning ductmode, and the rigid cylinder represents an aircraft fuselage. The radiation of fan tones can be modelled in termsof spinning modes. In this analysis, based on duct modes, theoretical expressions for the near-field acousticpressures on the cylinder, or at the same locations without the cylinder, have been formulated. Simulationsof the near-field acoustic pressures are compared against measurements obtained from a fan rig test. Also theinstallation effect is quantified by calculating the difference in the sound pressure levels with and without theadjacent cylindrical fuselage. Results are shown for the blade passing frequency fan tone radiated at a supersonicfan operating condition.PACS numbers:I. INTRODUCTIONFan tones are a key noise source from turbofan aero-engines. Advanced theoretical and numerical methods to pre-dict fan tones are routinely used by industry. Noise generatedby the ducted fan in a turbofan engine is often described interms of duct modes. Calculations of modes can be used topredict the in-duct sound propagation, and the sound radiationfrom the duct, albeit the majority of theoretical and numericalschemes predict the sound radiated into free space. Fewerschemes include installation acoustics in their modelling, thatis how the radiated sound field is altered when the source, i.e.the aircraft engine, is installed on an aeroplane. In this arti-cle, the relevance of the work is directly linked to the issue ofcabin noise in turbofan aircraft, specifically on the predictionof the sound pressure levels on the fuselage due to fan tones.The key objective of this work is to formulate a canoni-cal problem in order to study near-field installation acoustics.The basic set-up is shown sketched in Fig. 1. The objectiveis to predict the pressure on the surface of a rigid, cylindricalfuselage adjacent to a nearby distributed sound source. Thedistributed source is based on the pressure pattern generatedby a spinning mode in a cylindrical duct. This is used to modela tone generated by a ducted fan. The prediction method willbe used to evaluate the sound pressure levels on the surface ofa cylindrical fuselage owing to specific rotor-alone tones gen-erated by a supersonic ducted fan. These tones are harmonicsof the engine’s shaft rotation frequency and are the major con-tributor to what is known as the “buzz-saw” noise.A simple modelling approach is proposed in order to pre-dict the acoustic pressure in the near field. The predictions arebased on calculating the radiation of a spinning mode froma cylindrical duct. A convenient approach in this case is theRayleigh integral formulation, originally used by Tyler andSofrin1. The Rayleigh integral is formulated by integratinginfinitesimal volume sources located on the duct termination.The source strength of the volume sources (volume velocity)is proportional to the axial particle velocity at the duct termi-nation. The Rayleigh integral can be used with a non-uniformvelocity distribution across the duct termination, so the radi-zxy___acoustic discsourcerigid, infinitecylinder(a)(b)FIG. 1. (a) Sketch of an installed turbofan aero-engine. (b) Canon-ical problem for fan tone radiation from an installed turbofan aero-engine.ation of spinning modes can be calculated, including takingaccount of clockwise or counter-clockwise spinning modes.It is appropriate to only use the Rayleigh integral to cal-culate the sound radiation in the forward hemisphere. It isknown that with an unflanged duct the predicted pressure fieldwill not be realistic near sideline (polar angle equal to 90◦).Hoctor2 compared the directivity patterns for spinning modesradiated from a cylindrical duct, calculated using the Wiener–Hopf technique (unflanged duct) and using the Rayleigh in-tegral approach. He found that for practical applications theagreement between the two methods was good, at least up topolar angles around 70◦.Although the Rayleigh integral can be used to calculatethe radiation of spinning modes from a cylindrical duct, it isnot straightforward to include the effect of having a cylindri-cal fuselage in the near field. The approach used here is tocombine the Rayleigh integral formulation with the theoret-ical solution for the pressure on a cylinder’s surface due to1a monopole point source located near the cylinder. In theabsence of mean flow, the generic solution to this canoni-cal problem is detailed in the text on Electromagnetic andAcoustic Scattering by Simple Shapes by Bowman, Seniorand Uslenghi3, published in 1969. In the context of the air-craft interior noise problem, Fuller4 has investigated sphericalacoustic waves impinging on a cylinder, and in this referencethe pressure field on the cylinder’s surface due to a monopolesource is detailed.This article is a continuation of the work in McAlpine andKingan5 which examined open rotors and installation acous-tics effects in the far field. The methodology in this new articleis similar, but now the pressure is calculated in the near field,specifically on the surface of an adjacent cylindrical fuselage,and the source is a fan tone generated by a ducted fan, insteadof a tone generated by an open rotor. In Ref. 5 there is a reviewof previous work on this type of installation acoustics prob-lem. The key relevant previous work is the procedure outlinedin Hanson and Magliozzi6. In Ref.6 the incident field due toa propeller noise source in free space is used to determinethe total field in the presence of an aircraft fuselage which ismodelled by an infinite, rigid cylinder. The incident field isgiven by near-field frequency-domain propeller source theorydeveloped previously by Hanson. This solution was derivedin a coordinate system centred on the propeller. In Ref. 6 theauthors show how to shift the solution to a coordinate sys-tem which is centred on the axis of the cylinder, using Graf’sAddition theorem. They then combine this with an appropri-ate form of the scattered field (a sum of outward propagatingcylindrical waves): the resultant sum of the incident and scat-tered fields gives the total pressure field. Their analysis alsoincludes the effect of the fuselage boundary layer, and theymatch their analytical solutions to a numerical solution in theboundary layer.The methodology used in the present work is essentially thesame as that proposed by Hanson and Magliozzi, albeit thetonal source is from a ducted fan rather than a propeller, andthe analysis does not include the fuselage boundary layer. Thekey step in Hanson and Magliozzi is transforming the cylin-drical polar coordinate system, moving the origin from thecentre of the source to the centre of the fuselage. These twocoordinate systems are shown sketched in Fig. 2.A field point can be defined in terms of the cylindrical polarcoordinate system, (r, φ, z), centred on the distributed source,or alternatively, in terms of the cylindrical polar coordinatesystem,(r¯, φ¯, z¯), centred on the cylindrical fuselage. Thesetwo coordinate systems are used in the mathematical formula-tion which is outlined in §II. The theory is followed by valida-tion results in §III, and a selection of illustrative results basedon a realistic model-scale test case in §IV.II. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATIONConsider a rigid duct, radius a. Field points inside theduct are specified by the cylindrical polar coordinate system(r, φ, z), where the z-axis is aligned with the duct centreline.The duct has an unflanged termination at z = 0. Also in-side and outside the duct there is a subsonic uniform meanflow, Mach number Mz = Uz/c0, directed in the negativez-direction.rrb__aa0 DistributedsourceCylindricalfuselagexyzx_y_z_PFIG. 2. Sketch of reference frames for the source and the cylinder.A. In-duct sound fieldThe in-duct sound field is represented in terms of ‘spin-ning modes’. Mode (l, q) has azimuthal order l and ra-dial order q. Assuming time-harmonic waves, solving theconvected Helmholtz equation, the acoustic pressure p ′lq =p̂lq (r, φ, z) exp {iω0t} and axial particle velocity uz lq =ûz lq (r, φ, z) exp {iω0t} of mode (l, q) are given byp̂lq = Plq Jl (κlqr) ei(−lφ−kzlqz) , (1)ûz lq =ξlqρ0c0Plq Jl (κlqr) ei(−lφ−kzlqz) , (2)where Plq is the modal amplitude,ξlq =kzlq(k0 + kzlq Mz) , (3)and the dispersion relation is given bykz2lq + κ2lq =(k0 + kzlq Mz)2, k0 = ω0/c0 > 0 . (4)Also Jl (·) denotes the Bessel function of the first kind orderl, {κlq : q = 1, 2, 3, . . .} is the set of radial eigenvalues whichsatisfy J′l (κlqa) = 0 (which determines for given azimuthalorder l the radial modes of order q in a rigid-walled duct ofradius a), kzlq is the axial wavenumber of mode (l, q), c0 isthe speed of sound, and ρ0 is the mean density of the fluid(air) inside the duct. Also, the modal sound power W lq isproportional to the square of the modal amplitude, i.e.Wlq =|Plq|22ρ0c0π[a2 −(lκlq)2 ]J2l (κlqa)×[(1 +M2z)Re {ξlq} −Mz(1 + |ξlq|2)]. (5)B. Incident fieldThe acoustic pressure owing to a fan tone radiated from theduct is termed the incident field p′i. This field is determined by2xy 0123N - 1aN - 2N - 3FIG. 3. Sketch of ring source at the duct termination.integrating a distribution of monopole sources over the cross-section of the duct termination. This neglects the effect ofdiffraction by the edge of the duct.First consider an annular ring source, comprised of Nmonopoles distributed evenly around a circle of radius η. Thepoint sources are numbered, s = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N−1. Monopoles is located at (r, φ, z) = (η, sΔψ, 0), where Δψ = 2π/N .The annular ring source at the duct termination is shownsketched in Fig. 3.A derivation of the incident pressure field owing to a rotat-ing point source with angular velocity Ω, centred at the originand moving in the plane z = 0, in the presence of subsonicuniform mean flow directed in the negative z-direction, is de-tailed in McAlpine and Kingan5. Equations (20–22) in Ref.5give the incident field for a rotating monopole source. Onsetting Ω = 0, the field for a stationary point source is re-covered. Accordingly, the pressure field owing to monopolesource s = 0 is given byp′ (0)i (r, φ, z, t) =1(2π)2∞∑m=−∞{(∫ ∞−∞p′ (0)ime−ikzz dkz)e−imφ}, (6)wherep′ (0)im(r, kz, t) =π2Q(0)ρ0c0 (k0 + kzMz)×H(2)m (Γ0 r>) Jm (Γ0 r<) eiω0t , (7)and the overbar is used to denote a variable which has beenFourier transformed.The volume velocity of the monopole source is given byQ(0) exp {iω0t}.

Relationship between the axial wavenumber kz and the ‘ra-dial’ wavenumber Γ0.Also the ‘radial’ wavenumber Γ0 is given byΓ02 = (k0 + kzMz)2 − k2z . (10)In order to ensure that only outward propagating waves areallowed as r → ∞, the appropriate values of Γ0, as a functionof kz , are shown in Fig. 4. In the range,−k01 +Mz< kz <k01−Mz , (11)Γ0 is real, whilst outside this range Γ0 = −iγ0 where γ0 =√k2z − (k0 + kzMz)2 > 0.Introduce the new angular coordinate φ˜ such that pointsource s is located at φ˜ = 0. Thenφ˜ = φ− sΔψ , (12)and from Equations (6,7)p′ (s)i (r, φ, z, t) =1(2π)2∞∑m=−∞{(∫ ∞−∞p′ (s)ime−ikzz dkz)e−imφ˜}, (13)=Q(s)ρ0c08π∞∑m=−∞{(∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) H(2)m (Γ0 r>)×Jm (Γ0 r<) e−ikzz dkz)×e−im(φ−sΔψ) eiω0t}. (14)The source strength Q(s) is specified by taking the ax-ial particle velocity of spinning mode (l, q) at (r, φ, z) =(η, sΔψ, 0). From Equation (2)Q(s) = ûz lq (η, sΔψ, 0) δA , (15)=ξlq Plqρ0c0Jl (κlqη) e−ilsΔψ δA , (16)where δA = η δη δψ.The total incident field is given byp′i (r, φ, z, t) =N−1∑s=0p′ (s)i (r, φ, z, t) . (17)Thus, combining Equations (14), (16) and (17) givesp′i (r, φ, z, t) =ξlq Plq8πN−1∑s=0∞∑m=−∞{3( ∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) H(2)m (Γ0 r>)×Jm (Γ0 r<) Jl (κlqη) e−ikzz dkz)×e−i(l−m)sΔψ e−imφ eiω0t η δη δψ}. (18)The summation over s can be found using the standard for-mula for a geometric progression. The summation is zero un-less m = l − nN where n is an integer. Hence Equation (18)reduces top′i (r, φ, z, t) = Nξlq Plq8π∞∑n=−∞{( ∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) H(2)l−nN (Γ0 r>)×Jl−nN (Γ0 r<) Jl (κlqη) e−ikzz dkz)×einNφ e−ilφ eiω0t η δη δψ}. (19)Each ring source contains N point sources. The distributedsource is formed by taking the limit as N → ∞, then Nδψ →2π and only the term n = 0 is required in the summation, andalso taking the limit as δη → 0 and integrating from η = 0to a. This gives, at field points outside the duct terminationr > a,p′i (r, φ, z, t) =ξlq Plq4∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) Ψlq ×H(2)l (Γ0 r) e−ikzz dkz e−ilφ eiω0t , (20)whereΨlq =∫ aη=0Jl (Γ0 η) Jl (κlqη) η dη .

(23)Graf’s Addition theorem is listed by Abramowitz and Ste-gun7. Given the triangle shown sketched in Fig. 5, with sidesof length u, v and w, and angles α (between sides u and v)and χ (between sides u and w), then the theorem states thatζm(w)eimχ =∞∑n=−∞ζm+n(u)Jn(v)einα , (24)where ζm denotes any of the Bessel functions Jm, Ym, H(1)m ,H(2)m , or linear combinations thereof. If the variables are com-plex, it is also required that |ve±iα| < |u|, unless ζm = Jm.Graf’s Addition theorem is now used to transform the inci-dent field to the cylindrical polar coordinate system (r¯, φ¯, z¯)centred on the cylindrical fuselage as shown in Fig. 2. It isemphasised that the cylinder has not yet been included in theuvwFIG. 5. Graf’s Addition theorem.modelling. At this step in the analysis, the aim is to findthe incident pressure field at r¯ = a0, which will be the lo-cation of the surface of the cylinder (when it is included inthe subsequent analysis). Graf’s addition theorem can be usedfor transforming between the coordinate systems (r, φ, z) and(r¯, φ¯, z¯).Specifically, at the field point r > a and r¯ < b, set u = Γ0b,v = Γ0r¯, w = Γ0r, α = φ¯− β and χ = π+ β − φ. Note thatr¯ < b ⇒ |v| < |u| (as α is real). Then direct application ofGraf’s Addition theorem leads toH(2)l (Γ0r) e−ilφ =∞∑n=−∞{(−1)(l+n) H(2)l−n (Γ0b)×Jn (Γ0r¯) e−inφ¯ e−i(l−n)β}. (25)Now substitute Equation (25) into Equation (20) to find theincident field. Expressing this in the form of Equations (6,7)givesp′i(r¯, φ¯, z¯, t)=1(2π)2∞∑n=−∞{(∫ ∞−∞p′in e−ikz z¯ dkz)e−inφ¯}, (26)wherep′in (r¯, kz , t) = π2 ξlq Plq (−1)l+n e−i(l−n)β (k0 + kzMz)×Ψlq H(2)l−n (Γ0 b) Jn (Γ0r¯) eiω0t . (27)C. Scattered fieldSince the scattering object is an infinite cylinder, the scat-tered acoustic waves will be outward propagating cylindricalwaves. The scattered field is given byp′s(r¯, φ¯, z¯, t)=1(2π)2∞∑n=−∞{(∫ ∞−∞p′sn e−ikz z¯ dkz)e−inφ¯}, (28)wherep′sn (r¯, kz , t) =12π∫ ∞−∞An (kz , ω) H(2)n (Γ r¯) eiωt dω ,(29)andΓ is given by Equation (10) with k0 replaced by k = ω/c0.4The total pressure field p′t due to the distributed source lo-cated adjacent to an infinite, rigid cylinder is given byp′t = p′i + p′s , (30)where the total field satisfies a rigid wall boundary conditionon the surface of the cylinder, i.e.∂p′t∂r¯= 0 at r¯ = a0 . (31)Taking the Fourier transform leads to∂p′tn∂r¯=∂p′in∂r¯+∂p′sn∂r¯= 0 at r¯ = a0 . (32)On substituting Equations (27) and (29) into the boundarycondition (32) this gives(π2 ξlq Plq (−1)l+n e−i(l−n)β (k0 + kzMz) Ψlq ×H(2)l−n (Γ0 b) Γ0 J′n (Γ0a0) eiω0t)+12π∫ ∞−∞An (kz, ω) ΓH(2) ′n (Γa0) eiωt dω = 0 , (33)where ′ denotes differentiation with respect to the function’sargument.In order to solve Equation (33), setAn (kz, ω) = Bn (kz , ω) δ (ω − ω0) , (34)where δ (ω) is the Dirac-delta function. The result isBn (kz , ω0) = −2π3 ξlq Plq (−1)l+n e−i(l−n)β ×(k0 + kzMz) Ψlq H(2)l−n (Γ0 b)×(J′n (Γ0a0)/H(2) ′n (Γ0a0)), (35)andp′sn (r¯, kz , t) = −π2 ξlq Plq (−1)l+n e−i(l−n)β ×(k0 + kzMz) Ψlq H(2)l−n (Γ0 b) H(2)n (Γ0r¯)×(J′n (Γ0a0)/H(2) ′n (Γ0a0))eiω0t . (36)D. Total fieldThe total pressure field p′t is given byp′t(r¯, φ¯, z¯, t)=1(2π)2∞∑n=−∞{(∫ ∞−∞p′tn e−ikz z¯ dkz)e−inφ¯}, (37)wherep′tn = p′in + p′sn . (38)Summing Equations (27) and (36) givesp′tn (r¯, kz, t) = π2 ξlq Plq (−1)l+n e−i(l−n)β ×(k0 + kzMz) Ψlq H(2)l−n (Γ0 b)×[ (Jn (Γ0r¯) H(2) ′n (Γ0a0)−J′n (Γ0a0) H(2)n (Γ0r¯))/H(2) ′n (Γ0a0)]eiω0t . (39)On the surface of the cylinder r¯ = a0. Using the Wronskianformula,Jn(x)H(2) ′n (x)− J′n(x)H(2)n (x) = −i(2πx), (40)leads top′tn (a0, kz , t) = π2 ξlq Plq (−1)l+n e−i(l−n)β ×(k0 + kzMz) Ψlq H(2)l−n (Γ0 b)×[(− i(2/πΓ0a0))/H(2) ′n (Γ0a0)]eiω0t . (41)Finally, the total pressure field on the surface of the cylinderis expressed in the formp′t(a0, φ¯, z¯, t)=ξlq Plq4(−1)l e−ilβ eiω0t∞∑n=−∞{(−1)n I(wc)n (a0, z¯) e−in(φ¯−β)}, (42)whereI(wc)n (a0, z¯) =∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) Ψlq H(2)l−n (Γ0 b)×[(− i(2/πΓ0a0))/H(2) ′n (Γ0a0)]e−ikz z¯ dkz . (43)The superscript (wc) denotes ‘with cylinder’.By way of comparison, rearranging equations (26) and (27),the incident pressure field on r¯ = a0, in the absence of thecylinder, can be expressed in the same form as Equation (42),by replacing I (wc)n withI(nc)n (a0, z¯) =∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) Ψlq H(2)l−n (Γ0 b)×Jn (Γ0a0) e−ikz z¯ dkz . (44)The superscript (nc) denotes ‘no cylinder’.Equations (42–44) are the key results derived from this newanalysis.III. VALIDATIONA. Incident fieldIn McAlpine and Kingan5, distributed source models arederived for an open rotor. These can be used to model either5thickness noise or loading noise. In this work, a different formof distributed source is used to model fan tone noise for a tur-bofan engine. The distributed source is based on the pressurepattern for an individual spinning duct mode. Rotor-alone fantones are suitable to model in terms of spinning modes. Otherfan tones also can be modelled using multi-mode sources, pro-vided that it is appropriate to sum these sources incoherently.The calculation of the distributed source’s near field ne-glects diffraction by the intake duct lip. (The duct itself is notincluded in the modelling.) As mentioned in the Introduction,Hoctor2 has shown that for practical applications, the direc-tivity patterns for spinning modes radiated from a cylindricalduct, calculated using the Wiener–Hopf technique (unflangedduct) and using the Rayleigh integral approach, should be ingood agreement at least up to polar angles around 70 ◦.In Gabard and Astley8, a new Wiener–Hopf solution is de-rived for a time-harmonic spinning mode exiting an annularduct where there is a vortex sheet between the jet flow and thefreestream. This solution also can be used for an intake duct(where there is no vortex sheet) taking uniform mean flow ev-erywhere. In this case, the result is equivalent to the Wiener–Hopf solution in Homicz and Lordi9. The code based on thesolution in Gabard and Astley is named ‘GXMunt’. A sketchof the problem set-up is shown in Fig. 6(a).The amplitude of the incident mode is specified. The near-and/or far-field pressure can be evaluated using the GXMuntcode. This method includes diffraction at the duct exit, albeitthe duct wall is infinitely thin, so a realistic intake lip profileis not modelled. Also reflection at the duct termination is in-cluded in the method.By comparison, a sketch of the problem set-up to calcu-late sound radiation using the distributed source is shown inFig. 6(b). This method does not include diffraction at the ductexit. Also reflection at the duct termination is not included inthe method. (This is because there is no duct.)The purpose of this validation study is to assess whetherthe distributed source model can be used to accurately modela spinning mode exiting a cylindrical duct. A series of val-idation test cases have been carried out. The expectation isthat the distributed source model will be appropriate to use formost modes, other than modes near cut off. This is becausethe principal radiation lobe, for a mode that is close to beingcut-off, will be at polar angle close to 90◦, so diffraction by theduct lip is likely to be more significant. In addition, more en-ergy will be reflected by the duct termination for modes nearcut off.A selection of the results from the validation study areshown in Figs. 7 & 8. All the results are obtained in the nearfield at R = 1m. Polar directivity plots are shown, whichinclude the predicted levels calculated by the two methods.Also an example of the radiated pressure field visualised on ahemispherical three-dimensional plot is shown.Overall, the near-field pressures predicted by both methodsare very similar. As expected, there are small discrepanciesbetween the two methods, but these only occur at high polarangles greater than ≈ 75◦. Also, the absolute levels are verysimilar, so for these test cases, reflections at the duct termina-tion are weak, and can be neglected.Although the Wiener–Hopf solution is based on a more re-alistic model of sound radiation from an intake duct, this so-lution is far less amenable to use to specify the incident fieldIntake ductzrRprpi(l,q)’(l,q)’MzMzDistributedsourcezrR(a)(b)MzMzFIG. 6.

In this case, an appropriate reference so-lution is the scattered field due to a monopole source adjacentto a rigid cylinder which has been published previously byFuller4.In the reference solution, the distributed source shown inFig. 2 is replaced by a stationary monopole point source lo-cated at the origin of the coordinate system (x, y, z). Usingthe nomenclature employed in this article, the total pressureon the surface of the cylinder, due to a monopole source withvolume velocity Q0 exp {iω0t}, can be expressed in the formp′t(a0, φ¯, z¯, t)=Q0ρ0c08πeiω0t∞∑n=−∞{I(wc)nmono (a0, z¯)×e−in(φ¯−β)}, (45)whereI(wc)nmono (a0, z¯) =∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) H(2)n (Γ0 b)×[(− i(2/πΓ0a0))/H(2) ′n (Γ0a0)]e−ikz z¯ dkz . (46)Also the incident pressure field on r¯ = a0, in the absenceof the cylinder, can be expressed in the same form as Equation(45), by replacing I (wc)nmono withI(nc)nmono (a0, z¯) =∫ ∞−∞(k0 + kzMz) H(2)n (Γ0 b)×Jn (Γ0a0) e−ikz z¯ dkz . (47)Equations (45–47) can be obtained from the solutions for arotating monopole source detailed in McAlpine and Kingan 5.Equations (36,37) in Ref.5, on taking r¯ = a0, give the to-tal pressure field for a rotating monopole source on the sur-face of the cylinder. On setting Ω = 0, the field for a sta-tionary point source is recovered. However, this source islocated at (x, y, z) = (a, 0, 0), so also it is necessary to seta = 0, which will eliminate the summation in Equation (37) inRef.5, and the expression for p′t(a0, φ¯, z¯, t)reduces to Equa-tions (45,46). In order to obtain Equation (47), use Equation(25) instead of Equation (37) in Ref.5, which is the appropriateequation for the incident pressure field for a rotating monopolesource, expressed in the coordinate system(r¯, φ¯, z¯)centredon the cylindrical fuselage.Fuller4 has examined the effect of spherical acoustic wavesimpinging on a rigid cylinder in the absence of any mean flow.In order to assess the cylinder scattering and blockage effects,Fuller defined the ‘scattering correction factor’αc = 20 log10(1 +p′sp′i∣∣∣∣∣r¯=a0)= 20 log10(p′tp′i∣∣∣∣∣r¯=a0).(48)In Figure 2 from Ref.4, the values of the correction factorαc for a monopole source located adjacent to a rigid cylin-der are plotted for four examples of low frequency sources,with Helmholtz number ka0 = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0. Themonopole is located at x¯/a0 = 2, y¯/a0 = 0 and z¯/a0 = 0.The correction factor is calculated in the range, φ¯ = 0 to 180◦,in the source plane z¯/a0 = 0.Data points from Figure 2 in Fuller4 are reproduced inFig. 9. The symbols (◦), (), () and (×) show the pre-viously published data from Ref.4. At Helmholtz numberka0 = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0, the published results are com-pared against predictions of αc computed by evaluating Equa-tions (45–47). The purpose of this comparison is to verify thatthe computation of the scattered field generated by a sourceadjacent to a rigid cylinder has been properly implemented. Inthis case, with a monopole source, it is seen in Fig. 9 that thepressure field on the cylinder has been accurately computedsince the computed values of αc are in very good agreementwith the data from Ref.4.Results of αc computed by evaluating Equations (42–44)for a small distributed source are compared against the resultsfor the monopole source at Helmholtz number ka 0 = 0.5, 1.0,2.0 and 4.0 in Fig. 10. The example is the same as shown inFig. 9, and in Figure 2 in Fuller4, except now αc has beencomputed for a distributed source adjacent to a rigid cylinder.The distributed source has radius a/a0 = 0.01, which is verysmall, thus the Helmholtz number of the distributed sourceka << 1, and the source radiation is approximately the sameas the radiation from a monopole point source. This resultconfirms that the computation of the scattered field generated70 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180−20−15−10−50510φ [deg]αc[dB]FIG. 9.

Convergence studyIn §§III.B it is seen that the pressure fields due to amonopole or distributed source adjacent to a rigid cylinderare comparable at very low Helmholtz numbers. It is inter-esting to examine the mathematical solution for the pressurefield on the surface of the cylinder due to a distributed source(42,43), in the limit as the source’s radius a → 0. In this limit,all the duct modes are cut-off except the plane wave mode(l, q) = (0, 1) for which κ01 = 0, kz01 = k, ξ01 = 1 andpˆ01/uˆz 01 = ρ0c0 (refer to § II, §§ II.A, Equations (1–4)). Inessence the distributed source is equivalent to a small pistonvibrating time-harmonically.The only term in Equations (42,43) which is dependent onthe source radius a is the function Ψlq (21). It can be shownthatΨ01 =⎧⎨⎩12 a2 +O((Γ0a)3), Γ0 > 012 a2 +O((γ0a)3), Γ0 = −iγ0 , γ0 > 0(49)Then it is straightforward to show that Equations (42,43) re-duce to Equations (45,46) on settingΨ01 =12a2 andP01ρ0c0(πa2)= Q0 , (50)the latter being equivalent to Equation (16). This reducesthe solution for the pressure field on the surface of the cylin-der due to a distributed source to that of the solution for themonopole source.However, replacing Ψ01 by 12 a2 is only valid if terms ofO((Γ0a)3)and O((γ0a)3)are negligible. Evaluation ofI(wc)n (43) involves integration over kz . As seen in Fig-ure 4, in the range −k0/ (1 +Mz) < kz < k0/ (1−Mz)(cf. Equation 11), Γ0 is real and positive. In this range, themaximum value of Γ0 = k0/√1−M2z , so in the limit asa → 0, terms of O((Γ0a)3)will be negligible provided thatk0a/√1−M2z << 1.However, outside this range, Γ0 = −iγ0 where γ0 is realand positive. As kz → ±∞ then γ0 → |kz |√1−M2z so itcannot be assumed that terms of O((γ0a)3)are negligible inthe limit as a → 0 because γ0 has no upper bound.Thus, replacing Ψ01 by 12 a2 in Equation (43), in the limitas a → 0, strictly is not permissible. However, in practice,finite integration limits, say −K < kz < K , will be takenin order to evaluate the integral over kz using numerical in-tegration. These limits can be determined by the asymptoticexpansion of the Hankel function H(2)n for large argument. Itcan be shown thatH(2)n (Γ0b)H(2) ′n (Γ0a0)∼ e−|kz|√1−M2z(b−a0)as kz → ±∞ , (51)and thus the integrand in Equation (43) will be exponentiallysmall at sufficiently large |kz |. The integration limits alsowill depend on (b− a0) which is the distance of the sourcefrom the nearest point on the cylinder’s surface. Therefore, inpractice, terms of O((γ0a)3)will be negligible provided thatKa√1−M2z << 1.This brief analysis verifies that computation of the pressurefield on the cylinder’s surface for a small distributed source, atvery low frequency, will be equivalent to the computation ofthe pressure field for a monopole source, provided that the ra-dius a of the disc is sufficiently small. Numerical verificationof this result is shown in Figure 10.Finally, as part of the validation, the convergence of the so-lutions for the incident and scattered fields are examined.

Example of convergence for the simulation results from thedistributed source code. The relative error  (52) is shown in (a) forthe incident field p′i (—) and in (b) for the scattered field p′s (- - -).In each case the converged solution is used as the reference valuein Equation (52). The example is for mode (20, 1), f = 5000Hz,Mz = 0.5, b/a0 = 3, a/a0 = 0.5, β = 0◦. (This validation testcase also has been used in § III, §§ III.A, cf. Fig. 7(d) and Fig. 8.)The error is evaluated over the surface of the cylinder extending fromz¯/a0 = 0 to 5.expressions both for the incident and scattered pressure fields,(26) and (28) respectively, involve infinite summations overthe azimuthal harmonics n. These summations are truncatedat the N th harmonic, once it has been checked that the serieshas converged. The value of N is dependent on the parame-ters of each specific calculation of the incident and scatteredfields.An example showing convergence of both the incident andscattered fields is shown in Fig. 11. Convergence is monitoredvia the average root mean square relative error, , which isdefined by (N′) =√√√√ 1MM∑ ∣∣∣∣∣p′N′ − p′Np′N∣∣∣∣∣2, (52)where the subscript  denotes either i or s for the incident orscattered pressure field respectively. In Equation (52) the sub-script N ′ denotes the pressure field which has been calculatedby summing up to the N ′th harmonic only. The convergedsolution is reached when N ′ → N . Also the squared relativeerror has been averaged over all the grid points on the surfaceof the cylinder, where M denotes the total number of gridpoints. The square root of this average gives the rms value ofthe relative error. It can be seen in Fig. 11 that the convergencerate of the incident and scattered fields are very similar, andin this example which is at a relatively high-frequency, it isnecessary to include more than a hundred harmonics in orderto obtain a converged solution.IV.

In both test casesthe same negative angle for β is used (refer to Fig. 2 wherethe angle β is defined).A. No cylinderAn example of measurements from a static intake rig testconducted at the AneCom AeroTest facility are utilised to pro-vide some illustrative results. The measurements were firstpublished in Sugimoto et al.10 In this article, some measure-ments acquired by a near-field microphone array from Ref. 10are reproduced.The model fan rig is around one-third full-scale. Soundproduced by the fan propagates inside the model intake duct,and radiates into an anechoic chamber. Outside the intake thesound was measured by a linear near-field microphone array,and a polar far-field microphone array. No model-scale fuse-lage was used in the tests, but the near-field array was posi-tioned roughly where an adjacent fuselage would be located,such that the microphones’ positions were all forward of thefan plane in a linear array. A sketch of the experimental set-upis shown in Fig. 12(a).The example results reproduced in this article are the mea-surements at blade passing frequency (BPF) at 90 % fan speed(supersonic fan operating condition). At this frequency, in to-tal around eighty modes are predicted to be cut-on, rangingfrom azimuthal order l = −22 to 22. The sound field in-side the intake was measured with a linear axial microphonearray and also a circumferential mode detection array. Thefan had twenty blades; hence the rotor-locked modal compo-9nent of the BPF tone sound field will be predominantly mode(l, q) = (20, 1) since, at this high fan speed, the higher radialorders at azimuthal order l = 20 are cut-off. Mode detectiondata is shown in Figure 3 in Ref.10. The rotor-locked mode,azimuthal order l = 20, measured inside the lined intake, isaround 15 to 20 dB higher compared to the non-rotor-lockedazimuthal orders in the range l = −22 to 22, which in turnare higher than the background noise floor. The level of therotor-locked mode, compared to the non-rotor-locked modes,inside the unlined intake was much higher, but the value ofthe mode protrusion could not be determined because the dy-namic range of the microphone array was not sufficient. How-ever, as shown in Figure 4(a) in Ref.10, the measured BPF toneis at least 25 dB higher in the unlined intake compared to thelined intake duct. Assuming that most of the energy is con-tained in the rotor-locked mode, inside the unlined intake, anestimate of the rotor-locked mode protrusion is around 45 dBhigher compared to the non-rotor-locked azimuthal orders.Near-field array measurements compared with predictionsare shown in Fig. 13. The near-field array data is reproducedfrom Figure 4(b) in Ref.10. The non-dimensional axial posi-tion is defined Z = z¯/a0. The first microphone in the lineararray was located at Z = 0, in the same plane as the termina-tion (exit) of the intake duct. The rest of the microphones wereall located upstream in the forward arc. Also the linear arrayis located at φ¯ = 0. The measurements of the sound pres-sure level (SPL) have been adjusted. For both measurementand prediction, the maximum SPL has been scaled to equalzero. Multi-mode predictions have been performed, wherebythe radiated field of each cut-on mode is calculated, and thenthe SPL has been calculated by summing the modes incoher-ently.In Fig. 13(a), the prediction on taking equal energy permode is shown. (The link between the modal power andmodal amplitude is given by Eq. (5).) Also shown are themeasurements with the lined and unlined intake. It is evidentthat simply assuming equal energy per mode is not appropri-ate in this case. This is because, as discussed, at this highfan speed, the rotor-locked mode will be the principal com-ponent of the sound field. In Figs. 13(b) & (c), the predictedresults are for equal energy per mode, except the rotor-lockedmode (l, q) = (20, 1). It’s modal amplitude has been adjustedto include +45 dB tone protrusion with the unlined intake,Fig. 13(b), or +20 dB tone protrusion with the lined intake,Fig. 13(c). In both cases, the predictions show much closeragreement with the measured data.Also shown are predictions for just the rotor-locked mode.With the unlined intake, the level of the rotor-locked tonalcomponent decays rapidly with distance upstream. In the re-gion 0 < Z < 2 the rotor-locked mode is dominant, but fur-ther upstream in the region Z > 3 it is the non-rotor-lockedcomponents of the sound field which are dominant. This is ex-pected because the non-rotor-locked components of the soundfield include modes which propagate close to the axis of theintake duct. With the lined intake, the level of the rotor-lockedmode is lower, owing to attenuation by the lining, so the rotor-locked mode is dominant over a smaller upstream extent, inthe region 0 < Z < 1.0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4−40−35−30−25−20−15−10−50Z [non-dimensional]SPL[dB] Measured data (lined)Measured data (unlined)Prediction(a) Source = equal energy per mode.0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4−40−35−30−25−20−15−10−50Z [non-dimensional]SPL[dB] Measured data (unlined)PredictionPrediction (l,q) = (20,1)(b) Source = equal energy per mode except rotor-lockedmode (l, q) = (20, 1), +45dB tone protrusion.0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4−40−35−30−25−20−15−10−50Z [non-dimensional]SPL[dB] Measured data (lined)PredictionPrediction (l,q) = (20,1)(c) Source = equal energy per mode except rotor-lockedmode (l, q) = (20, 1), +20dB tone protrusion.FIG. 13.

Ineach example the sound pressure levels have been adjusted to set themaximum value equal to zero. (Color online)B. With cylinderIllustrative examples showing SPL contours on a cylindri-cal fuselage are shown in Fig. 14. A sketch of the simulationset-up is shown in Fig. 12(b). In these examples, the pres-sure on the cylinder in the region 0 < Z < 10 is shown. Asbefore, the levels have been adjusted and the maximum SPLequals zero. The source models used for the simulations inFig. 14(a–c) correspond to the same source models used forthe simulations in Fig. 13(a–c) respectively. Additionally inFig. 15 the effect of the cylindrical fuselage is quantified byplotting contours of the difference in the sound pressure levelwith and without the cylinder. This difference is defined asΔ = SPLwith cylinder − SPLno cylinder . (53)Only the contour plot of Δ for the equal energy per modesource is shown. The contour plots for the other two examples(including the effect of rotor-locked mode protrusion) are verysimilar.In these examples, there is only one source region, so on thefar side of the cylinder there is a shadow zone where the levelsare much lower. It is seen in Fig. 15 that around φ¯ = 180◦,the levels on the cylinder can be up to 40 dB lower comparedto the near side of the cylinder. In fact, on the near side ofthe cylinder, around φ¯ = 0, the levels on the cylinder arearound 6 dB higher compared without the cylinder; this is dueto pressure doubling.On examining how the sound field varies along the axialextent of the cylinder, the maximum SPL is seen to be locatedclose to the source plane, but not at z¯/a0 = 0. The maximumSPL would be at z¯/a0 = 0 if the mode angle was equal to 90◦,but all the cut-on modes have mode angles less than 90◦. Infact, the mode angles associated with the rotor-locked modesare, typically, in the range between 70◦ to 80◦. Hence themaximum SPL will be near the source plane, but further up-stream the levels can fall rapidly with axial distance owing tothe rapidly falling level of the rotor-locked modal componentof the pressure field, as shown in Fig. 13(b) & (c).V. CONCLUSIONSA new theoretical solution has been derived which predictsthe acoustic pressure on a cylinder fuselage due to a discsource located adjacent to the cylinder. The distributed sourceis specified in terms of a spinning mode in a cylindrical duct.Hence this model can be used for single-mode calculationsof the pressure on a cylindrical fuselage owing to a fan toneradiated from a turbofan intake duct. The methodology fol-lows similar analysis which has been published previously fora point source adjacent to a cylinder. This type of solution alsohas been derived for source models for an open rotor. (Theseuse rotating point or distributed source models.)Illustrative examples show how this model can be used topredict the near-field acoustic pressure. Comparison with ex-perimental measurements show the importance of simulatinga multi-mode source in order to correctly predict the near-fieldpressure. Thus it is inferred that the pressure on the fuselagealso should be predicted by modelling fan tones using multi-mode sources. This is of particular relevance for supersonic11Z [non-dimensional]φ[deg] [dB]0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1004590135180225270315−40−35−30−25−20−15−10−50510FIG. 15.

Additionally, future work will inves-tigate whether the theoretical solution of the incident field dueto a spinning mode radiated from an unflanged duct can beused instead of the disc source.AcknowledgmentsThe authors wishes to acknowledge the continuing financialsupport provided by Rolls–Royce plc through the UniversityTechnology Centre in Gas Turbine Noise at the Institute ofSound and Vibration Research.1 J.
