ABSTRACT: 
‘Culture’ features prominently in the literature on international mediation: if belligerents share cultural characteristics, they are likely to have a common understanding and norms. This creates a common identity and makes coordination less costly, which ultimately facilitates mediation occurrence and effectiveness. Surprisingly, existing quantitative research largely neglects any cultural ties the antagonists might share with the mediator. This article addresses this gap by offering one of the first joint analyses of fighting parties’ and mediators’ culture – and the interaction thereof. Based on existing work, a theoretical framework for mediation occurrence and effectiveness is developed and innovative measures for belligerents’ cultural ties and the links to the mediator are used. Contrary to expectations the results suggest that larger cultural distances between antagonists make mediation more likely, while cultural dissimilarities between them and the mediator have the opposite effect. Evidence is also found for a conditional effect between the two culture variables on mediation occurrence.

 Barriers to Coordination? Examining the Impactof Culture on International Mediation Occurrenceand EffectivenessZorzeta BakakiETH ZürichTobias BöhmeltUniversity of EssexVincenzo BoveUniversity of Warwick‘Culture’ features prominently in the literature on international mediation: if belligerents share cultural characteristics,they are likely to have a common understanding and norms. This creates a common identity and makes coordinationless costly, which ultimately facilitates mediation occurrence and effectiveness. Surprisingly, existing quantitativeresearch largely neglects any cultural ties the antagonists might share with the mediator. This article addresses this gapby offering one of the first joint analyses of fighting parties’ and mediators’ culture – and the interaction thereof. Basedon existing work, a theoretical framework for mediation occurrence and effectiveness is developed and innovativemeasures for belligerents’ cultural ties and the links to the mediator are used. The results suggest that larger culturaldistances between antagonists make mediation more likely, while cultural dissimilarities between them and themediator have the opposite effect. Evidence is also found for a conditional effect between the two culture variableson mediation occurrence.Keywords: culture; international mediation; mediation occurrence; mediation effective-ness; quantitative analysisInternational mediation – ‘a process of conflict management where disputants seek theassistance of, or accept an offer of help from, an individual, group, state or organisation tosettle their conflict or resolve their differences without resorting to physical force orinvoking the authority of the law’ (Bercovitch et al., 1991, p. 8; see also Touval andZartman, 1985) – is generally perceived as a crucial and effective instrument for thenon-violent resolution of inter- and intra-state disputes. For instance, the Issue Correlatesof War (ICOW) dataset (Hensel et al., 2008), which we will be using for the empiricalanalysis of this research, list 244 issue claims1 between 1816 and 2001, of which 132 (54.10per cent) have seen at least one mediation attempt according to the definition above. Intotal, the data identify 532 different mediation attempts, of which 219 (41.17 per cent)were effective to the extent that the belligerents either complied with a mediationagreement or an issue claim was comprehensively settled.Given the importance of this conflict-resolution tool, it is not surprising that previousresearch examined international mediation extensively, with a particular focus on thedeterminants of mediation occurrence and success (for recent literature reviews, see, e.g.Hellman, 2012; Wallensteen and Svensson, 2014). In short, both the belligerents and a(potential) mediator must have an interest in an intervention – i.e. demand and supply-sideincentives are a necessary requirement for mediation to occur (e.g. Beardsley, 2008; 2010).Moreover, Touval and Zartman (1985, p. 40) emphasise that ‘third parties are onlyaccepted as mediators if they are likely to produce an agreement or help the parties out ofa predicament’.

Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies Association1bs_bs_queryof international mediation focus on the characteristics of the antagonists, the characteristicsof the dispute, and the mediators or type of mediation.Particularly with regard to the belligerents’ characteristics, the literature identified‘culture’ as a prominent influence of mediation occurrence and effectiveness (see LondoñoLázaro, 2003, p. 325). Culture is a ‘system of meaning and value shared by a community,informing its way of life, and enabling it to make sense of the world’ (Cohen, 1996, p.109). More formally, we define culture along the lines of Carnevale and Choi (2000, p. 16;see also Inman et al., 2014, p. 4):Culture specifies what behaviors are desirable or proscribed for members of the culture(norms), for individuals in the social structure (roles), as well as the important goals andprinciples in one’s life (values). Culture also specifies how things are to be evaluated(Carnevale, 1995). This implies that people of different cultures will have greater difficulty ininteraction, in understanding, and valuation.Common cultural bonds or, conversely, cultural distances between the disputants are likelyto affect mediation and its outcomes: ‘because leaders of countries make the decisionsabout whether or not to engage in mediation, culture will both shape their perceptions ofthe utility of the method’ (Inman et al., 2014, p. 5).In more detail, culture forms actors’ reality, perceptions and evaluations of issues, theirideas and preferences (Londoño Lázaro, 2003, p. 325). If actors have a similar culture oreven share the same one, this shared understanding forms a connection between them thatshould make mediation and an effective outcome more likely due to two interrelated, butdifferent reasons: a common identity and fewer costs of coordination (e.g. Inman et al.,2014; Leng and Regan, 2003; Lohmann, 2011). First, a shared understanding and a culturalbond between actors form a common identity (Bercovitch and Foulkes, 2012; Burton,1969; Hofstede, 1980; Kandogan, 2012; Lohmann, 2011; Sunoo, 1990). In turn, acommon identity may make it more likely that the antagonists agree on a mediator (dueto shared norms, such as the norm of conflict resolution) and can more easily negotiatewith each other (e.g. due to the same negotiation styles, perceptions, ideas, understandingsor interests). Sunoo (1990), for instance, demonstrates that individuals interact and nego-tiate very differently across cultures, which could prevent successful negotiation outcomesand lead to conflict instead.Second, cultural dissimilarities make coordination more costly. If the cultural distancebetween the actors is high, there might be different norms, different perceptions and moremisunderstandings. Agreeing on some form of third-party intervention or even negotiatingthe terms of a peace agreement may not be impossible then, but certainly more difficult.In fact, Burton (1969) contends that dissimilar cultural characteristics between a fightingparty and a mediator might well hamper mediation due to higher coordination costs.Effortless coordination between the parties, however, could make it easier to communicateand agree on some standards (such as how to negotiate, where, with what representatives)more easily in the first place, and it facilitates the decision-making process due to a lowerlikelihood of misunderstanding and, as a result, the resolution of a conflict (e.g. Beardsley,2008; Beardsley et al., 2006). For example, Augsburger (1992, pp. 73ff) focuses on conceptslike ‘face,’ ‘harmony’ or ‘honour’ and studies their role in Western and traditional1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2 ZORZETA BAKAKI, TOBIAS BÖHMELT AND VINCENZO BOVE© 2015 The Authors.

He notes that Western cultures are more individualistic whilethe traditional cultures are more collectivistic. While this makes negotiations and conflictresolution between actors from these different cultures more difficult due to the absence ofshared norms and common understandings, he also notes that a mediator could be able tocircumvent these cultural barriers. Hence, the literature presents convincing arguments forwhy actors’ (i.e. belligerents’ and mediators’) culture may matter for mediation occurrenceand effectiveness.Somewhat surprisingly, however, the existent quantitative work largely focuses on thecultural relationship between the belligerents, while it neglects cultural ties to the (poten-tial) mediator and any interactive effects between belligerent’s culture and the cultural tiesto the third party. Noteworthy exceptions from diplomatic history do exist (e.g. Iklé,1964), but these are largely of a qualitative nature, only examine specific cases and may belimited in their generalisability. For example, Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter and RichardNixon highlight the role of culture in their memoirs when talking about their mediationefforts (see Avruch, 1998, p. 41). Moreover, several scholars claim that the culturaldisharmony between Secretary of State James Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Azizwas the major cause of the failure of the US mediation efforts over the course of theIraq-Kuwait conflict in 1990–1 (Kimmel, 1994; Payne, 1995, p. 93).This article seeks to address the cultural impact on mediation by offering one of the firstjoint quantitative analyses of antagonists’ and mediators’ culture – and the interactionthereof. We first develop a theoretical framework for mediation occurrence and effective-ness that focuses on cultural links between the fighting parties, ties from the antagonists tothe mediators and the joint impact of these factors. To this end, we argue that culturalsimilarities (distances) between the belligerents should make mediation occurrence andeffectiveness more (less) likely; that cultural similarities (distances) between the belligerentsand the (potential) mediator should make mediation occurrence and effectiveness more(less) likely; and that the interaction of belligerents’ culture and the cultural ties with themediator also matters for explaining mediation occurrence and effectiveness.In the next section, we review existing and develop new theoretical arguments, whichlead to the expectation that cultural distance between the actors involved generally decreasesthe likelihood of mediation occurrence and effectiveness. Afterwards, we describe theresearch design and present the results. Our findings show that mediation is more likely tooccur when, first, the belligerents are in fact culturally more dissimilar and, second, when(potential) mediators share cultural similarities with the belligerents. At the same time,however, culture is unlikely to affect mediation outcomes. Finally, the analysis of theinteractive effects demonstrates that the cultural ties between the antagonists condition theimpact of the cultural links to the mediator on mediation. We conclude by discussing theseresults in light of the previous research and by presenting implications for future studies.Culture and Mediation: A Theoretical FrameworkBelligerents’ Culture and MediationGenerally, culture forms norms, expectations and values, which influence state leaders and,thus, states’ behaviour (Inman et al., 2014, p. 2).

Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015mediation is an exception here: states are influenced by norms and values, and thereforeby their identity and cultural background when considering mediation, when offering it,and when belligerents actually negotiate with each other in the context of third-partymediation.Bercovitch and Elgström (2001) offer the first systematic analysis of how culturaldifferences and similarities between the belligerents influence mediation. This studyinspired succeeding work with a similar focus in international relations – e.g. Leng andRegan (2003), Bercovitch and Foulkes (2012), or Inman et al. (2014).2 The argument forwhy the fighting parties’ culture might influence mediation is fairly common in these andrelated studies: a shared culture leads to a common identity and fewer coordination costs,which makes it more likely that mediation occurs and is effective. In more detail, first,culture forms identities, which in turn may fuel in-group and out-group dynamics (Cohen,1996; LeBaron, 2003; Ting-Toomey and Oetzel, 2001). Culture can thus contain a bodyof meaning shared by a group, which then facilitates coordination, or it is a ‘barrier thatexcludes those who do not belong to the group’ (Londoño Lázaro, 2003, p. 340).However, similar cultures are related to common patterns of interacting and reacting to theactions of others, as well as shared values and beliefs (Leng and Regan, 2003, p. 432). Ifbelligerents have cultural similarities, in-group characteristics may weigh substantially,‘fostering an acceptance of mediation or other cooperative conflict resolution methods’(Inman et al., 2014, p. 6). In other words, a shared identity is based on common norms,expectations and values, which form a connection between the parties that makes it morelikely that they agree on a common norm of conflict resolution: mediation. Hopmann(1996, p. 144) states that there are cultural values and beliefs that affect all aspects ofnegotiations. Even the way that nations conceive resolution processes might reflect on theircultural heritage. For instance, the negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians or theUS and Cuba (with or without third-party mediation), are affected by persuasive culturalfactors.Second, the coordination between antagonists from different (or distant) cultures will bemore costly, ‘based on either inferred or experienced divergences in conflict style, norms,communication and emotional expression’ (Inman et al., 2014, p. 6; see also Ting-Toomeyand Oetzel, 2001). In the words of Cohen (1996, p. 110), ‘culture constructs reality,different cultures construct reality differently, communication across cultures pits differentconstructions of reality against each other’. As a result, the higher the cultural distancebetween two parties, the more likely it is that misunderstandings do exist, the difficulty ofcommunication increases and coordination becomes less straightforward. Leng and Regan(2003, p. 434) highlight that ‘problems may arise from misunderstandings generated bydissimilar negotiating or bargaining styles, or in the meanings attached to signals’ inmediation contexts involving belligerents from different cultures. Ultimately, the bellig-erents may perceive that the costs associated with mediation outweigh the benefits of apeaceful agreement (Inman et al., 2014, p. 6).In light of these two different, yet highly related claims, actors from different culturesreact, behave and perceive signals differently (Leng and Regan, 2003, p. 432). This makesit more difficult to find a ‘common ground’, decreasing the chances of mediation occur-rence and effective outcomes.

Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015focuses on the belligerents only (see also Inman et al., 2014, p. 8; Londoño Lázaro, 2003,p. 330)3 and we seek to go beyond this in the following. That said, the discussion so farleads to the first hypothesis (see also Bercovitch and Elgström, 2001; Bercovitch andFoulkes, 2012; Inman et al., 2014; Leng and Regan, 2003):H1: The higher the cultural distance between the belligerents, the less likely it is that theyagree on mediation (occurrence) and, if it does occur, that it is successful (outcome).Belligerents’ Cultural Ties to MediatorsA (potential) mediator must have certain characteristics that make them attractive for theantagonists to be allowed to intervene. The previous literature has identified credibility asbeing one of the most important factors here (e.g. Beardsley, 2008; Beardsley et al., 2006;Kydd, 2003; 2006; Rauchhaus, 2006; Savun, 2008; Smith and Stam, 2003; Svensson, 2007;2009; Svensson and Lindgren, 2013; Wallensteen and Svensson, 2014). In fact, a prereq-uisite for the provision of information leading to efficient and effective coordination is thecredibility of the mediator (Dorussen and Ward, 2008, p. 193): the more credible amediator, the more likely it is that he or she is accepted by the disputing actors as anintervener and the higher the prospects for success (see also Bercovitch and Houston, 2000;Regan and Aydin, 2006). In light of this, we argue that common cultural characteristicsbetween the antagonists and the mediator could be credibility assets, which ultimatelyinfluence the prospects for mediation occurrence and effectiveness (Kydd, 2006; see alsoBercovitch and Foulkes, 2012; Carnevale and Choi, 2000; Inman et al., 2014; Leng andRegan, 2003; Ott, 1972; Young, 1967). For instance, Davis (1981) uses an experimentaldesign to demonstrate that cultural similarity between conflicting actors and a potentialmediator affects attraction, making the third party more credible and, thus, acceptable toboth sides.First, and similar to the argumentation above, culture forms norms, expectations andvalues that, if shared with a potential mediator, form a connection between the belligerentsand the third party (Bercovitch and Foulkes, 2012; Block and Siegel, 2011; Burton, 1969;Carnevale and Choi, 2000; Hofstede, 1980; Kandogan, 2012; Lohmann, 2011; Sunoo,1990). This connection leads to a common identity between the mediator and theantagonists: links between a (potential) mediator and the belligerents generally make thetransmission of information about interests and intentions more credible (Dorussen andWard, 2008). In turn, the belligerents perceive the third party as ‘one of them’, and mayeventually increase the probability of mediation occurrence and effectiveness due tocommon norms, similar ideas and preferences (Bercovitch and Foulkes, 2012; Block andSiegel, 2011; Carnevale and Choi, 2000). In the view of Carnevale and Choi (2000, p.106) and Londoño Lázaro (2003, p. 334), ‘cultural ties to a mediator may be a positivefactor in international mediation’ as mediators can then bridge intercultural coordinationand communication gaps between disputants (see also Bercovitch and Foulkes, 2012; Blockand Siegel, 2011; Cohen, 1996). Conversely, it is difficult to achieve positive outcomeswithout common norms and perceptions – i.e. in an environment with severe culturaldifferences and the absence of a common identity between the disputants and the mediator.As Leng and Regan (2003, p. 436) emphasise, ‘there is a greater degree of rapport and trust1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_queryBARRIERS TO COORDINATION 5© 2015 The Authors. Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015[credibility] when the mediator and parties are from the same social or political culture, asopposed to when they are not’ (see also Bercovitch and Foulkes, 2012; Block and Siegel,2011; Carnevale and Choi, 2000). Kydd (2006, p. 459) similarly states that ‘mediationworks best when the parties and the mediators share some bonds’. For example, Iran andIraq only accepted a mediation offer from Algeria, which arguably shares several culturalcharacteristics with these two belligerents, during the war in 1982 (Princen, 1987, p. 350).Second, culture affects the costs that are associated with coordination. Cultural dissimi-larities restrain coordination, make it more costly and, thus, signal that a mediator might beless suitable and effective if differences do exist (see also Bercovitch and Foulkes, 2012;Block and Siegel, 2011; Carnevale and Choi, 2000): ‘[I]f the assumptions of disputantsregarding the role of the mediator are different from the mediator’s own views, the lattermay employ tactics that are ineffective, or even offensive’ (Leng and Regan, 2003, p. 434).Effortless coordination between the parties, on the other hand, helps facilitating thedecision-making process and, as a result, makes mediation generally less costly (see, e.g.Lohmann, 2011). We argue that shared cultural characteristics can bridge the dividebetween the mediators and the belligerents, and can smooth both the beginning and theprogress of mediation, while dissimilar cultural characteristics might well hamper coordi-nation. Due to cultural ties, a mediator simply has better access to the belligerents, makingthem more likely to deliver positions and agreements that facilitate mediation effectiveness(Bercovitch and Foulkes, 2012; Carnevale and Choi, 2000, p. 108).4 The third-partyintervention in the 1999 Kosovo conflict may illustrate this (Kydd, 2003, p. 597). Russia,a culturally close partner of Serbia, was the only mediator capable of convincing Milosevicto accept a NATO peace proposal. A culturally more distant mediator would have hadmore problems due to a more difficult access, lack of shared norms and more costlycoordination between the actors.Ultimately, we contend that a shared culture language between the antagonists and athird party raises the likelihood that mediators are accepted in the first place and moreeffective, as they can guarantee credibility due to a shared identity and lower coordinationcosts during the negotiations:5H2: The higher the cultural distance between the belligerents and the mediator, the less likelyit is that they agree on mediation (occurrence) and, if it does occur, that it is successful(outcome).The Interaction of Belligerents’ and Mediators’ Cultural TiesWe finally argue that the two factors – belligerents’ cultural similarities and the cultural tiesto the (potential) mediator – are likely to interact (see also Leng and Regan, 2003, p. 434).Specifically, we argue for a joint effect of both variables that leads to an even stronger impacton mediation, and for a conditional effect to the extent that belligerents’ cultural similaritiescondition the impact of the antagonists’ cultural ties with the mediator on the prospects formediation occurrence and effectiveness.First, while the previous sections focused on the individual effects of our core variables,it is likely that the impact of culture is complementary – i.e. belligerents’ culturalsimilarities should facilitate mediation even more positively when cultural similarities with(potential) mediators do exist as well. To illustrate this, imagine that two belligerents i and1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_query44bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6 ZORZETA BAKAKI, TOBIAS BÖHMELT AND VINCENZO BOVE© 2015 The Authors. Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015j are connected through cultural similarities. Our argument outlined above predicts thatthis should increase the chances of mediation and facilitate effective outcomes. We shouldobserve this outcome as well if cultural similarity with a third party is given. In addition,however, regardless of these independent effects, we argue to consider these effects jointlyas there might be a complementary impact of both factors: coordination among the partiesmay be even more facilitated as compared to a case where only one of the two similaritiesis given. For instance, the cultural similarity of all actors involved in the Beagle Conflictof 1978 not only made it more likely that mediation occurred, but also was effective(Garrett, 1985): Argentina and Chile shared the same cultural-religious aspect of Catholi-cism, and they also had this in common with the Vatican as the eventual mediator. In theabsence of only one of these cultural similarity relationships, the prospects for (successful)mediation might have been lower:H3: The joint impact of (1) cultural similarity between the belligerents and (2) between themand the mediator should even more increase the likelihood of mediation (occurrence) and, ifit does occur, success (outcome).Second, we argue for a conditional effect: if a high cultural distance characterises thefighting parties, it is implied that the mediator can be culturally similar to only one of them.Put differently, if i and j do not have strong cultural links with each other, one of thesemust have by definition only weak cultural ties to the (potential) mediator. This pointsdirectly to the bias literature. Generally, a mediator is seen as biased if he or she has linksor shares preferences with one of the antagonists, but not the other one, and unbiased ifhe or she remains impartial or neutral (Kydd, 2006). Kydd (2003), for instance, argues thata mediator must be biased toward a disputing party if they want the antagonists to perceivethem as an honest and credible communicator. Similarly, Savun (2008) finds support forher argument that biased mediators increase the chances of successful mediation as they arethe only third party that can credibly provide information about the belligerents. Althoughshe focuses on mediation effectiveness, Savun (2008) claims that the same factors thatdetermine mediation outcomes will influence whether we see mediation in the first place.However, Smith and Stam (2003) contend that biased mediators are not effective andRauchhaus (2006) obtains evidence that although biased mediators may be effective,impartial mediators are even more so. In a similar vein, Kydd (2006) discovers that if amediator is to help resolve a conflict caused by mutual mistrust, it must be unbiased.Ultimately, on the one hand, scholars argue that impartiality makes the mediator moreattractive because this raises his or her credibility and the trust between the mediator andthe antagonists in the context of coordination; while this makes impartial mediators morelikely to attract mediation, a neutral mediator might turn out to be more effective as well(see also Kleiboer, 1996, p. 365; Ott, 1972; Young, 1967, p. 80). Note that this argu-mentation also points to the joint effect we argued for in our third hypothesis (i.e. since thebelligerents are culturally close to each other, a mediator might be either culturally close ordistant, but he or she can never be biased towards one of them). On the other hand, studieschallenge the concept of an impartial mediator and suggest instead that biased intermedi-aries are more effective in resolving a conflict since they are more credible when providinginformation (see also Pruitt, 1981). It is undisputed by this stream in the literature,1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_queryBARRIERS TO COORDINATION 7© 2015 The Authors. Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 20152bs_bs_queryhowever, that a biased mediator may find it more difficult to be mutually accepted by thebelligerents in the first place (Crescenzi et al., 2011). In other words, conditional on thecultural ties between the belligerents, it may well be that third parties’ culture affectsmediation not as expected in our unconditional hypothesis above. We thus seek to test inour last hypothesis:H4: Belligerents’ cultural similarities affect the impact that cultural ties between the antagonistand the potential mediator have on mediation occurrence and effectiveness.Research DesignDataFor the empirical test of our hypotheses, we use cross-sectional data from the ICOWproject (Hensel et al., 2008), which cover territorial claims in the Western Hemisphere andWestern Europe, river claims in the previous two regions plus the Middle East, andmaritime claims in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. The advantages of the ICOWdata are twofold: first, we can compare cases across various issues of contention; andsecond, our analysis is not limited to situations that become militarised at some point, thusaddressing to some extent the problem of selection bias.We use ‘the potential mediator for each year of a dyadic claim as the unit of analysis’(Crescenzi et al., 2011, p. 1081). Specifically, after focusing on the ongoing years of adispute claim between a challenger and a target (i.e. the belligerents), there is a newobservation for every potential third-party state that may intervene in a given year. Apotential mediator is defined as any state from the same conflict region or a major poweras classified by the Correlates of War Project (Crescenzi et al., 2011, p. 1081). As Crescenziet al. (2011) point out, all states could in principle be considered potential mediators,although this choice would bias the dependent variable’s values towards 0. Hence, a moreparsimonious sample is warranted. With this setup, our data comprise 237,335 observationsover the period 1817–2000.6Dependent Variables and MethodologyFor capturing the concept of mediation, we rely on Bercovitch et al. (1991, p. 8; see alsoTouval and Zartman, 1985). Hence, after dropping cases that experienced military inter-ventions or bilateral conflict management, the final data include information aboutattempts to manage or settle each ICOW claim through peaceful third-party mediations.7The first dependent variable, Mediation Occurrence, receives the value of 1 if a potentialmediator actually intervened in a specific year for a dyad-claim and 0 otherwise; the seconddependent variable, Mediation Outcome, is coded 1 if mediation led at least to an agreementbetween the belligerents in a year under study and 0 otherwise (see also Crescenzi et al.,2011, p. 1081).8Various studies in the literature on international mediation indicate that there may beproblems of selection bias. The decision to mediate is itself a strategic consideration and,thus, there are many underlying factors that are likely to influence both the decision tomediate and mediation effectiveness (Böhmelt, 2010; Crescenzi et al., 2011; Gartner, 2011;Gartner and Bercovitch, 2006). Ultimately, we face a selection problem that may either1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8 ZORZETA BAKAKI, TOBIAS BÖHMELT AND VINCENZO BOVE© 2015 The Authors. Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 20153bs_bs_queryunder-estimate the impact of our explanatory variables or exaggerate it. Regular probitmodels, which might be the obvious choice given our dichotomous dependent variables,may yield biased estimates if selection is an issue, though. In order to deal with this problemin more depth, we use a probit-type Heckman selection model (Heckman, 1979). Afterassessing this model, however, we move to regular probit regression models to examine ourexpectations on mediation occurrence more thoroughly.Explanatory VariablesThe theory focuses on the cultural distance between the belligerents, on the one hand, andtheir cultural ties to the (potential) mediator, on the other. To this end, we adoptKandogan’s (2012) revised variable of Kogut and Singh’s (1988) standardised measure ofcultural differences. This variable is more accurate than previously used measures of cultureas it moves beyond simple indicators of common religion, similar languages or politicalsystems. In more detail, while the degree of cultural differences is notably difficult toconceptualise, Kogut and Singh (1998) offer a simple and standardised measure of culturaldifferences that is based on Hofstede’s (1980) dimensions of national culture. Hofstede(1980) provides a powerful framework to classify cultures that circumvents the intricaciesof culture (Kirkman, Lowe, and Gibson, 2006). Similar to our approach above, Hofstede(1980, p. 25) defines culture as ‘the collective programming of the mind which distin-guishes the members of one human group from another’. A ‘group’ can refer to nations,regions, ethnicities, religions, occupations, organisations or gender. He then classifiedcountries along four main anthropological issue areas that societies handle differently: theways of coping with inequality, the ways of coping with uncertainty, the relationship ofthe individual with his or her primary group, and the implications of having been bornfemale or male. In turn, Hofstede translated these into four dimensions of national culture:power distance – i.e. the strength of social hierarchy; uncertainty avoidance – i.e. the discomfortwith uncertainty and ambiguity; masculinity versus femininity – i.e. preferences for achieve-ment, heroism, assertiveness and material rewards for success versus cooperation, modesty,caring for the weak and quality of life; and individualism versus collectivism – i.e. preferencesfor a loosely knit social framework in which individuals are expected to take care of onlythemselves and their families in contrast to preferences for a society in which individualsexpect members of a particular in-group to look after them in exchange for loyalty.These dimensions of national cultures are rooted in people’s values, where ‘values’ are‘broad preferences for one state of affairs over others ... they are opinions on how thingsare and they also affect our behavior’ (Hofstede, 1985, p. 347). As such, by explicitly takinginto account the values held by the majority of the population in each of the surveyedcountries, these dimensions can effectively capture differences between countries in theirnorms, perceptions and ways of dealing with conflicting situations. Higher cultural distancepertains to higher divergence in opinions, norms or values. As we argue above, this should,in turn, affect the odds of mediation occurrence and success.Against this background, Kogut and Singh (1988) developed a composite index based onthe deviation from each of Hofstede’s (1980) four dimensions of national culture. Theirmeasure has been applied to studies on foreign investment expansion, entry mode choicesor the performance of foreign invested affiliates, among others (e.g. Shenkar, 2001).1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_query44bs_bs_querybs_bs_queryBARRIERS TO COORDINATION 9© 2015 The Authors. Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 20154bs_bs_queryKandogan (2012) revised the original variable by moving beyond the assumption in Kogutand Singh (1988) that the covariance between the four different dimensions of culture is0. In order to take into account the skewed distribution of this time-invariant variable, wecalculated the natural log. For the belligerents’ cultural distance (Belligerents’ CulturalDistance), we use this log-transformed variable, while we rely on a ‘weakest-link’ specifi-cation for the cultural ties of the fighting parties to the (potential) mediator (CulturalDistance) – i.e. the value of this cultural distance variable is determined by the culturaldistance of the culturally closest belligerent-mediator combination: after merging thecultural distance between the challenger belligerent and the potential mediator, and thedistance between the target belligerent and the potential mediator, we compared the valuesand only introduce the value of the lower cultural distance into the models.9 Note that thisoperationalisation underlines our claim that there must be a biased mediator when theantagonists are culturally distant from each other. In order to capture the interactive effectsbetween these two variables (as stated in our third and fourth hypothesis), we also considera multiplicative term between Belligerents’ Cultural Distance and Cultural Distance.In terms of the control variables, we consider a broad set of demand and supply-sidefactors. We list these controls and a short description of their operationalisation/source inTable 1. For a more detailed overview, in particular their underlying theoretical mecha-nisms, we refer the interested reader to the previous literature that discusses these factors indepth – e.g. Beardsley (2008; 2010), Böhmelt (2010; 2013), Crescenzi et al. (2011),Hellman (2012), or Wallensteen and Svensson (2014).Table 2 summarises the descriptive statistics of all variables discussed so far as well as thevariation inflation factors (VIFs) of the explanatory factors. Two issues are worth noting.First, according to the VIFs, multicollinearity is unlikely to be a major issue since all VIFsare well below the common threshold value of 5. Second, the occurrence of mediation isa rare event: less than 1 per cent of all observations have actually seen this form ofthird-party intervention in the full sample, while this frequency does also not changesubstantially in that sample, which is only covered by our core explanatory variables. Whilethis is driven by the unit of analysis, it follows from this that the effects we will identify arelikely to be small in substance.Empirical FindingsTable 3 summarises our results: model 1 is based on the probit-type Heckman selectionmodel (Heckman, 1979), while models 2–3 are regular probit models. Hence, while model1 jointly analyses mediation occurrence and effectiveness, models 2–3 only focus onmediation occurrence. The difference between model 2 and model 3 is the inclusion of theinteraction between Cultural Distance and Belligerents’ Cultural Distance in the latter.10Beginning with a discussion of our core variables of interest – Belligerents’ CulturalDistance and Cultural Distance – both variables are insignificant in the outcome equation ofthe Heckman-type probit model. Therefore, it is unlikely that cultural similarities affect theprospects of mediation success. Unreported models that include an interactive termbetween our core variables in the outcome equation point to the same conclusion: culturalties, either between the belligerents or to the mediator, are unlikely to affect mediationeffectiveness. This mirrors previous findings by, e.g. Inman et al.

Note, moreover, that our estimate for the ρ parameteris positive and statistically significant. This suggests that unobserved features that increasethe likelihood of selection (i.e. mediation occurrence) also increase the probability ofmediation success.However, because of the insignificant coefficient estimates of Belligerents’ CulturalDistance and Cultural Distance in the selection model’s outcome equation, we focus on theregular probit models for the occurrence of mediation.11 As coefficients in such non-linearmodels cannot be interpreted as slopes or elasticities (only their signs and standard errorsallow for a direct reading), we present substantive quantities of interest – i.e. first differenceestimates for Mediation Occurrence = 1 as one explanatory variable changes values from itsminimum to its maximum, while all others items are held constant at their medians (Kinget al., 2000). These calculations are presented in Table 4.When focusing on the results from model 2, contrary to our expectations, Belligerents’Cultural Distance actually has a positive first difference that is statistically significant atconventional levels: the chances of mediation occurrence increase by 0.07 percentagepoints when Belligerents’ Cultural Distance is raised from its minimum to its maximum. OnlyCultural Distance has the expected negative sign: the higher the cultural dissimilaritybetween the belligerents and the mediator, the less likely it is that mediation occurs.Table 2: Descriptive Statistics and Variation Inflation FactorsVariable Observations Mean Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum VIFMediation Outcome 237,335 0.002 0.043 0 1Mediation Occurrence 237,335 0.003 0.053 0 1Mediator Polity 237,335 0.675 6.559 −10 10 1.18Global Democracy 237,335 3.471 0.946 0.833 5.130 1.46Belligerents’ Polity 222,150 −0.187 6.709 −10 10 1.44Shared IO Membership 237,335 1.556 1.111 0 4 1.66Trade Bias 237,335 0.900 1.214 −3.443 5.247 1.36Alliance Bias 237,335 0.241 0.280 0 1.587 1.25Distance 237,335 3.080 0.995 0 4.079 1.08Relative Capabilities 237,335 56.091 485.263 0.000 17,002.110 1.10Mediator CINC 237,335 0.024 0.051 0.000 0.384 1.06Previous Mediations 237,335 0.267 1.500 0 23 2.01Previous MediationsSame Mediator237,335 0.028 0.294 0 6 1.14Non-State Interventions 237,335 0.186 0.716 0 7 1.92Issue Salience 237,335 6.457 2.414 0 12 1.15Maritime Dispute 237,335 0.403 0.491 0 1 1.54River Dispute 237,335 0.050 0.219 0 1 1.17Belligerents’ CulturalDistance164,821 9.473 1.026 6.001 11.010 1.37Mediator CulturalDistance153,071 9.357 0.954 6.001 11.378 1.131bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_query44bs_bs_querybs_bs_query45bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12 ZORZETA BAKAKI, TOBIAS BÖHMELT AND VINCENZO BOVE© 2015 The Authors.

Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015Substantially, the likelihood of mediation occurrence decreases by 0.06 percentage pointswhen Cultural Distance is raised from its minimum to its maximum. Both findings areconsistent with our estimates of the selection equation in the Heckman-type probit model.In absolute terms, these first-difference estimates appear to be very small, but recall thatmediation occurrence is a rare event in our dataset (less than 1 per cent of all observationshave seen mediation). This induces that our substantial quantities estimated by anystatistical model are automatically very small. Overall, our first hypothesis must be rejected,while we obtain some support for our second one: our expectations regarding occurrenceare met, but not in terms of effectiveness. We return to these findings in the last section.In addition, regarding the third and fourth hypothesis, while we could not obtainsupport for an interactive effect in terms of mediation effectiveness (see above), there isevidence for an interactive relationship for mediation occurrence (model 3). Since wecannot directly interpret the size, signs and z-statistics of the components of a multipli-cative specification, we calculated average marginal effects for Belligerents’ Cultural Distanceaccording to Cultural Distance and vice versa (Braumoeller, 2004, p. 815). Figure 1 depictsour findings.As this figure shows, the marginal impact of either variable is decreasing with the valuesof the other measure of cultural distance. Interestingly, however, Belligerents’ CulturalDistance largely remains at positive values independent from the values of Cultural DistanceTable 4: First Difference Estimates (Model 2)First difference estimate CI lower bound CI upper boundMediator Polity 0.03 0.00 0.06Global Democracy 0.17 0.12 0.23Belligerents’ Polity −0.07 −0.10 −0.04Shared IO Membership 0.03 −0.01 0.07Trade Bias 0.09 0.03 0.16Alliance Bias 0.11 0.02 0.23Distance −0.75 −0.94 −0.58Relative Capabilities −0.09 −0.11 −0.06Mediator CINC 8.42 6.82 10.13Previous Mediations 62.86 33.34 86.77Previous Mediations Same Mediator 4.08 2.19 6.54Non-State Interventions −0.09 −0.11 −0.07Issue Salience 0.24 0.16 0.33Maritime Dispute 0.01 −0.02 0.03River Dispute −0.06 −0.08 −0.02Belligerents’ Cultural Distance 0.07 0.03 0.12Cultural Distance −0.06 −0.12 −0.01Notes: Simulated estimates are based on 1,000 draws from a multivariate normal distribution; CI pertains to confidence interval;bounds are based on 90 per cent confidence intervals.

Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015(left panel), although there is a negative slope. Hence, the intervening impact of CulturalDistance seems actually rather weak, as the positive and unconditional impact of Belligerents’Cultural Distance we identified in model 2 remains robust. In other words, we do not findsupport for our third hypothesis as there is no evidence for a joint effect. Moreover, theright panel in Figure 1 models the impact of Cultural Distance conditional on Belligerents’Cultural Distance – i.e. this constitutes the test for our fourth hypothesis at the mediationoccurrence stage. While we observe an insignificant impact for low to moderate culturaldistances between the antagonists, the marginal effect of Cultural Distance becomes negativeand significant when the cultural distance between the fighting parties is large. Thisconfirms our expectation that a conditional effect between the two culture variables exists:when the belligerents are dissimilar from each other, but the mediator is quite similar toone of them, the mediator must be dissimilar from the other fighting party. This findingthat mediation is more likely to occur when the belligerents are dissimilar but the mediatorhas low cultural distance with the nearest belligerent mirrors prototypical bias. This mightappear counterintuitive at first sight, but it can be explained with the literature on mediatorbias: if a mediator is biased toward either side, the non-favoured fighting party doesapparently not have many incentives to argue against this mediator, but perceives them –also in the shadow of prospective mediation success – as sufficient to help settling a conflict.Figure 1: The Interaction of Cultural Distance (Model 3): (a) Impact of Belligerents’Cultural Distance on Probability of Mediation and (b) Impact of Cultural Distance onProbability of MediationNote: Solid line signifies average marginal effect of variable at vertical axis onMediation Occurrence; dashed lines pertain to 90 percent confidence interval; average marginal effect of 0 marked with grey horizontal line; rug plot along x-axis illustrates distributionof observations of Cultural Distance (left panel) or Belligerents’ Cultural Distance (right panel).1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_queryBARRIERS TO COORDINATION 15© 2015 The Authors. Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015Arguably, this is an ad hoc explanation, but it mirrors Kydd (2003) who claims that a biasedmediator is more likely to be effective. If this applies, it would virtually preclude the needfor a culturally neutral mediator.Coming to our control variables, when comparing our models with previous work thatrelies on the same data source, we see that the control covariates’ findings largely matchprevious results both in substance and coefficient signs. First, the more democratic apotential mediator, the more likely it is that he or she is accepted as an intervener, but theless likely it is that they perform mediation effectively. Second, the more democratic theinternational community, the higher the chances that mediation is effective. We find asimilarly positive result in terms of mediation occurrence, which mirrors Mitchell’s (2002)argument that the peaceful resolution of disputes is facilitated by global democratic values.Third, democracies are less likely to use mediation for settling issues (e.g. Ellis et al., 2010),while they are also less likely to reach effective outcomes. Fourth, the membership ininternational institutions with conflict resolution mechanisms is unlikely to influencemediation outcomes or the likelihood of mediation occurrence.Both Trade Bias and Alliance Bias seem to increase the chances that we will observemediation: the two variables are positively signed and statistically significant in the estimationsof Mediation Occurrence, either in the Heckman setup or the regular probit models. In linewith our findings for the fourth hypothesis (Kydd, 2003; Crescenzi et al., 2011, p. 1086), thisactually points to the conclusion that belligerents may not necessarily opt for impartial – i.e.neutral interveners. Instead, in light of the better prospects for mediation success, biasedmediators are already preferred at the selection stage. Consistently, the alliance and trade biasvariables have positively signed coefficients also in the outcome equation on mediationeffectiveness, although only the former is significant at conventional levels.The larger the geographical distance between a potential mediator and the target state,the less likely it is that the former actually intervenes. While this finding is based on therationale that geographically close states have a more vivid security interest for settlingconflicts in their neighbourhood and, thus, may have higher chances of getting involvedin the first place, model 1 does not suggest that Distance affects mediation outcomes.Relative Capabilities has the expected negative effect on both mediation occurrence andmediation outcomes. The variable is also significant in either equation. Hence, the moreasymmetric the capabilities to the extent that the challenger has more military leverage athis or her disposal, the less likely it is that mediation will be accepted as the challenger canpursue their interests more effectively with military means (Mason and Fett, 1996, p. 550;Young, 1967).Mediation is more likely to occur and supposedly more effective when the mediator hasa higher rank (or is more powerful) and the more important an issue is from the perspectiveof the belligerents. While Mediator CINC is in fact a very strong predictor in both stagesof the Heckman-type probit model and in the regular probit estimations, Issue Salience ispositively signed, but reaches conventional levels of significance only when focusing on theoccurrence of mediation. Note, however, that this mirrors Gartner (2011, p. 386), whoclaims that ‘certain types of disputes are less conducive to management, but once condi-tions change to induce mediation, these conflict characteristics have less influence onagreement durability’.1bs_bs_querybs_bs_query2bs_bs_querybs_bs_query3bs_bs_querybs_bs_query4bs_bs_querybs_bs_query5bs_bs_querybs_bs_query6bs_bs_querybs_bs_query7bs_bs_querybs_bs_query8bs_bs_querybs_bs_query9bs_bs_querybs_bs_query10bs_bs_querybs_bs_query11bs_bs_querybs_bs_query12bs_bs_querybs_bs_query13bs_bs_querybs_bs_query14bs_bs_querybs_bs_query15bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16bs_bs_querybs_bs_query17bs_bs_querybs_bs_query18bs_bs_querybs_bs_query19bs_bs_querybs_bs_query20bs_bs_querybs_bs_query21bs_bs_querybs_bs_query22bs_bs_querybs_bs_query23bs_bs_querybs_bs_query24bs_bs_querybs_bs_query25bs_bs_querybs_bs_query26bs_bs_querybs_bs_query27bs_bs_querybs_bs_query28bs_bs_querybs_bs_query29bs_bs_querybs_bs_query30bs_bs_querybs_bs_query31bs_bs_querybs_bs_query32bs_bs_querybs_bs_query33bs_bs_querybs_bs_query34bs_bs_querybs_bs_query35bs_bs_querybs_bs_query36bs_bs_querybs_bs_query37bs_bs_querybs_bs_query38bs_bs_querybs_bs_query39bs_bs_querybs_bs_query40bs_bs_querybs_bs_query41bs_bs_querybs_bs_query42bs_bs_querybs_bs_query43bs_bs_querybs_bs_query44bs_bs_querybs_bs_query16 ZORZETA BAKAKI, TOBIAS BÖHMELT AND VINCENZO BOVE© 2015 The Authors. Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015All remaining control variables are used in the selection equation of the probit-typeHeckman or the regular probit models only. In short, there is a negative impact of RiverDispute (territorial conflicts constitute the baseline): territorial issue claims are likely tocause the most intense conflicts (Hensel et al., 2008) and, hence, may be most in need tobe mediated – at least more than river claims; the impact of Maritime Claims is insignificant.Finally, the controls for previous mediation efforts all suggest the following: the moreprevious mediation efforts over the course of an issue claim, independent from whetherthese previous mediations come from any mediator, the same third party, or an interna-tional organisation, the more likely it is that mediation occurs again (see also Böhmelt,2013).Discussion and ConclusionWhich factors influence mediation occurrence? What drives the outcome of third-partymediation? The previous quantitative literature identified culture as a crucial element foranswering these questions, but mainly focused on the cultural ties between the belligerents.We sought to contribute to this literature by providing a thorough analysis of the culturalrelationships that form the triangle of two belligerents and the (potential) mediator.Our theoretical framework reviewed the existing research on belligerents’ culture anddeveloped new arguments: according to our theory, the larger the cultural distancebetween the belligerents, and between them and the mediator, the less likely it is thatmediation occurs. Shared cultural features induce a common identity and fewer coordi-nation costs. This makes it more likely that the actors involved agree on mediation and thatit is more effective.However, we found that the larger the cultural distance between the belligerents, themore likely it is that mediation occurs. Also, cultural similarities between the belligerentsand the potential mediator do not necessarily guarantee the effectiveness of the mediationattempt: cultural characteristics may affect the selection level of mediation, but notnecessarily the outcome. Finally, although we obtained evidence for an interactive effectbetween our culture variables (third and fourth hypothesis), only our expectations assummarised in the fourth hypothesis could partly be confirmed: cultural ties between theantagonists condition the impact of the cultural links to the mediator on mediation occur-rence, but not effectiveness.What explains the discrepancy between mediation occurrence and mediation effective-ness in terms of the impact of our variables? First, a potential explanation is given byFearon’s (1994, p. 240) distinction between general and immediate deterrence. The formerpertains to situations in which no threats are immediately issued, but the actors involvedgenerally compete over some issue (or are in an adversarial relationship); the latter pertainsto situations in which real threats have been issued or force has been used. Due to aself-selection mechanism into situations of immediate deterrence (see also Fearon, 2002),which involves prior beliefs about adversaries’ willingness to use force, the core implicationof Fearon’s (1994, p. 245) work is that ‘hypotheses that are true for general deterrence maybe exactly reversed for immediate deterrence’.

Actors’ prior beliefs about the likely effectiveness of an actor, which is determined,among other characteristics, by common cultural features, could turn out to be wrong afterthe occurrence of mediation has taken place. If subscribing to this claim, mediation stillinvolves several stages that are highly interrelated, but some factors such as our culturevariables may in fact be unrelated to what happens after we have seen the occurrence ofthird-party intervention. In essence, this mirrors the argumentation in Inman et al. (2014,p. 8).Moreover, the result that greater cultural distance between antagonists makes mediationmore likely deviates from the existent findings on culture, but is actually consistent withother findings on democracy and mediation. Specifically, one of the most important normsof democracies is the peaceful resolution of conflicts. This should make democraticbelligerents more likely to agree on mediation (e.g. Raymond, 1994). Other studies cometo the opposite conclusion, however: democracies are more likely to use bilateral nego-tiations for settling issues (e.g. Ellis et al., 2010). The basic argument here states thatdemocracies are able to strike effective bargains without third-party influence on their own(Ellis et al., 2010, p. 376). These patterns may well apply to cultural similarities too: thesmaller the cultural distance between belligerents, the less in need are these actors formediation. In turn, this also decreases the chances that we see this particular form ofthird-party conflict resolution.Several avenues for further research do exist. We outline two of them. First, althoughwe provided explanations for those findings that go against our hypotheses and for thediscrepancy between mediation occurrence and effectiveness, future research may want toexamine these issues more thoroughly. Second, despite the innovative nature of ourcultural variables, they are macro measures that capture cultural characteristics at thenational level. Several parts of our theoretical framework, however, rely on micro-levelarguments that focus on the individual. A more thorough investigation of these claims, alsoin light of the existent psychology literature, seems necessary.(Accepted: 17 November 2014)About the AuthorsZorzeta Bakaki obtained her PhD in Political Science from the University of Essex in 2014 and since then has beenworking as a Postdoctoral Researcher at ETH Zürich.

Political Studies © 2015 Political Studies AssociationPOLITICAL STUDIES: 2015Notes1 Claims are identified according to explicit evidence of contention involving official representatives of two or more nation statesover the issue type in question (Hensel et al., 2008).2 There is also a broad psychology literature on culture and mediation. Inman et al. (2014) and Leng and Regan (2003) providean excellent review of these studies and we refer the interested reader to this work.3 Leng and Regan (2003), Carnevale and Choi (2000) and Bercovitch and Foulkes (2012) are noteworthy exceptions here.However, while Leng and Regan (2003) only focus on regime type and religion as cultural ties, which somewhat limits the scopeof their study, Carnevale and Choi (2000) and Bercovitch and Foulkes (2012) do not provide an empirical analysis for theirargument.4 Inman et al. (2014, p. 7) focus primarily on the cultural ties between the belligerents and only refer to cultural links to the mediatorindirectly. In essence, these scholars claim that culture affects belligerents’ ‘perceptions of and reactions to mediator bias’ (Inmanet al., 2014, p. 7). Against this background, it is claimed that a biased mediator may be deterrent to mediation, leading to theexpectation that only culturally similar belligerents are able to agree on some mediator as this avoids that the third party will bebiased towards either side: the farther the belligerents are culturally apart, ‘the greater the potential cultural difference betweenthe mediators and parties, thereby increasing the likelihood that at least one of the states will view mediation as potentially biasedand reject it’ (Inman et al., 2014, p. 7). Note, however, that even this indirect claim is not tested in their study.5 This argumentation corresponds to some degree to Svensson and Lindgren’s treatment of internal mediators – i.e. third partiesthat come from inside a conflict (region). In fact, internal mediators benefit from a high degree of trust from the disputants thatis predetermined by their connectedness to the conflict (Svensson and Lindgren, 2013, p. 701). Their status as ‘insiders’ gives them‘intimate knowledge of the conflict and unique entry points for mediation through and accumulated trust of not one, but all sides’(Svensson and Lindgren, 2013, p. 701). Svensson and Lindgren (2013) argue that all these properties that are likely to promotemediation occurrence and effectiveness primarily stem from the ‘same social context’ of the parties involved.6 Note that due to missing values for our core explanatory variables, the sample decreases to 111,956 observations over the sameperiod.7 This basically treats mediation in the broadest possible way by including all kinds of voluntary third-party interventions – i.e. goodoffices, inquiries, conciliations, classical mediations, arbitrations, adjunctions, multilateral negotiations and international peaceconferences. A potential problem with that approach, however, is that it considers both limited forms of mediation and heavymediations such as arbitration and adjunction, which employ more forceful means (Rauchhaus, 2006, p. 224). We return to thisissue in the robustness section of the online appendix. Moreover, the appendix also outlines the results from an analysis on asample that includes bilateral negotiations.8 This is the only outcome variable that is offered by the ICOW data and, consequently, we have to rely on this effectivenessmeasure. That said, Beardsley (2008) argues that any ‘agreement variable’ essentially captures short to mid-term effectiveness only,while long-term effectiveness would focus on the recurrence of conflict.9 We also considered a series of alternative specifications. We discuss these in the online appendix.10 The interaction term is only included in the regular probit model discussed. When including a multiplicative term in theHeckman-type probit model’s outcome equation, we find no evidence for a joint or conditional effect. Hence, this questions ourclaims regarding mediation effectiveness. To save space, we omit this table from the presentation, but the results can be replicatedwith our data material.11 Note that Cultural Distance may be endogenous to mediation outcomes. The variable Belligerents’ Cultural Distance is not affectedby this as it is truly exogenous, though (i.e. it cannot be ‘chosen’ as it is predetermined by the conflict). For example, there mightbe greater supply/demand for certain cultural distances to the mediator depending on the prospects for resolution. The Heckmanmodel controls for this to some extent due to the selection equation, which directly models whether culture matters for the initialchoice of mediation, and this information is fed into the outcome equation. However, sample selection may lead to, but isgenerally different from, endogeneity bias. In general, sample selection refers to problems where the outcome variable of interestis observed only for a restricted, non-random sample. This basically applies to our case – and we control for this with Heckmanprobit. On the other hand, endogeneity bias refers to situations in which an explanatory variable included in the model may bea choice variable that is correlated with unobservables in the error term. This means for our work that we cannot fully rule outthe possibility of Cultural Distance being endogenous to mediation outcomes. And this might be the reason why we do not findmuch of an effect for this variable in the outcome equation. However, replacing the Heckman model with a possibly moresuitable estimation strategy (bivariate probit regression; see Beardsley, 2008) leads to the same results as reported in Table 3. Wethank an anonymous reviewer for highlighting this.Supporting InformationAdditional Supporting Information can be found in the online version of this article at thepublisher’s website:Appendix S1: Robustness checks.ReferencesAugsburger, D.
