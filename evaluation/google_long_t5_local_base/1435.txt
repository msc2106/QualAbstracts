FULL TEXT: 
 GDP and household income on unemployment rate was highlighted, whilst various determinants of port potentials were investigated on whether they stimulate port potentials. KEYWORDS: seaports; employment; labour economics; South Korea INTRODUCTION Given the interwoven relationship between port and region, it may be difficult to argue that the port either solely determines the region’s economy or that the region solely governs the port’s vitalisation. The changing port-regional employment relationships and geography are highly related to wider processes of economic restructuring, the appearance of global chains as well as production networks (HALL and ROBBINS, 2007b). Although much literature has examined the impact of the port on its region’s economy or on local employment, the link between them is still open to debate, providing a chance for further research (DUCRUET et al., 2015). Some studies found that there are no strong relationships between the ports and cities. Although container volumes have increased in big cities globally over the last few decades, the correlation between container volumes and city size has considerably decreased because of regional competition and local constraints (DUCRUET and LEE, 2006). In other words, more dispersed hinterland areas act as a platform for production and consumption once the economic, infrastructural and institutional links between ports and cities have been untied, despite the fact that prior to containerisation, ports used to be closely related to an identifiable port-city and hinterland (HALL, 2008). Furthermore, DUCRUET (2009) claimed that the growth of traffic in the tertiary regions is higher than in industrial regions in advanced countries owing to globalisation. In this regard, HALL (2004) ascertained that some port studies may exaggerate the economic impact of ports. Empirical research pertaining to the role of ports on local employment has been mostly investigated in the EU and US, and recently China and South Africa (e.g. MUSSO et al., 2000; ACCIARO, 2008; HALL, 2008; FERRARI et al., 2010; COTO-MILLAN et al., 2010; HALL and JACOBS, 2010; BOTTASSO et al., 2013; FAGEDA and GONZALEZ-AREGALL, 2014; SONG and VAN GEENHUIZEN, 2014). Since the economic and spatial development of ports varies between countries (e.g. developed vs developing; Western vs Eastern) (LEE et al., 2008), the above previous port impact studies may be unable to universally reflect or explain the economic role of ports in South Korea (hereafter Korea). The international trade of Korea has relied heavily on shipping, thereby resulting in importance of port cities such as Busan, Incheon and Gwangyang (DUCRUET et al., 2012a). Busan port benefits from deep water, a large population and the government’s active support, helping Busan to facilitate its city with the biggest port in Korea (FREMONT and DUCRUET, 2005). Busan had the main container and general cargo ports prior to Gwangyang port’s emergence (FREMONT and DUCRUET, 2005). Incheon port has located adjacent to the DMZ (the Korean Demilitarised Zone), and with high tidal ranges and a lock gate system it has difficulty in nautical accessibility to accommodate large containerships (DUCRUET et al., 2012a; FREMONT and DUCRUET, 2005). As for Gwangyang port, the government has attempted to develop it as a complex logistics hub by increasing cargoes, which can be derived from the manufacturing sectors such as the petrochemistry and steel-making industries. Due to the increased necessity of systematic port policy implementation, the Korean government amended the port law in 1991, and adopted the 1st port master plan for the period between 1992-2001. The government expected a shortage of port facilities owing to a rapid increase of seaborne cargoes. Accordingly, it invested huge capital in port facilities, and induced port privatisation for improved efficiency. As for the 2nd port master plan for 2006-2011, the government anticipated fierce port competition in Northeast Asia, slowdown of the import/export cargo growth, and heightened uncertainty regarding transhipment cargoes. To cope with this circumstance, government policy pursued the development of the Northeast Asia logistics centric port, vitalisation of the port cluster, re-development of the old port, and expansion of cruise ports. Finally, the 3rd port master plan includes the improvement of port connectivity and hinterland connection, long-term cargo forecasts, port function re-configuration, port infra-and super-structure development and sustainable port-city development. The ports in Korea have played a vital role in national and regional development. The ports have handled 99.8% of the import/export cargoes in Korea, which has a high level of dependence on exports (88% in 2010) (MOF, 2014). 27 of 40 national industrial complexes include ports or are located in the vicinity of the ports (MOF, 2014). Despite their important role to Korea’s development and economies, there is little research that has examined the role of ports on local employment covering all the regions of Korea based on systematic and empirical evidence. Notably, DUCRUET et al. (2012a) examined Incheon’s transformation from port gateway to global city by identifying the association between freight and urban development. They introduced Incheon’s effort to facilitate freight transport and free economic zones, based on the concept of ‘Pentaport’. Their study contribute to offering new knowledge about how Incheon as a port city has attempted to capture and plan the heightened and elaborated flows of goods in conjunction with the national level as a whole. FREMONT and DUCRUET (2005) revealed the emergence of a mega-port city with the case of Busan. Remarkably, they found that the development and challenges of Busan port is largely determined by local factors (e.g. local congestion, coexistence of port and urban function, port competition, government responses, governance, new infrastructures, etc). Meanwhile, Park and Seo (2016) have explored the generic economic impact of ports on the regions by employing the augmented Solow growth model in Korea. However, all these studies in the Korean context overlooked the role of ports on employment. This paper fills that gap by utilising the theory of regional unemployment from labour economics in order to identify the impact of ports on employment, particularly its disparity against the national level. This study aims to examine the port’s influence on regional employment in all the 16 regions, including seven metropolitan areas by using two empirical models, the economic model of unemployment expanded from a labour economics theory and the purely-empirical autoregressive model, on panel data between 2002 and 2013. Additionally, this study employs a Tobit model in order to examine the causation between a diverse range of port potentials antecedents and port potentials in a Korean context and also to derive estimated port potentials that represent true port activities behind observed but censored activities. By doing so, this paper reveals whether the existence of ports contributes to regional employment in Korea. Particularly, this paper focuses on testing two hypotheses: H1 Regional port activity lowers regional unemployment rates in Korea; H2 Population and household income are proportional to unemployment in the port regions of Korea, but GDP is negatively related in the port regions. As for H1, it can be argued that the existence of the port fosters regional employment because it necessarily creates various jobs with the following related parties: terminal operator, shipping companies, ship’s agent, freight forwarders, pilots, tug companies, mooring companies, state administration, warehouses, inland transport operators, ship management companies, third-party logistics service providers, ship-repair yards and so on. The activities of all those parties that are necessary for the operation and the use of port facilities will generate employment, wages and salaries, gross operation surplus and gross value added, all of which in turn affect the port-local community with a multiplier effect due to their spending (MUSSO et al., 2000). This question tests the neoclassical port-city model to examine whether the presence of the port facilitates the development of regions via the use of the port, spending on relevant activities and generated income (FUJITA and MORI, 1996). Regarding H2, the Blanchard and Katz model (BLANCHARD and KATZ, 1992), the most extensive theoretical model for regional unemployment differentials (ELHORST, 2003), argue that increasing labour supply (e.g. larger population), higher household income (e.g. higher wage) and decreasing labour demand (e.g. decreasing production) are positively associated with higher regional unemployment. These questions have been a central issue in the area of labour economics (ELHORST, 2003). However, these hypotheses were not empirically tested in the port-city context. The finding of this paper will be beneficial to port policy makers, regional planners and city planners. When they make an investment for the ports, they may refer to the results of the current study, implying that their spending on ports may facilitate regional employment and flow into the citizens’ income. The remainder of this study is as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant studies, whilst Section 3 explains the methodology this paper employed. Next, the empirical result is shown in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 displays the concluding remarks. Supplemental materials can be found in the online Appendix. LITERATURE REVIEW There is a lack of consensus about the definition of a port region, which makes it difficult to compare various contexts of port regions (DUCRUET, 2009). Port regions are varied in function and importance in accordance with the continental context and traffic (DUCRUET et al., 2012b). DUCRUET (2009) noted that they are a multifaceted concept incorporating different realities such as the economic area around a port, the logistics area connecting the port (e.g. port hinterland) and the area where inter-port relationships take place (e.g. port ranges or port systems), or they can be ranged from a set of adjacent ports to the part of the hinterland with the most users of a given port (DUCRUET et al., 2015). DUCRUET (2009, p. 43) regarded a port region “as a port system or a system of two or more ports (and terminals), located in proximity within a given area, where the given ports enjoy not only geographical proximity but also functional interdependence through sharing sea and land services”. Notably, DUCRUET et al. (2012b) identified eight types of port regions via a non-hierarchical cluster analysis (on the basis of port throughput, population, unemployment, GDP, cargo specialisation, employment sectors): (1) deprived; (2) peripheral; (3) metropolitan; (4) industrial; (5) productive; (6) bulky; (7) transit; and (8) traditional port regions. In terms of the coverage of the port region, various academics have used different coverages. As for the current study, the definition of the port region (see Fig. A1) complies with the parameter of the administrative jurisdiction of each province where the port is located. This parameter might align with one of DUCRUET (2009)’s arguments that the port region is limited to the area where the economic impact of the port is dominant. Meanwhile, some academics have extensively examined the relationship between ports and cities (DUCRUET and ITOH, 2015). From the perspective of port-cities, the functions of urban and port coexist in harmony and interdependence, and share mutual goals, in particular, for economic issues (LEE et al., 2008). Port-cities, pursuing load centres, service centres and world port-cities, have attempted to lure maritime-related companies, since it may upgrade cities’ economies and fortify ports’ competitive position in the global supply chain (JACOBS et al., 2010). In turn, cities can provide the port with port-promotion support, road transport infrastructure and port-related activities. Some studies have argued that the direct impact of ports on economies and employment at the local level has been considerably reduced owing to shifts from local to global inputs, innovative cargo handling systems that reduce dependence on labour, re-location of former port-related industries, rise of production networks, port competition and reliance on the accessibility of inland transport networks (MUSSO et al., 2000; HALL, 2007a). Today, the economic advantages of ports appear more valid at national and continent levels than at infra-national levels (DUCRUET et al., 2014). DUCRUET and LEE (2006) found the weakening spatial fix at the global level by investigating the diminishing correlation between port throughput and the demographic size of the port city. Other studies uncovered the weakening relationship between port growth and urban growth (JACOBS et al., 2010) or limited correlation between port traffic and the concentration of maritime firms in world port-cities (JACOBS et al., 2011). Remarkably, DUCRUET et al. (2014) uncovered that the economic impact of the port on the region is varied according to the heterogeneous commodity flows. For the European case, they found that port regions involved in both the primary sector and agricultural commodities traffic have a sound economy, whilst the port regions based on both the industrial sector and liquid bulk commodities yield lower economy with high unemployment rates. Sometimes, cargoes simply pass through the port without stimulating employment and economic rents. For example, empirical evidence from JO and DUCRUET (2007) showed that the ports in some regions act as a mere gateway, which mainly serves inland core economic regions, resulting in low local externalities. Besides, some cities or regions located far from ports may be able to benefit from port activities due to containerisation and lowered inland transport costs (BOTASSO et al., 2013). In other words, the port region may be losing its conventional port functions, which are transferring toward new regions, which is known as ‘de-maritimisation’ (LEE et al., 2008). Interestingly, DUCRUET and ITOH (2015, p.4) pointed out that “port throughput volumes increasingly were a function of the overall centrality port nodes in the global shipping network rather than a proxy for local economic activity, especially because many of these central nodes actually emerged in less urbanised places, to avoid congestion and allow for expansion on greenfield sites”. Accordingly, the urbanised places may only possess a limited function of port activities such as advanced logistics function, and move the rest of the functions to remote ports (HAYUTH, 1981). On this point, LEE et al. (2008) noted that future growth or decline of the port may be determined by an ability to adapt to such changes. It should be noted that the economic impacts of ports may be likely to expand from port regions towards the entire areas of port users, whilst the provision of port-related space, opportunity costs for land use and negative externalities such as congestion and pollution may remain spatially concentrated in the local regions (MUSSO et al., 2000). Development of the port requires huge space from local areas, but sometimes global port operators who receive the land allocation at the port appear to be paid less than its opportunity cost, land consumption, traffic congestion, environmental issues and coast waste costs (BENACCHIO and MUSSO, 2001). Nevertheless, the impact of ports on local regions may still remain in the port regions. Also, the locations of ports often remain proximal to urban areas (DUCRUET et al., 2015). The proliferation of the port-centric logistics philosophy may help to revitalise local economies and employment by bringing more manufacturers, logistics service providers, and warehouses into the vicinity of ports. Secondly, the major expenses related to port activities can be localised into the port regions (FERRARI et al., 2006). Some large port-cities still try to maintain high degrees of port activities owing to the benefits levied by ports from urbanisation economies and the tertiary sector, notwithstanding all the physical obstacles of a dense urban environment (LEE et al., 2008). In this regard, HALL and JACOBS (2012) argued that most of the world’s important ports are still urban, which have advantages over non-urbanised areas in terms of luring and redirecting cargoes, even when these cargoes are destined for extended hinterlands. Despite the importance of the impact of ports on local employment due to the existence of possible imbalances between local and global benefits, few studies have examined this issue. BOTTASSO et al. (2013) found port throughput considerably increases the employment of the host region for manufacturing sectors, with less noticeable effect on the service industry in ten West European countries. This was based on econometrics with the estimation of a set of employment equations, enabling the consideration of persistent effects on employment, regional unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity and endogeneity of port activity. They concluded that the impact of the port on local development is weakly affected by actual volume of maritime traffic. FERRARI et al. (2010) appraised the impact of port activity on the local development of employment in Italian provinces by adopting a propensity score methodology, assuming that port output is correlated with the level of employment in the corresponding province. They concluded that port traffic growth has only a limited impact on local employment growth. HALL (2008) examined the effect of container ports on local benefits and port-logistics workers in major US port-cities since 1975 from the perspective of labour economics. A difference-in-difference framework was employed to investigate the relative annual earnings of workers in the port, trucking and warehouse, and he found that special earnings advantage no longer exists in port-logistics jobs in the major container port-city regions. On the other hand, ACCIARO (2008) uncovered that the employment effect created by the port industry is higher in the regional economy than the total national one. FAGEDA and GONZALEZ-AREGALL (2014) discovered that the employment level in the manufacturing industry is higher in port regions in the case of Spain with the spatial Durbin model. Also, COTO-MILLAN et al. (2010) searched the impact of port infrastructure on economic growth and employment in Cantabria, Spain based on econometric techniques of co-integration that may be complementary to other methods such as input-output or cost-benefit analysis, and found that an increase in port capital stock results in growth in production and in regional employment. MUSSO et al. (2000) conducted a case study by estimating the employment impact of the port of Genoa, Italy on its regional economy. In order to examine whether the employment impact on the regions is completely or partially port oriented in terms of probability, they developed a new methodology based on location quotients and control regions. Although the aforementioned studies examined the role of ports on local employment, there is little research for Korea. This study employs a two-stage approach in empirical analysis. It first estimates a Tobit model to discover port potentials, and then uses a one-way fixed-effect model for the main analysis. The next section explains the main methodology. METHODOLOGY This study develops the economic theories of unemployment into testable models, which consider censored observations and dynamic relationships, to test the following hypotheses. H1: Regional port activity lowers regional unemployment rates in Korea; H2: Population and household income are proportional to unemployment in the port regions of Korea, but GDP is negatively related in the port regions. This study addresses two main methodological limitations in the previous research. First, past studies did not utilise the development in the labour economics of regional unemployment when constructing an empirical model e.g. FERRARI et al. (2010). Second, the censoring issue in ports throughput was not tackled e.g., BOTTASSO et al. (2013) or truncation was caused otherwise by dropping non-observations e.g., ACCIARO (2008). The only exception is the study by FERRARI et al. (2010). However, they did not discuss the issue of censored regressors raised by RIGOBON and STOKER (2007) nor did they consider the dynamic relationship. Occasionally, other studies employ non-testable methods e.g., numerical ratio analysis or non-stochastic input-output analysis as in ACCIARO (2008). Theory and empirical models BLANCHARD and KATZ (1992)’ seminal paper presents a system of four equations to explain unemployment disparities across regions using labour economics theories (Appendix B1 in the Supplemental data online). According to ELHORST (2003), this system can be solved for a long-run equilibrium unemployment rate (𝑢𝑖∗) by assuming 𝑢𝑖∗ = 𝑢𝑖𝑡 = 𝑢𝑖,𝑡−1 where uit is the unemployment rate of region i in time t. 𝑢𝑖∗ =𝑎𝑎(𝑏𝑐 + 𝑔) + 𝑏𝑑 − 𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑠 −1𝑎(𝑏𝑐 + 𝑔) + 𝑏𝑑 − 𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑑 +𝑎𝑐 + 𝑑𝑎(𝑏𝑐 + 𝑔) + 𝑏𝑑 − 𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑤 (1) where a, b, c, d, g and k are positive coefficients. It can be seen that the regional unemployment rate is affected positively by non-wage labour supply determinants (xs), negatively by non-wage labour demand determinants (xd) and positively by wage-setting factors (xw). 𝑢𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑠 + 𝛽2𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑑 + 𝛽3𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑤 + 𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐩′𝛄 + 𝑒𝑖𝑡 (2) where xp is a vector of exogenous port-activity variables and γ is a vector of coefficients. The empirical null hypothesis is γ=0 and the alternative hypothesis is γ<0. The rejection of the null hypothesis will support that port activity reduces unemployment rates. The expected signs of β1, β2 and β3 are positive, negative and positive, respectively. Alternatively, the role of port activities can be examined in a dynamic model of unemployment. For example, BLANCHARD and KATZ (1992) used an autoregressive model of order 2, AR(2), assuming that all relevant information about labour supply, demand, wage and other activities are reflected in past unemployment rates. Port activities can be also added e.g. to an AR(2). 𝑢𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑢𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2𝑢𝑖,𝑡−2 + 𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐩′𝛄 + 𝑒𝑖𝑡 (3) The null hypothesis is γ=0. Significantly negative γ would indicate that port activity reduces regional unemployment rates. β1 and β2 reflect the dynamics of unemployment over time. Another important issue is how to deal with non-port regions that may have some potentials or constructed a port later in a sample period (e.g. BOTTASSO et al., 2013). This occurs because the government may not allow port construction until ‘port potentials’ (FERRARI et al., 2010) reach a certain threshold point. For example, the construction of ports may depend on a result of due-diligence of economic and social benefits. As a result, observed port activity data will be ‘left-censored’ although non-port regions may have the potential for port activities. This is similar to an unemployed worker with zero working hours but who may have the potential to work. If port potential is a true and uncensored but latent variable behind observed port activity, it can be used as a regressor (xp) in (2) and (3). Positive port potential can be interpreted as estimated port activities. Negative port potential means that the region is not ready to have a port, but its magnitude will change depending on the readiness of a region. Since less strongly negative port potential is a reflection of greater economic activities and better transport infrastructure, it can also explain varying regional unemployment. An uncensored port potential potentially have higher explanatory power as a regressor since it maintains more information than a censored counterpart. Also, the adverse impact of a censored regressor cannot be ignored. First, removing censored observations reduces efficiency in estimation and possibly leads to a bias (RIGOBON and STOKER, 2009) since it causes truncation instead. Second, if censored observations are retained, estimates will be excessively large (RIGOBON and STOKER, 2009). Last, the use of a dummy is not generally advisable since no information is gained (RIGOBON and STOKER, 2007). The estimation of an uncensored port potential requires a censored port activity as the dependent variable. However, a censored dependent variable alters the effective sample (RIGOBON and STOKER, 2007) and introduces distortion into statistical results (WOOLDRIDGE, 2013) when used in a linear model. Removing censored observations makes the sample not represent a whole population (GREEN, 2011) and thus provides biased estimates. A wide range of research on this issue (RIGOBON and STOKER, 2007) recommends the censored regression model, i.e. the Tobit model (GREEN, 2011). Tobit models can address both observed but censored port activities and latent port potentials. Suppose one variable (xp) represents port activities generated by the unobserved port potentials (xp*) that are in turn decided by relevant determinants (xL) (WOOLDRIDGE, 2013). Assuming the zero threshold point, the Tobit model is: 𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝 = 𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝∗ if 𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝∗ > 0 𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝 = 0 if 𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝∗ ≤ 0 (4) and 𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝∗ = 𝛼0 + 𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡 (5) where xL is a vector of the determinants of port potentials, α is a vector of coefficient and ε is the error term following N(0, σ2). In this study, the Tobit model, equations (4) and (5), will be first estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method (Appendix B2) to generate port potentials (xp∗ ). Then, they will be used as a proxy for port activities (xp) in equations (2) and (3). Data The data was obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service operated by the Korean National Statistical Office and the Shipping and Port Integrated Data Centre managed by the Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries of Korea (MOF). Additionally, the port investment data was obtained from a public officer of MOF in person, because it is publicly unavailable. The data comprised of yearly regional data between 2002 and 2013 and has been summarised in Table A1 (Appendix A in the Supplemental data online). Korea has 16 regions including 7 metropolitan areas (ID 1 to 7). It connects to land only to the north (Fig. A1), and most of the regions have coastlines except region ID 1,3,5,6, and 10. The sample period was chosen based on three reasons. First, Chungnam region built container ports in 2007 and Gyeongi region constructed cargo and container ports in 2012. Thus, their impacts on regional economic activities can be more easily identified. Second, the trends of economic indicators in the period may signal the significant role of regional ports on unemployment. For example, the growth rate of GDP per capita (Fig. A2) decreased overall while cargo and container throughputs (Fig. A4) rapidly increased over the sample period. It may have helped the regional unemployment rates (Fig. A3) to remain relatively stable. Last, the recent data set is supplied by the government agencies after their initiatives of providing consolidated and verified data through public platforms as described above. Population and economic activities (Table A1) are concentrated in Seoul and the surrounding regions (ID 1, 4 and 8). The unemployment rate of Korea (Table A2) was 3.05%, on average. The regional average lies between 1.99% and 4.40%. Unemployment rates also vary over time (Fig. A3). Port activities of Korea are overall large but relatively concentrated on 4 major port regions (Table 1), Busan (ID 2), Incheon (4), Ulsan (7) and Jeonnam (13). Surface transportation infrastructure is less varied and more reflects the relative size of regions. Note that Jeju region (16) does not have motorways. Both cargo and container throughputs grow fast in the sample period (Fig. A4). Table 1. Port activities and surface transportation of the regions of Korea.

Chungnam (11) constructed container ports in 2007. 'Major ports' indicates regions with top 4 largest ports in terms of total throughput. Port activity is not observed in some regions as seen in Table 1, Fig. A5 and A6. Specifically, 5 of 16 regions have zero port activity in the entire sample period and two additional regions partly showed zero activity. Also, 70 and 80 individual observations of cargo and container activities are zero (Fig. A7 and A8), respectively. This is typical of left-censored data with non-trivial fraction being censored since zero activity was indeed observed and reported, which supports the use of Tobit models. For the empirical unemployment models in equations (2) and (3), relative unemployment rates will be used as the dependent variable following BLANCHARD and KATZ (1992). A national average of unemployment rates of each year is deducted from regional unemployment rates to calculate the relative rates and control for the national trend in unemployment. Regarding three independent variables in the economic model, first, labour supply is represented by population size since the impacts of other candidates such as participation, migration and commuting are not clearly agreed upon in the literature (ELHORST, 2003). Second, labour demand is approximated by gross regional domestic production (GRDP) since higher economic production essentially requires more workers. Third, wage is represented by household income supposing that most of household income is paid in the form of wage. For the Tobit model in equations (4) and (5), cargo throughput and container throughput are separately tested. The former represents more traditional port activities such as handling of bulk (wet and dry) cargoes, whilst the latter is the output of capital-intensive modern port activities such as handling of twenty or forty feet standardised containers. Thus, their impacts on unemployment can be different. Passenger traffic data was intentionally excluded since a considerable share of passenger traffic tends to be related to transit passengers (BOTTASSO et al., 2013). On the other hand, the length of road and motorway control the effects of other transportation networks, because these transport infrastructures may positively or negatively affect port potentials. For example, a well-developed regional motorway network may either reduce the need for a port or facilitate port construction and development. In addition, four different dummies are used: major ports, major cargo and container ports and one for the regions near Seoul that accounts for their asymmetric presence in the Korean economy. Port infrastructure variables, e.g., the size of berth and yard, are not employed since they may not represent port potentials of non-port regions. RESULTS Tobit model of port potentials – equation (4) and (5) The descriptive statistics of two port activity variables (xp) and two determinants of port potentials (xL) are presented in Table A3. A strong correlation between cargo and container throughputs should not be a concern since they are separately estimated. None of the series have a unit root and thus spurious regression would not happen. Granger causality tests (Table A4) justify the causation implied in the Tobit model since road length significantly leads to cargo throughput and just marginally insignificantly causes the changes in container throughput at the 10% significance level. However, motorway does not have any causal relationship. On the other hand, the strong role of cargo throughput in causing container throughput may be the result of traditional port activities leading to modern activities. The estimation results of the Tobit models with cargo throughout (Table 2) confirm the general significance of independent variables. For example, road length positively affects cargo port potentials. However, motorway length negatively or does not affect them. The models with container port activities (Table 3) show similar results with slightly different significance. This result confirms the difference of traditional port activities and infrastructure (cargo ports and road) from capital-intensive ones (container ports and motorway) in determining port potentials. On the other hand, the positive impact of major port dummies may reflect the relative size of the four largest ports. Being a capital or its neighbourhood reduces port potentials. Although this may be country-specific since the Korean capital, Seoul is located inland, near Incheon port. It indicates that proximity to economic activities is important in deciding port potentials. Table 2. Tobit models of port potentials: cargo throughput.

In both results, Model 3 is the best fit with the lowest Schwarz Information Criterion. The estimated port potentials are calculated from this and used as proxies for port activity variables in the next section. Their descriptive statistics are summarised in Table A5. Strong correlation indicates that two types of port potentials are more closely linked than observed between port activities. On the other hand, maximum port potentials are larger than observed port activities. It possibly shows that some regions do not fully realise port potentials. Also, it could indicate that right-censoring, i.e. censoring from above, may have affected the observed port activities possibly due to physical limitation e.g. handling capacity. However, no distinctive threshold where a large proportion of right-censored values are located is found in Fig. A5 and A6. Although an artificial censoring limit can be set at or above the maximum observed value, it may invalidate estimation results by affecting conditional means and residuals. Models of unemployment – equation (2) and (3) The four economic variables (Table A6) are measured against national average (unemployment rate) or aggregates (population, GDP and household income) following BLANCHARD and KATZ (1992) to control nation-wide economic shocks. High correlation exists between population, GDP and household income as expected from economic variables. However, no corrective measures are introduced because all variables are supported by economic theories and correlation itself does not cause a bias in estimation. Table A7 shows that three independent variables Granger-cause unemployment rates at the 10% significance level. They support the specification of the economic model of unemployment in equation (2). Finally, the economic models of unemployment are estimated (Table 4). First, cargo port activities significantly reduce unemployment rates. 1% more cargo throughput (in ton) reduces the unemployment rate by 0.08% points relative to the national level. The impact seems quite substantial considering the already low and stable employment rate of Korea (Fig. A3) and fast-growing port activities (Fig. A4). For example, 25% relative increase of cargo throughput over 10 years contributes to a 2% point total decrease or 0.2% point annual decrease in the relative unemployment rate. Second, capital-intensive container port activities are not able to reduce unemployment rate unlike labour-intensive cargo port activities. Third, the impacts of population and GDP are as expected in economic theories, but only population is statistically significant. Last, the negative relationship of income to unemployment, although not significant with cargo throughput, is consistent with the literature since higher wages may be paid as compensation for higher living costs in more prosperous regions (ELHORST, 2003).

One-way cross-section (region) fixed-effect models are used based on the redundant fixed-effect tests and the Hausman tests. The estimation results of the autoregressive models of unemployment in equation (3) in Table 5 strongly support the findings in Table 4. The port potentials in terms of both cargo and container throughputs even more significantly decrease relative regional unemployment rates. The estimated impacts become slightly smaller with cargo throughput but larger with container throughput. Specifically, 1% higher cargo and container port potentials are associated with 0.05% and 0.08% point lower relative regional unemployment rates, respectively. Table 5.

One-way cross-section (region) fixed-effect models are used based on the redundant fixed-effect tests and the Hausman tests. On the other hand, the benefits of using uncensored port potentials against censored actual handling data (non-Tobit) are clearer when the results are compared between left- and right-panels in Table 4 and 5. The negative relationship between the port activities and regional unemployment rates is observed only with port potentials in both of the economic and the autoregressive models. Also, port potentials contribute to the greater explanatory power of the models in terms of larger log likelihood and lower information criteria values, except in the economic model with container data. Robustness tests The impact of port activities should be still significant even after adding new independent variables. First, the number of university graduates is for the quality of the workforce. Second, the number of patents represents the level of technology. Last, the amount of port investment is for related government expenditure. They are all measured relative to national aggregates and in logarithm. Three variables are tested in both models of unemployment (Table A8 and A9). The results support the findings in this study. CONCLUDING REMARKS This study examined the port’s influence on local employment in all the 16 regions of Korea by using the economic model of unemployment from labour economics and the pure-empirical autoregressive model on panel data between 2002 and 2013. In addition, this study employed Tobit models in order to estimate unobservable port potentials using relevant determinants, which also overcome the issue of censored port activity data. The result indicates that port activities, represented by port potentials from the Tobit models, statistically significantly reduce the regional unemployment rates of Korea where unemployment rates were already low and stable. It would be plausible that the results are treated as an estimation of the port’s total impact on local employment (as a sum of the direct, indirect and induced employment). In the economic model, which controls for labour supply, demand and wage, the impact of cargo port activities is estimated to be a 0.08% point reduction in unemployment rate relative to the national level per 1% more cargo throughput. For example, if cargo throughput increases by 25% over 10 years, it will contribute a total 2% point or annually 0.2% point lower relative unemployment rate. In the autoregressive models, it is a 0.05% point lower unemployment rate per 1% increase in cargo throughput. On the other hand, the effects of capital-intensive container port activities are not significant in the economic models. However, the autoregressive models, which control for entire non-port activities, show their impact reaches a 0.08% point lower relative unemployment rate per 1% more container throughput. This result is consistent with FAGEDA and GONZALEZ-AREGALL (2014)’s finding that employment in the manufacturing sector is positively affected by the availability of transport infrastructure such as ports. It should be noted that some prior studies found higher unemployment near the port in US (GROBAR, 2008). These conflicting results might be attributed to a fact that the impacts of ports varies according to geographic scale, context, space and time (HALL, 2004). The findings of the significance of the port activities in unemployment are robust in more general specifications when tested with other economic variables that represent the quality of the labour force, the amount of port investment, and the level of technology. The former two variables are not significant in the extended models, but the level of technology significantly increases unemployment. Although some studies empirically found port investment to have a positive impact on economic growth (SONG and VAN GEENHUIZEN, 2014), counter-intuitively, our result shows that there is no positive impact of port investment on unemployment level. A viable explanation would be that the port investment stimulates employment in terms of a port construction or facility expansion in the short term. In turn, it affects the port-cities’ employment and production costs in the long term. It seems that the influence of the port investment on unemployment level might be mediated by other factors (e.g. port-related logistics activities or actual employment for port-related jobs). Alternatively, it may show that port potentials are technically inclusive of port investment. In the Tobit model, it is discovered that the road length has a positive impact on port potentials, whereas motorway length negatively or does not affect cargo port potentials. In general, well-developed land transport infrastructure helps the occurrence of regional economic growth via enhanced accessibility for multi-modal transport chains. However, our result indicates that this land transport infrastructure does not necessarily stimulate port potential. The possible explanation would be that motorway networks might decrease the need for cargo ports, because the well-structured motor networks may encourage shippers or logistics service providers to use other transport modes (e.g. inland transport). Regardless of the findings from the main analysis, it is worth noting here that the transport of cargoes in Korea significantly relies on trucking, rather than the short-sea shipping or rail. Accordingly, traffic congestion has been prevalent. The Busan port (and city) especially suffers severe and chronic traffic congestion (FREMONT and DUCRUET, 2005) even after the opening of Busan New port. Therefore, Busan port authority has tried to alleviate this issue by constructing wider roads to and from the port. To solve this issue in a sustainable way in the long term, the central government keeps encouraging the use of short-sea shipping and rail for domestic transportation of the cargoes. Finally, the finding indicates that in general, ports located in Busan, Incheon, Jeonnam, Ulsan, and near-Seoul regions have a competitive advantage in terms of cargo and container throughput over other ports. Such regions are regarded as relatively developed urban areas in terms of the economies in Korea. The results of this study deserve attention from port policy decision makers in order to take advantage of the existence of the port for higher level of employment, since the finding suggests that the role of ports on local employment appears to be positive. Accordingly, their appropriate decision regarding port development may lead to low unemployment rates, which are indeed beneficial to port-cities. Despite its implications, this study has some limitations. Firstly, a lack of the same data set does not allow us to conduct useful comparisons between countries (e.g. Japan or China). Accordingly, this needs further investigation in future research. Secondly, ports can generate both positive and negative impacts on corresponding regions, so estimating ex post equilibrium between them would be interesting. Thirdly, in terms of methodology, the dynamic relationship between regions such as spill-over effects is not fully examined although autoregressive models are used. This may require the use of multivariate autoregressive models in future data analysis. Finally, future studies could employ the Free Economic Zone (FEZ) as well as various types of zones as a possible control variable, because such various zones may help explain the port potentials. Note also that there are many other types of zones such as Free Economic Zone (FEZ), Free Trade Zone (FTZ), Foreign Exclusive Industrial Complex (FEIC), Customers/Tariff Free Zone (CFZ/TFZ), and Foreign Investment Zone (FIZ) in Korea (for details, see DUCRUET, 2007; INVESTKOREA, 2016).

Blanchard and Katz model BLANCHARD and KATZ (1992) present a system of four equations to explain unemployment disparities across regions using labour economics theories. First, short-run labour demand in a region i at time t is: 𝑤𝑖𝑡 = −𝑎(𝑛𝑖𝑡 − 𝑢𝑖𝑡) + 𝑧𝑖𝑡 (B6) Wage (w) and the labour force (n), the summation of the employed and the unemployed, are measured in a logarithm relative to national counterpart. Unemployment rate (u) is measured as regional less national unemployment rate where both are measured as a ratio of unemployment (U) over employment (E). Then, the term (n-u) is approximately equal to a log employment 1 . This equation denotes a negative relationship between wage (w) and employment (n-u) e.g. a higher wage is associated with lower labour demand. z is the intercept which evolves separately in equation (B(B9). a is a positive coefficient. Second, a wage-setting equation is based on the negative relationship between wage and unemployment implying that higher unemployment is associated with lower wage. 𝑤𝑖𝑡 = −𝑏𝑢𝑖𝑡 + 𝑥𝑖𝑤 (B7) where xw denotes exogenous wage-setting factors and b is a positive coefficient. Third, the change in labour supply (n) depends positively on wage but negatively on unemployment. 𝑛𝑖,𝑡+1 − 𝑛𝑖𝑡 = 𝑐𝑤𝑖𝑡 − 𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑡 + 𝑥𝑖𝑠 + 𝑒𝑖,𝑡+1𝑠 (B8) where xs represents all other region-specific factors, c and g are positive coefficients and es is the error term. Last, the long-run movement in z is: 𝑧𝑖,𝑡+1 − 𝑧𝑖𝑡 = −𝑑𝑤𝑖𝑡 − 𝑘𝑢𝑖𝑡 + 𝑥𝑖𝑑 + 𝑒𝑖,𝑡+1𝑑 (B9) where xd is a region-specific exogenous factor, d and k are positive coefficients and ed is the error term. For instance, higher wage or unemployment reduces z. B2. The maximum likelihood estimation of Tobit model The probability distributions of xp in Equation (4) and (5) are: 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝 = 0|𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋 ) = 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝∗ ≤ 0|𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋 ) = 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏 (𝑧′ =𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝∗ − 𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎≤𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎) (B10) 1 𝑛 = 𝑙𝑛 𝐿 , 𝑢 =𝑈𝐸≅ 𝑙𝑛 (1 +𝑈𝐸) = 𝑙𝑛 (𝐿𝐸) = 𝑙𝑛𝐿 − 𝑙𝑛𝐸 and thus (𝑛 − 𝑢) ≅ 𝑙𝑛𝐸 = Φ (−𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎) = 1 − Φ (𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎) and 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝 > 0|𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋 ) = 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏(𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝∗ > 0|𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋 ) = 1 − Φ (−𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎) = Φ (𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎) (B11) where z ´ is a standard normal variable and Ф is its cumulative distribution function. The individual likelihood function is a combination of (B10) and (B11). Using a dummy (Dit) that has a value of 1 if xp>0 and otherwise zero (WOOLDRIDGE, 2013): 𝐿𝑖 = [1𝜎𝜙 (𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝 − 𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎)]𝐷𝑖𝑡[1 − Φ (𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎)]1−𝐷𝑖𝑡 (B12) Then, the log likelihood function for the entire sample is: 𝑙𝑛𝐿 = ∑ ∑ 𝐷𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑛 [1𝜎𝜙 (𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑝 − 𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎)]𝑁𝑖=1𝑇𝑡=1+ (1 − 𝐷𝑖𝑡)𝑙𝑛 [1 − Φ (𝐱𝐢𝐭𝐋′𝜶𝜎)] (B13) where N is the sample size and T is the number of observations. Then, the maximum likelihood estimation method can be used.
