ABSTRACT: 
The paper jointly evaluates the determinants of the choice of maize growing season (winter vs. summer maize) and economic efficiency of individual producers in Bangladesh using a sample selection framework applied to stochastic frontier models. Model diagnostics reveal that sample selection bias is significant, thereby justifying the use of this approach. Probit results reveal that the probability to choose winter maize are influenced positively by gross return, subsistence pressure and soil suitability, whereas extension contact influences choice negatively. Stochastic cost frontier results reveal that a rise in input prices and output level increases production cost as expected. Among the variables representing the production environment, soil suitability and stability of mean temperature reduce cost, whereas precipitation increases cost. The mean level of economic efficiency is estimated at 0.91, implying that scope still exists to reduce cost further by jointly eliminating technical and allocative inefficiency. Policy implications include measures to improve soil suitability, development of temperature-resistant varieties and price policies to check input price rise while boosting maize price, which will synergistically increase adoption rate as well as profitability of winter maize cultivation in Bangladesh.

IntroductionBangladesh economy is dominated by agriculture contributing 14.9% to the gross domesticproduct (GDP). Of this, the crop sub-sector alone contributes 11.3% to the GDP (BBS2010). Agriculture sector generates about 35.0% of the total foreign exchange earnings(Husain et al. 2001, Islam et al. 2004) and is the main source of employment, absorbing48.1% of the labour force (BBS 2010). Land is the most important and scarce means ofproduction, resulting in intensive cropping on all available cultivable land. The currentlevel of cropping intensity is estimated at 179.0% (BBS 2010). It has been increasinglyrealized that economic development in Bangladesh cannot be achieved without making areal breakthrough in the agricultural sector (Baksh 2003).∗Corresponding author.

Also, the yield potential of the composite varieties of maize released fromthe Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute are 5.5–7.0 t/ha and the hybrid varieties are7.4–12.0 t/ha, which are well above the world average of 5.2 t/ha (FAO 2009). Furthermore,maize production and yield has experienced an explosive growth in Bangladesh in recentyears. For example, the cropped area of maize increased from only 2654 ha in 1971–1972to 128,285 ha in 2008–2009, production from 2249 t to 730,000 t and yield from 0.9 t/hato 5.7 t/ha during the same period. Maize has now positioned itself as the first among thecereals in terms of yield rate (5.7 t/ha) as compared with rice (2.8 t/ha) and wheat (2.2 t/ha)(BBS 2010).Maize possesses a wide genetic variability, enabling it to grow successfully in anyenvironment, and in Bangladesh, it is grown both in winter and in summer time, althoughthe former is the dominant pattern. However, it is not clear as to why farmers choose togrow either summer maize or winter maize but not both even though maize provides higherreturns as compared with both rice (Baksh 2003) and wheat (Hasan 2005). We postulatethat a host of socio-economic factors as well as the production environment within whichthe farmers operate may be responsible for making the choice of growing season andresulting outcome. It is known that the production environment significantly influencesproductivity and efficiency (Sherlund et al. 2002, Rahman and Hasan 2008), but whether italso influences the choice of growing season of a crop is not very clear.Given this backdrop, the present study is aimed at jointly evaluating the decision tochoose maize growing season (i.e. winter vs. summer maize) and its economic efficiencyat the individual producer level. We undertake such a task by using a model recentlydeveloped by Greene (2006, 2008) which provides a general framework to incorporate asample selection procedure in stochastic frontier models. The utility of this framework isits ability to remove the bias of sample selection inherent in these types of studies. Thebias arises because rational farmers choose between summer and winter maize dependingon socio-economic as well as the environmental factors within which they have to operate.Therefore, in this model of rational season selection decision, using observations from asingle season (be it summer or winter maize) alone is likely to produce biased estimates ofthe production functionwhichwill be carried onto biased estimates of production efficiency.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology and the data.Section 3 presents the results. The final section concludes and draws policy implications.2. Methodology2.1. Theoretical frameworkGreene (2006) criticized the most common approach to remove sample selection bias,known as Heckman’s approach (1976), because it is inappropriate in models that are notlinear, such as probit, Tobit and so forth. This is because: (i) the impact on the conditionalmean of the model of interest, if it is non-linear, will not necessarily take the form of aninverse Mills ratio, which is used to correct for the sample selection bias in Heckman’sapproach; (ii) the bivariate normality assumption needed to justify the inclusion of theinverse Mills ratio in the second model does not generally appear anywhere in the model;and finally (iii) the dependent variable, conditioned on the sample selection, is unlikely tohave the distribution described by the model in the absence of selection (Greene 2006).Hence, Greene (2006, 2008) proposed an internally consistent method of incorporatingDownloaded by [Sanzidur Rahman] at 08:03 05 January 2012 140 S. Rahman et al.‘sample selection’ in a stochastic frontier framework, which was adopted in our study andis elaborated next.Farmers are assumed to choose between summer and winter maize to maximize profitssubject to a set of socio-economic and environmental factors. The decision of the ith farmerto choose winter maize is described by an unobservable selection criterion function, Ii∗,which is postulated to be a function of gross return, factors representing farmers’ socio-economic circumstances, and a bio-physical factor within which farmers operate. Theselection criterion function is not observed. Rather a dummy variable, I , is observed. Thevariable takes a value of 1 for winter maize farms and 0 otherwise. The model is specifiedas:I ∗i = γ ′zi + wi , Ii = 1 (I ∗i > 0), (1)where z is a vector of exogenous variables explaining the decision to growwinter or summermaize, γ is a vector of parameters and w is the error term distributed as N(0,σ 2).The production performance of the winter maize farmers is modelled by postulating anextended Cobb–Douglas stochastic cost frontier function.1 The advantages of choosing acost frontier function are: (a) it is self-dual to an underlying production frontier, (2) sincea cost frontier is specified as a function of input prices which are exogenous in nature andtherefore free from any potential endogeneity problem arising from specifying a productionfrontier; (3) it will allow us to determine the level of economic efficiency, also known as costefficiency, which results from both technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. Technicalefficiency refers to a producer’s ability to obtain the highest possible output from a givenquantity of inputs (Rahman 2003). Allocative efficiency refers to a producer’s ability tomaximize profit given technical efficiency. A producer may be technically efficient butallocatively inefficient (Hazarika and Alwang 2003). Therefore, economic/cost efficiencyrefers to a producer’s ability to produce the maximum possible output from a given quantityof inputs at the lowest possible cost and has direct implication for competitiveness of theBangladeshi farmers in the international market.The model is written as follows2:Ci = CD(α′qi + β ′wi + ω′ei + vi + ui) iff I = 1, (2)where w represent input prices (normalized with one of the input prices to impose homo-geneity condition); e represent environmental factors; q represents output level;C representscost of production; α, β and ω are the parameters; v is the two sided random error, indepen-dent of the u, representing random shocks, such as exogenous factors, measurement errors,omitted explanatory variables, and statistical noise; and u is a non-negative random variableassociated with inefficiency in production, assumed to be independently distributed as azero-truncated normal distribution, u = |U | with U ∼ N [0, σ 2u ].The ‘sample selection bias’ arises as a result of the correlation of the unobservablesin the stochastic cost frontier function with those in the season selection equation (Greene2008). In this sample selection framework proposed by Greene (2006, 2008), it is assumedthat the unobservables in the season selection equation are correlated with the ‘noise’in the stochastic cost frontier model. In other words, w in (1) is correlated with v in (2), andtherefore, (v, w) are distributed as bivariate normal distribution with [(0, 0), (σ 2v, ρσv, 1)].The vectors (C, q, w, e) are observed when I = 1.Downloaded by [Sanzidur Rahman] at 08:03 05 January 2012 Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy 141Development of the estimator for this model is detailed in Greene (2006, 2008). Weonly report the final log likelihood function to be estimated (Greene 2006):log Ls =∑ilog1R∑Rr=1{Ii[2σuφ(αq + β ′w +  ′e + σv vir − C)σu)× (γ ′z + ρ vir√1 − ρ2)]+ (1 − Ii)[(−γ ′z − ρ vir√1 − ρ2)]}. (3)Since the integral of this function does not exist in a closed form, Greene (2006, 2008)proposes computation by simulation. When ρ = 0 (i.e., the parameter which measures thecorrelation between w in (1) and v in (2)), the model reduces to that of the conventionalstochastic frontier model and thus provides us with a method of testing existence of sampleselection bias or selectivity (Greene 2008). The model is estimated using NLOGIT Version4 (ESI 2007).2.2. Study areas and the sample farmersMaize is cultivated almost all over the country, though the intensity of planted area andland suitability are not equal in all regions. Therefore, we computed a maize area index foreach greater district.3 The maize area index for the jth district is expressed as:MAIj = (Areaj /GCAj ) ∗ 100, (4)where MAI is the maize area index, Area is the maize area and GCA is the gross croppedarea. In other words, the index reflects the share of maize cropped area in GCA expressedin percentage. Based on this index, maize growing regions were classified into three levelsof intensity: high-intensity (MAI > 1.0), medium-intensity (0.50 < MAI < 1.0) and low-intensity areas (MAI < 0.5).A multistage sampling procedure was adopted to select the sample farmers. First, forwinter maize, three areas were selected according to the rank ofMAI as well as percentageof total winter maize area. The selected regions were Kushtia, Bogra and Dinajpur, whichcovered 59% of total winter maize area of the country. Similar exercise was repeated forsummer maize. The selected regions were Dhaka, Bogra and Dinajpur, which covered 64%of total summermaize area of the country (Table 1). In the second stage, one new district waschosen from each aforesaid selected greater district according to higher percentage of maizearea and ease of communication. Then, one upazila (sub-district) from each new district andone union from each upazilawere selected purposively. Finally, six villages (one from eachunion) were selected randomly for collection of primary data. In the third stage, a numberof steps were followed to select the households to ensure a high level of representation. Atfirst, a list of all maize growing farmers was collected from the Department of AgriculturalExtension (DAE). Then, these farm holdings were stratified into three standard farm-sizecategories commonly adopted in Bangladesh (e.g., Rahman and Hasan 2008). Then, atotal of 300 winter maize and 150 summer maize producing households were selectedfollowing a standard stratified random sampling procedure (Table 1). Two sets of structuredquestionnaires were administered: one for collecting preliminary information of the wholepopulation (i.e., all the maize growers of the village), and another for in-depth informationfrom the sampled farmers. These questionnaires were pre-tested prior to finalization. DataDownloaded by [Sanzidur Rahman] at 08:03 05 January 2012 142 S. Rahman et al.Table1.Selectionofthestudyareaandsamplesize.

First visit was done just after sowing of seeds, second visit followingcompletion of all intercultural operations and the last one after harvesting and threshingof the crop. The formal survey for data collection started from the maize growing seasons(winter and summer) during 2006–2007. For winter season maize, data were collected fromNovember 2006 to April 2007, while for summer season maize data were collected fromFebruary to July 2007.Production-related data on all inputs, e.g., seed, manures, fertilizers, pesticides, irriga-tion, mechanical power, animal power, human labour, etc.; all management operations, suchas ploughing, seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, weeding, harvesting, threshing, winnowing,and bagging; time andmethods of maize cultivation; and socio-economics data, such as age,education, farming experience, farm size and household size of the farmers, were recorded.Market prices of maize and its by-product as well as input prices were also recorded.2.3. The variablesTwo sets of variables are needed for this study: One for the probit season selection model;the other for the stochastic production frontier model, discussed below. The dependentvariable in the probit equation is the farmers’ season selection criterion. This is a binaryvariable that takes the value of 1 if a plot is planted with winter maize and 0 otherwise. Theexplanatory variables include gross return from maize (Tk/ha), farm operation size (ha),irrigation intensity (Tk/ha), farmer’s education (completed years of schooling), farmer’sage (years), farming experience (years), subsistence pressure (persons per household) andextension contact (1, if had extension or training, 0 otherwise). Also an environmentalvariable, the soil suitability index (number), is included.Apart from the maize output level, the six normalized input prices (actually seven,since seed price is used to normalize these six input prices) used in the model includeland rent (Tk/ha), labour wage (Tk/person-day), mechanical power price (Tk/ha), chemicalfertilizer price (Tk/kg), irrigation price (Tk/ha) and organic manure price (Tk/kg), and allare expected to have a positive relationship with the cost of maize production (Tk). Thefour environmental variables included in the model are land suitability index (number), soilsuitability index (number), total rainfall during the growing season4 (mm) and temperaturestability (i.e. mean temperature range calculated as maximum temperature – minimumtemperature) during the season5 (in ◦C). We expect a negative relationship of cost with landand soil quality variables but the influence of other two variables (rainfall and temperature)is unknown. Since the variables in the probit season selection equation and the stochasticcost frontier differ substantially, the structural model satisfies the identification criterion(Maddala 1983).3. Results3.1. Socio-economics, production environment and resource use patternsTable 2 presents the comparison of socio-economic circumstances, production environmentand resource use patterns among winter and summer maize farmers. Some interestingobservations can be made from the results of this exercise. We see that although there areno significant differences in farmers’ socio-economic circumstances (i.e., age, education,and farming experiences except subsistence pressure), the winter maize growers tend to belarge farmers, as evident from their overall farm operation size. The summer maize growersreceived significantly higher level of extension and/or training support, which is surprising.Downloaded by [Sanzidur Rahman] at 08:03 05 January 2012 144 S.

Rainfall issignificantly higher during the summer period, as expected. Variability in temperature is,however, significantly higher in the winter season. Winter maize is grown on significantlybetter land types and soils than summer maize. In terms of resource use and outputs, wintermaize generates significantly higher yield and returns. The use of inorganic fertilizers,organic manure, irrigation and mechanical power is also significantly higher in wintermaize production, although there is no difference in the cultivated area and labour use ratesbetween the seasons, which is again surprising. One reason forwarded by the farmers forsignificantly lower use of inorganic fertilizers and for not using organic manure duringsummer maize is that they planted this crop immediately after harvesting potatoes, whichinitially had received high doses of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Therefore, the inherentfertility of the soils is assumed to be high and carried through to summer maize crop, whichapparently does not seem to be a valid assumption, as the yields are significantly lower forsummer maize.3.2. Determinants of the choice of maize growing seasonThe Chi-squared test statistic in the probit season selection equation is significant at the1% level, confirming joint significance of the parameters (Table 3). The McFadden R2 isestimated at 0.54. About 88% of the observations were accurately predicted, which is verysatisfactory.Gross return frommaize production and subsistence pressures are the importantdeterminants in choosing winter maize. However, extension contact depresses the choice ofTable 3.

The soil suitability significantly influencesthe choice of winter maize cultivation, thereby establishing our a priori expectation thatenvironmental factors within which the farmers operate do play an important role in theirdecision-making processes (Table 3).3.3. Factors influencing cost of winter maize productionPrior to discussing the results of the stochastic cost frontier, we report two sets of hypothesistests conducted. The first test was conducted to determine the appropriate functional form,i.e., the choice between a Cobb–Douglas functional form (using only standard input pricesand output level) and an extended Cobb-Douglas functional form (adding environmentalvariables as well) (H0: ωk = 0 for all k). A generalized likelihood ratio (LR) test confirmedthat the choice of extended cost function is a better representation of the production structure(χ2(4,0.95) = 8.57, p < 0.05).Second, we conduct the model specification test, i.e., testing whether sample selectionbias is present or not. This was done by fitting the sample selectionmodel while constrainingρ to equal zero (Greene 2008). The log likelihood functions were then compared using theChi-squared statistic. The null hypothesis of ‘no sample selection bias’ has been stronglyrejected at the 1% level, implying that the use of sample selection framework is valid andjustified (χ2(1,0.99) = 26.36, p < 0.01). The coefficient on the ρ variable reported at thebottom of Table 4 also confirms that sample selection bias is present (p < 0.01).Table 4.

Nine coefficients out of a total of 11 are significantly different from zero atthe 10% level at least, implying a good fit. Both the estimates of σ u and σ v are significantlydifferent from zero at the 1% level. The coefficient on the ρ variable is significantly differentfrom zero at the 1% level, which confirms that serious sample selection bias exists, therebyjustifying the use of the sample selection framework. In other words, this finding confirmsthat estimation using observations from only single season ofmaize producers (either winteror summer maize producer) will provide biased estimates of cost, which will then be carriedon to the biased estimates of economic efficiency scores as well.The cost of maize production increases with an increase in output level, as ex-pected. Also, cost is influenced by a rise in input prices, consistent with theory. Sincethe Cobb–Douglas model is used, the coefficients can be read directly as cost elasticities.Fertilizer price has the highest elasticity value of 0.29, implying that a 1% increase in fer-tilizer price will increase production cost by 0.29%. Similarly, labour wage and mechanicalpower prices exert similar upward pressure on production cost of maize. It is surprising tosee that land rent has no significant influence.As expected, the production environment within which the farmers operate significantlyinfluences the cost of maize production, although incorporation of these variables is largelyignored in the literature analyzing productivity of agricultural crops with few exceptions(e.g., Sherlund et al. 2002, Barrios et al. 2008, and Rahman and Hasan 2008). Cost ofproduction is significantly lower when the soils are of good quality (i.e., silt or silt loam).The land type variable also has the correct sign, but the coefficient is not significantlydifferent from zero. Stability in mean temperature significantly reduces the cost of maizeproduction. However, high rainfall during the winter months increases the cost.3.4. Economic efficiency of winter maize farmersThe summary statistics of economic efficiency scores for winter maize farmers, correctedfor sample selection bias, are presented in Table 5. The mean economic efficiency isestimated at 91%, implying that 10% [(100–91)/91] of the profitability is lost due to acombination of technical and allocative inefficiency. This implies that the average farmproducing winter maize could reduce cost by 10% by improving economic efficiency. Ourestimate is at the higher end of the range seen in the literature (e.g., Coelli et al. 2002,Hazarika and Alwang 2003, Bravo-Ureta et al. 2007, Rahman and Hasan 2008), imply-ing that maize performs relatively better than rice and wheat, particularly in Bangladesh(e.g., Coelli et al. 2002, Rahman 2003, Rahman and Hasan 2008). Farmers exhibit a wideTable 5.

Rahman et al.range of economic inefficiency, ranging from 1% to 26% in winter maize farming. Obser-vation of a wide variation in production efficiency is not surprising and is similar to theresults of Ali and Flinn (1989), Wang et al. (1996), Rahman (2003) and Bravo et al. (2007)for Bangladesh, Pakistan Punjab, China, and a total of 167 case studies from developingcountries, respectively.4. Conclusions and policy implicationsThe present study jointly evaluates factors affecting Bangladeshi farmers’ decision tochoose the maize growing season and its economic efficiency at the individual producerlevel. Themodel diagnostics reveal that serious sample selection bias exists, thereby justify-ing the use of the sample selection framework in stochastic frontier models. The implicationis that estimation from only single season of maize producers (i.e., either winter or summermaize producers) will provide biased results of the determinants of seasonal choice andprofitability, as well as farm-specific economic efficiency scores.The results confirm that both socio-economic and environmental factors significantlydetermine the probability of choosing winter maize. A rise in input prices significantlyincreases the production cost of maize, whereas good-quality soils and stability in meantemperature reduce the cost. Economic inefficiency still exists in winter maize production,which arises due to a combination of both technical and allocative inefficiency. The meanlevel of economic efficiency of these self-selected winter maize farmers is estimated at91%, implying that although the maize farmers in Bangladesh are doing very well, there isscope to reduce inefficiency.The policy implications are clear. Investment in improving soil suitability and thedevelopment of temperature-resistant varieties will significantly induce farmers to adoptwinter maize technology as well as reduce the cost of production. Similarly, price policiesto curb rising input prices on one hand and keeping maize prices high on the other will boostfarm returns and reduce production cost. In fact, high price of good-quality seed, fertilizersand low price of maize were ranked as the first, fourth and sixth major constraints by thesemaize growers. One important option to reduce high price of good-quality maize seedwill be to increase production and distribution of maize seeds by Bangladesh AgriculturalDevelopment Corporation (BADC), which is in charge of distributing high-quality seeds ofcereals and vegetables to farmers. BADC estimates that the sowing area of maize is 180,000ha in 2011, which requires 6250 t of maize seeds. However, the existing production of maizeseed at BADC is 500 t (i.e., only 8% of the requirement) in 2011, which they project toraise to 2200 t by 2015, which is still only 35% of the existing requirement (BADC, n.d.).Therefore, the other option is to encourage private sectors to enter the maize seed marketthrough incentives as open competition will drive price downwards, but care must be givento avoid collusion by a handful of big seed companies. Similarly, private sector should beencouraged to fill the gap in the fertilizer market as well, which has been liberated fromgovernment control since 1992. In order to improvemarket price of maize crop, governmentmay intervene in the market by restricting imports of maize and maize products (e.g., maizestarch). At the same time, government can promote vertical integration of value-addedproducts derived from maize (e.g., maize starch), which will drive demand for maizeupwards, leading to a rise in its price. Also, awareness campaigns to promote and/orinclude consumption of maize and maize products in Bangladeshi diets will boost demandfor maize, leading to a rise in its price. Although realization of these policy measures isformidable, a boost in maize production could significantly curb dependence on rice as themain staple in Bangladeshi diet, which is a goal worth pursuing.Downloaded by [Sanzidur Rahman] at 08:03 05 January 2012 Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy 149Notes1. We did not use the translog model in order to avoid collinearity because we are using a largenumber of input prices. Moreover, Kopp and Smith (1980) suggest that the choice of functionalform has a limited effect on efficiency. Consequently, the Cobb–Douglas specification is widelyused in production or cost frontier studies (e.g., Hazarika and Alwang 2003, Rahman and Hasan2008, Asadullah and Rahman 2009).2. Only winter maize cost frontier function is shown here. The counterpart is the summer maize costfrontier. The model selects the winter maize producers from the total sample (composed of bothwinter and summer maize producers) based on the information provided in the probit selectionequation.3. Although there are 64 districts in Bangladesh, most secondary data are still reported at the levelof these 21 former greater districts.4. Data on total rainfall is also collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD).Time-series data on monthly rainfall collected at selected measurement stations that correspondclosely to each greater district (sometimes two stations fall within one district) is availablefrom the BMD. We have used data for corresponding months of the maize growing season(November–April for winter maize and February–July for summer maize) of the sampled regions.5. BMD also collects mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature disaggregated at regionallevel.We have used data for correspondingmonths of themaize growing season (November–Aprilfor winter maize and February–July for summer maize).ReferencesAli, M. and Flinn, J.C., 1989.
