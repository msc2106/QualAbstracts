ABSTRACT: 
Popular cultures in Western societies have long espoused the notion that phases of the moon influence human behavior. In particular, there is a common belief the full moon increases incidents of aberrant, deviant, and criminal behavior. Using police, astronomical, and weather data from a major southwestern American city, this study assessed whether lunar cycles related with rates of reported crime. The findings fail to support popular lore, which has suggested that lunar phase influenced the volume of crime reported to the police. Future research directions examining qualitative rather than quantitative aspects of this problem may yield further inform the understanding of whether lunar cycles appreciably influence demands for policing services.

All rights reserved.It is the very error of the moon;She comes more near the earth than she was wont,And makes men mad.-Othello, Act V, Scene IIIntroductionWestern lore has long suggested a relationship between thephases of the moon and various forms of aberrant, antisocial, deviant,and criminal human conduct. Popular thinking, visual arts, drama, andliterature have expressed this notion well beyond the legend ofvampire, werewolves, witches, and warlocks. The root of the word“lunatic” is “luna,” Latin for “moon” (Merriam-Webster OnlineDictionary, 2008). Even in contemporary times with considerableadvances in scientiﬁc knowledge, there was a continued belief thatlunar phases effect human behavior (Lieber, 1996; Rotton & Kelly,1985; Rotton, Kelly, & Elortegui, 1986) including limited evidence of ahigh rate of belief among mental health care providers (Vance, 1995).An on-going debate concerned whether lunar effects could beempirically veriﬁed; that is, whether “a disproportionate number ofdeviant or abnormal episodes occur when the moon is full” (Culver,Rotton, & Kelly, 1988, p. 684).Policing, crime, and criminal justice have not been immune fromspeculation concerning the lunar-crime relationship. In workingwith police ofﬁcers on a wide range of research projects, the authorsfrequently heard individuals express the belief that the quality and/orquantity of activity were linkedwith full moons (see also Lieber, 1996,p. 21). Such beliefs have been systematically veriﬁed through surveysof police ofﬁcers (Rotton et al., 1986; Vance, 1995). The study reportedherein examined the lunar-crime relationship using ﬁve years ofpolicing, astronomical, and weather data from a major southwesternAmerican city. The results were inconclusive in supporting whatpopular lore would suggest being true. With few exceptions themoon's phase was not related with the level of crime and disorderreported to the police, controlling for relevant weather conditions.The limited signiﬁcant ﬁndings would tend to contradict the lunarlore, suggesting that when lunar phasemattered it constrained, ratherthan increasing, targeted forms of aberrant behavior.How might lunar phase affect behavior?The cultural lore concerning lunar effects is vague in describing thespeciﬁc ways and reasons for the moon's effect. Most lunar effectstudies had not gone into great depth in explaining how and why themoon inﬂuenced human conduct. It simply noted that lunar effectsmight have been expected. Scientiﬁc study of lunar effects might bestbe grouped into two broad categories: (1) the notion that lunar cycleinﬂuences certain opportunities for criminal acts and (2) the notionthat the moon inﬂuences human behavior in some measurablemanner. Prior research tended to frame inquiry in light of the latterhypothesis—that lunar cycles inﬂuenced rates of aberrant behavior.The former category had received less scholarly inquiry, perhapsbecause it implied the effect of the moon was far less direct. Ratherthan actually causing human behavior, this perspective suggests thatrational choices concerning criminality are inﬂuenced by a number ofJournal of Criminal Justice 38 (2010) 359–367☆ This paper was accepted under the Editorship of Kent Joscelyn.⁎ Corresponding author.

Under this line of thinking, afull moon does not actually cause offenders to commit criminal acts;rather, the illumination provided by a full moon serves to facilitate orhinder certain forms of criminal conduct. Rational offenders mightinclude lunar illumination in making assessments about theirbehaviors. Just as a burglar would look for a property offering easyentry and with limited guardianship, she/he would also be motivatedto avoid committing that crime in well-lit areas, such as those withexterior illumination, street lights, or signiﬁcant ambient moon light.To do so would be to risk detection by alert citizens or the police.The latter category, in contrast, was the subject of much of theexisting social and behavioral scholarship. The physical sciences havelong-established the relationship between the moon and geophysicalconditions on earth, particularly the ebb and ﬂow of tides. Thisrelationship led some medical and social science researchers topostulate the high concentration of water in the human body wouldresult in a similar gravitational pull that could have affected humanbehavior (see Lieber, 1978b, 1996). Although most research followedthis line of thinking, the relationship was usually not made explicitlyclear. Research was focused on testing the existence of a lunar effect,rather than explaining the actual reason for an observed effect. Thevagueness of the mechanisms driving the postulated lunar-behaviorrelationships complicated efforts aimed at empirical veriﬁcation.Studies of lunar effectsSocial science research has studied lunar effects using a wide rangeof methodologies, data sources, populations, and variables. Theresulting body of literature tended to suggest weak to non-existentlunar effects, though a few vocal scholars argued improper method-ologies were to blame for mixed ﬁndings (Cyr & Kaplan, 1987, 1988;Lieber & Sherin, 1972; Templer & Veleber, 1980). As addressed below,the debate over lunar effects was as much a debate over ‘proper’methodology as a debate over actual inﬂuences. Some contendedimproper methods resulted in null ﬁndings; others argued thatstray observed effects tended to disappear upon introducing controlvariables into an analysis (Bickis, Kelly, & Byrnes, 1995; Durm, Terry, &Hammonds, 1986; Kelly & Rotton, 1983; Rotton, Kelly, & Frey, 1983).Studies generally failed to ﬁnd a lunar effect, though researchersfound varying associations between lunar phase and some categoriesof crime (Purpura, 1979), aggression (Lieber, 1978a), violent incidentsin correctional settings (Pettigrew, 1985), volume of demand foremergency room services (Blackmon & Catalina, 1973), suicideattempts (Taylor & Diespecker, 1972), hospital admissions (Templer& Veleber, 1980; Weiskott & Tipton, 1975), and calls to telephonecounseling services (Templer & Veleber, 1980; Weiskott, 1974). Moststudies employed few (if any) controls, used short time frames (i.e.,four months, which only measured effects across four lunar cycles),and achieved relatively weak statistical signiﬁcance, sometimesﬁnding effects on some dependent variables, but not on others. Inaddition to ﬁnding a lunar effect during periods of full moons, studiesfound effects of new moons—periods when the moon was notreﬂecting the sun's light back toward earth, making it difﬁcult toobserve with the naked eye (Templer & Veleber, 1980; Templer,Veleber, & Brooner, 1982).Despite these positive associations, the majority of lunar researchfailed to establish effects. This included failing to ﬁnd effects on:aggressive acts in prisons (Atlas, 1984; Simon, 1998) and psychiatricfacilities (Durm et al., 1986; Quinsey & Varney, 1977), prison escapes(Pettigrew, 1985), use of hospital psychiatric services (Bauer &Hornick, 1968; Shapiro, Streiner, Gray, Williams, & Soble, 1970;Walters, Markley, & Tiffany, 1975), incidents of suicide (Biermannet al., 2005), use of telephone crisis centers (Wilson & Tobacyk,1990), hospital admissions for dog bite injuries (Chapman &Morrell, 2000), aggression among ice hockey players (Russell & deGraaf, 1985; Russell & Dua, 1983), demands for police and ﬁre services(Bickis et al., 1995; Frey, Rotton, & Barry, 1979), automobile accidents(Campbell & Beets, 1978; Laverty & Kelly, 1998), suicide (Lester,Brockopp, & Priebe, 1969), and homicide (Pokorny & Jachimczyk,1974). Studies often achieved contradictory results on crime-relatedoutcomes, particularly calls for policing service and homicides. Attimes, two sets of researchers examined the same data and achievedopposite conclusions (cf. Kelly & Rotton, 1983; Templer et al., 1982)due to inconsistency in conceptualizing and operationalizing keystudy variables, as well as using different statistical controls andprocedures.Lunar effects on crimeDespite the volume of research testing for lunar effects, fewresearchers employed crime-related outcomes (exceptions includedCohn, 1993; Purpura, 1979). Where relationships were found lunarinﬂuences were modest, particularly in contrast to temporal andsituational predictors. There are several reasons to hypothesize thatlunar cycles may inﬂuence crime, either due to direct effects onhuman behavior or as a factor inﬂuencing rational offenders. First andforemost, though not directly tested in this study, research has shownthat belief in lunar effects continued to be strong (Russell & Dua,1983), including among police ofﬁcers (Rotton & Kelly, 1985; Rottonet al., 1986; Vance, 1995) and tended to be associated with beliefs inother paranormal phenomena (Rotton & Kelly, 1985). Ofﬁcers havethe beneﬁt of directly observing the aftermath of criminal incidents;their experiences may provide them with unique insights into lunareffects, or police culture may simply perpetuate false beliefs aboutlunar effects. Second, studies of lunar effects on crime tended to uselimited offenses and short time frames, while failing to introducecontrol variables. This study sought to overcome weaknesses inprior studies by considering a long-time frame, multiple offensetypes, and salient control variables. Third, moving beyond the beliefsof police ofﬁcers, there was evidence that beliefs in lunar effectswere prevalent. Testing the veracity of these beliefs was of obviousimportance.Is crime inﬂuenced by seasons or short-term variations inclimate conditions?One of the ﬁrst observations about the effects of weather on crimewas offered by Belgian statistician Adolphe Quételet (1842/1969),who noted “during summer, the greatest number of crimes againstpersons are committed and the fewest crimes against property; thecontrary takes place during the winter” (p. 90). For over 150 yearsscholars tested and elaborated on this assertion, introducing broadermeteorological data into empirical models. The social contacthypothesis suggests that during times of pleasant weather, aggressiveand hostile acts may be more common because there is an increase innormal human interactions, which increases the opportunity forinterpersonal conﬂict. Within weather and crime research, scholarsattempted to sort out the social versus physiological effects of weatheron human behavior (Cheatwood, 1995).More contemporary analyses of policing data from Americancommunities tended to ﬁnd that many types of personal and propertycrimes were more common during periods of warm versus cool orcold weather (Cheatwood, 1995; Cohn, 1990b, 1996; Cohn & Rotton,2000; Hipp, Bauer, Curran, & Bollen, 2004; Rotton & Cohn, 2003) andthat demand for police services were greater during periods ofwarmer temperature and longer hours of daylight (i.e., spring andsummer) (Cohn, 1996; Heller & Markland, 1970; LeBeau & Corcoran,1990; LeBeau & Langworthy, 1986).1 Research suggested thisrelationship generally held true, though there were upper limits.Rotton and Cohn (2000) found disorderly conduct and assault inMinneapolis had an ‘inverted U-shaped’ relationship; during periodsof extreme heat and cold these behaviors were less frequent. In360 J.A. Schafer et al. / Journal of Criminal Justice 38 (2010) 359–367reviewing early weather and crime research, Cohn (1990a) observedresearch established stronger relationships for personal than propertycrimes, notingassaults, burglary, collective violence, domestic violence, and rapetend to increase with ambient temperature…The relationshipbetween heat and homicide is uncertain. High temperatures donot appear to be correlated with robbery, larceny, and motorvehicle theft. (p. 61)When analyses accounted for temporal variables (i.e., time ofday, weekends, holidays, periods when public schools are not insession), weather effects offered relatively modest explanatory effects(Cheatwood, 1995; Cohn, 1993). The inﬂuence of temporal andweather variables were presumably a result of changes in routineactivities of offenders and victims (e.g., Cohen & Felson, 1979), thoughthese effects might be trumped by situational variables (Rotton &Cohn, 2000).‘Methodological chaos’A signiﬁcant challenge surrounding the study of lunar effects onhuman behavior is the imprecision of this cultural lore. What, exactly,is themoon supposed to inﬂuence andhow is that inﬂuence exercised?Such basic questions hold tremendous implications for conceptual,operational, and analytical decisions. Similar concerns are notedin literature examining weather-crime relationships (Block, 1983,1984).2 How, for example, should lunar phase be deﬁned andmeasured?3 Also important to consider is whether the relationship isbased on the moon's visibility, which would suggest restricting ananalysis to nighttime hours and controlling for salient weatherconditions?4 If there is an effect on crime, is it the quality of crime(i.e., offenders act more ‘crazy’ than normal), quantity (i.e., thevolume of crime), or both? Will crime-related effects translate intopolice records in an observable manner? The contention that existing“methodological chaos hasmade impossible any consistency in resultsin the evaluation of the lunar hypothesis” (Cyr & Kaplan, 1987, p. 391)was well founded. While characterizing previous efforts to studythis alleged phenomenon as chaotic may be overly dramatic, suchdifﬁculties should be expected when scholars sought to study a vague,ill-deﬁned, and indistinct dimension of western cultural lore.Decisions concerning proper data sources, variable structures,operational deﬁnitions, and statistical tests, among other considera-tions, were not straight-forward. Block (1983) noted a similarassessment when testing for seasonal effects on crime. Her mono-graph offered a number of insightful parallels to analyzing lunareffects. For example, Block noted researchers were typically con-strained by the quality and structure of the data at hand; even whenthere was great control over data sources and variable structures,there were few clear rules for conducting analyses. Given the folkloreorigins of the lunar effect, researchers did not have a clear mapinforming choices concerning the selection of dependent andindependent variables, or the analytical methods used to examinedata. This situation certainly contributed to the widely varyingmethodologies and results observed across salient research literature.Research objectiveThe purpose of this study was to test the effects of lunar phase oncriminal and criminal and disorderly behavior through the constructof methodological framework more rigorous than those found inmany prior studies. San Antonio, Texas, is located in the southwesternUnited States and has a population of more than onemillion residents.Using call for service (CFS) to the San Antonio Police Department(SAPD) (e.g., 911) over a ﬁve-year period (2001-2005) as a measureof crime and disorder, a time-series design was used to determine thelinear relationship between lunar cycles and levels of reported crimeand disorder. Calls for service that occurred during nighttime hours(8 p.m. – 3 a.m.) were grouped into seven categories: assaultiveviolence, burglary, theft, drugs/vice, trafﬁc, other disturbances, andaggregated CFS (the sum of the six categories). In so doing, the studyattempted to control for two competing perspectives about theinﬂuence of lunar phase. First, did lunar phase itself appear toinﬂuence activities reported to the police; did lunar phase produce aquantitative shift in human behavior as measured by the volume ofselect categories of calls to the police? Second, could lunar phasecreate conditions that would enhance or diminish the rationality ofselect offenses? The research design accounted for potential impactsof land use issues by analyzing citywide trends, but also consideredtrends in both San Antonio's entertainment area and non-entertain-ment areas.MethodologyThe analysis relied on ﬁve years (2001-2005) of data for policecalls for service and National Weather Service (NWS) records thatdepicted San Antonio's weather patterns during the same period. Asstate above, the purpose of this researchwas to determine if therewasa relationship between lunar cycles and nightly crime levels, aperception that was embedded in the folklore shared by both policepersonnel and citizens. The analysis ﬁrst considered descriptiveanalysis of variables along with bivariate correlation analysis; thiswas followed by multivariate and time series analysis on each of thedependent variables to determine the impact of lunar cycles on levelsof crime and disorder.Dependent variablesCFS data represented instances of crime and disorder that werereceived by the dispatch unit of the SAPD and are more typicallyknown as “911 calls” to most citizens. The data provided by SAPD'scrime analysis unit were limited to calls of direct jurisdiction of lawenforcement (i.e., requests falling under the jurisdiction of otherservice providers were not included). Incidents of concern to lawenforcement typically involved alleged crimes or other incidentsrequiring that an ofﬁcer be dispatched to a scene. During the timeperiod under consideration, SAPD received approximately 900,000CFS per year; this resulted in approximately 225,000 completed policeincident reports per year. Annually, approximately 130,000 CFSconcerned the six disorder categories considered in this analysis.Nightly counts of crime and disorder were computed for seven CFScategories: assaultive violence, burglary, theft, drugs/vice, trafﬁc, otherdisturbances, and aggregated CFS. Nighttime was operationalized asreported incidents between 8p.m. to 3 a.m. Using January 2, 2001 as anexample, total nighttime CFS were calculated for calls receivedbetween 8 p.m. on January 1 and 3 a.m. on January 2, 2001. SanAntonio has a well-known and established entertainment district (theRiverwalk) within its borders. The Riverwalk draws a high volume oftourists and residents to restaurants, bars, hotels, convention facilities,shops, and other entertainment venues. To account for possible landuse effects (see Brantingham & Brantingham, 1995; Robinson &Rengert, 2006) CFS totals were computed for the entire city, the non-entertainment area alone, and the entertainment area alone. Thisstrategy allowed for consideration of any possible interplay with landuse (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics).Independent variablesThe key independent variable, lunar phase, was a continuous levelvariable that measured the where the moon was in its lunar cycle atmidnight during each date in the analysis. This data were publiclyavailable from the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S.361J.A. Schafer et al. / Journal of Criminal Justice 38 (2010) 359–367Naval Observatory (see http://aa.usno.navy.mil). The variable rangedfrom 0 (a newmoon night) to 1.00 (a full moon night); this value wasbased on the presumption of a clear sky and did not take into accountany weather conditions that might have obstructed the actualvisibility of the moon.5 Each night constructed for the dependentvariable was paired with the respective lunar phase at midnight. Inother words, the dependent variable consisted of CFS counts for eachnight (8 pm – 3 am) in the ﬁve years under consideration; thesenights were paired with the lunar phase reported for midnight on thatsame night. This approach represented a substantial advancement inthis area of study. Prior research tended to operationalize lunar phasein dichotomous (full moon versus non-full moon periods) (see Atlas,1984; Cohn, 1993; Purpura, 1979) or basic ordinal terms (full moon,new moon, and “interphase”; new moon, ﬁrst quarter, full moon, lastquarter) (see Kelly & Rotton, 1983; Pokorny & Jachimczyk, 1974;Templer et al., 1982). These approaches restricted the lunar phase tonominal or ordinal variability; this analysis employed a more robustratio variable to represent lunar phase.Control variables were included to account for possible seasonal,temporal and weather effects that might have mediate lunar effects.Winter accounted for seasonal ﬂuctuations inweather that might haveaffected socialization patterns related with rates of crime. Winter wasa dummy variable where “1” indicated dates that fell betweenDecember 1 and March 31. It was expected that crime patterns wouldnaturally decrease during winter months and then increase duringother months (see Cheatwood, 1988). The variable weekend, also abinary variable, was coded as “1” to represent Fridays, Saturdays, andSundays. Social patterns that inﬂuence levels of crime and disorderwere expected to independently affect nightly crime patterns.Additional control variables represented weather patterns andwere derived from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), adivision of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. NCDCrecords are based on data and observations collected by instrumentsand human observers at NWS stations around the country. Data fromthe NWS station located at the San Antonio International Airport wereused to represent weather. These controls were important because iflunar cycles inﬂuenced the opportunity for crime through increasedvisibility, such effects could have been diminished by inclementweather that obscures such visibility.Weather also had the capacity toinﬂuence social patterns that may have independently inﬂuencedcrime and disorder levels.Sunsetwas a continuous variable that identiﬁed the ofﬁcial time ofsunset based on a twenty-four hour (military) clock. Time of sunsetmay have inﬂuenced social patterns that also affected crime levels.Nightly temp reﬂected the temperature recorded by the NCDS indegrees Fahrenheit. The NCDS data included temperature observa-tions taken at three hour increments thorough the day. For thisanalysis mean nightly temperatures were computed using the 9 pm,midnight, and 3 am observation periods. The temperature wasexpected to be positively associated with crime levels. Finally,precipitation was a continuous variable that measured precipitation(in inches) during the twenty-four hours on each day. This measurewas a proxy indicator of the overall extent to which prevailingweather patterns might have made criminal acts less favorable. Levelsof crime and disorder were expected to be negatively associated withprecipitation. See Table 1 for descriptive statistics.Analysis and ﬁndingsTo test for possible lunar effects on crime and disorder levels,analyses of nightly crime trends was done while controlling fortemporal and weather variables that may mediate any apparenteffects. The analysis included univariate descriptive statistics thatdescribes each of the independent variables across the three land usetypes (e.g., citywide, non-entertainment area, and entertainment areaonly). In addition, bivariate and multivariate statistics were used todetermine the relationships between lunar cycles and crime whilecontrolling for other possible explanatory variables. The multivariateanalysis included time series design commonly referred to asautoregressive moving average (ARIMA) technique or ordinary-leastsquares regression. The exact analytical techniques used were basedon a preliminary analysis of time or season-related patterns thatrequired statistical control. A diagnostic tool available in the SPSS wasused to automatically determine if time-or-season-dependent trendsexisted in each trend. When no such patterns were evident, simpleOLS analysis was used. When time-dependent trends were apparent,time-series analysis was used to control for these patterns.The descriptive statistics are included in Table 1. There were 1,826nights included in the study period of January 1, 2001 to December31st 2005. These nightly units comprised each unique observation orunit of analysis. The statistics included in the top half of Table 1provide summary measures of nightly crime totals (counts) foraggregated crime and the six subcategories (assaultive violence,burglary, theft, drugs/vice, trafﬁc, and disturbances) for all three areasof the city. It is important to note that these crime classiﬁcations werebased on how events were classiﬁed in call for service (911) data andnot ofﬁcial police reports. This method of measuring crime anddisorder did not take into account if police failed to ﬁle a police reportor changed the classiﬁcation of an incident to another category thanoriginally classiﬁed in the call data. Thus, the categorizations reﬂectedthose made by call takers after consultation with complainants/victims. An advantage of this approach was removing the possiblybiasing effects of ofﬁcer beliefs; if ofﬁcers believed crime increasedduring full moon phases they may have had a proclivity to categoriesincidents as criminal and/or more serious in nature.Table 1Descriptive statistics for nightly totals (n=1826)Citywide Totals Non-Entertainment Area Entertainment Area OnlyMin.

Schafer et al. / Journal of Criminal Justice 38 (2010) 359–367A comparison of the absolute values of average nightly countsacross geographical areas was not valid because the areas includeddifferent geographical sizes with different size populations at risk. Thedata presented in Table 1 indicated that the average number of callsfor service reporting criminal situations was approximately 360 pernight with a range 806 reports (see citywide totals). The largest singlegroup of reported crimes/disorders was the “disturbances” categoryfor the citywide data, but also for the entertainment and non-entertainment areas. This category was a very broad grouping thatincluded a wide-range of problematic behavior including disorderlypersons, loud parties, suspicious persons, etc. It amounted to a “catchall” classiﬁcation for events that did not fall neatly into othercategories. The next largest categories were burglary and assaultiveviolence for both the citywide and non-entertainment area totals. Theaverage nightly totals for assaultive violence (x ̄=4.55) were higher inthe entertainment area compared to other sectors of the city. This waslikely due to differences in land use patterns and the nature ofsocialization patterns (e.g., high density of bars and other entertain-ment establishments).The second grouping of variables included the principle indepen-dent variables, lunar phase, and ﬁve additional variables thatcontrolled for seasonal (winter), temporal (weekend and time ofsunset), and weather (nightly temperature and precipitation) varia-tions. The average lunar phase across the observation time was ﬁfty-percent. The sunset time was measured on a military time scale thatranges from 0-2400; the average time of sunset was 1843 hours, or6:43 pm. The average temperature during the nightly observationperiods was 65 degrees (Fahrenheit). Finally, there was approximate-ly .10 inches of daily precipitation during the study period, though anappreciable range was noted on that variable.Bivariate analysisBivariate correlations are included in Table 2. At the bivariate level,the data suggested there was no relationship between lunar phaseand crime. This relationship generally held for citywide disorderpatterns, but also for crime trends in non-entertainment andentertainment areas with one exception. The relationship betweendrugs/vice crimes in the entertainment district was signiﬁcant andnegative, although the coefﬁcient was relatively small. This relation-ship suggested that while illumination was not a factor in crime, theinﬂuence was dependent on land use patterns. It was also noteworthythat many of the temporal, seasonal and weather control variableswere signiﬁcant across the data, largely in the expected directions.Winter was a seasonal control variable; it was hypothesized thatdue to changes in season-related socialization patterns, crime wouldlikely be lower during the winter. The signiﬁcant and negativerelationship across crime types and locations indicates that crime/disorder was generally lower during winter months, even in such atemperate climate. Weekend was a temporal control that depicted ifthe observation period occurred on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.Related again to natural variations in socialization patterns linked today-of-the-week, a positive relationship was expected. That is, morecrime was expected on the weekends. The hypothesis was supportedby the signiﬁcant and positive relationships across crime types andgeographical locations, relationships that were greater than 0.7 inseveral cases. The data presented in Table 2 also indicated a consistentsigniﬁcant and positive relationship between daily sunset and crime.This indicated that crime increased as sunset was delayed. This ﬁndingwas interesting because it suggested levels of crime were positivelyassociated with levels of solar illumination.Finally, the data also indicated strong relationships between levelsof crime/disorder and both average nightly temperature and levels ofprecipitation. The signiﬁcant and positive coefﬁcients for temperatureindicated that crime increased during warmer days across geograph-ical locations. Finally, a pattern emerged suggesting that whensigniﬁcant, the relationship was generally negative. This indicatedthat crime decreased on rainy nights. Interesting, the relationship forprecipitation and crime was less apparent in the entertainment areawhich might suggest that tourists were less deterred by bad weather.The bivariate analyses indicated that while all of the controlvariables were signiﬁcantly related to levels of crime and disorder,lunar phase demonstrated little explanatory power. With theexception of levels of drugs and vice in the entertainment area,lunar phase showed no signiﬁcant relationships. Moreover, thedirection of the relationships was scattered across types of disorder-ly/criminal behavior and geographical areas. Results of the bivariateanalysis seemed contrary to the lore of a lunar affect on crime anddisorder; in fact the weak drugs/vice ﬁnding in the entertainmentarea is contrary to what lore would predict. To further test thisrelationship, multivariate analysis (both ordinary least squaresregression and time series analysis) was used to understand therelationships between lunar phase and crime while controlling forother temporal, seasonal, and weather related conditions.Multivariate analysisTime-series analysis was an appropriate analytical strategy forregressing time-and-season dependent variables on independentvariables. The autoregressive integrative moving average model(ARIMA) was developed by Box and Jenkins (1976) as a methodo-logical strategy for removing trends from data. ARIMA analysisinvolves an iterative model building process where the analystdiagnoses the structure of the trend and then builds the appropriatestatistical model to these biasing effects that may distort statisticalrelationships. ARIMA models have three structural parametersthat must be diagnosed and modeled, autoregressive (p); difference(d); and moving average (q) parameters (see McDowall, McCleary,Meidinger & Hay, 1980).The ﬁrst step in constructing these models is to ensure trends arestationary. Stationary refers to the degree to which the data seriesﬂuctuates around a ﬁxed mean. A nonstationary trend is representedby a non-zero integer in the d term. The differencing process involvessubtracting a value from the preceding kth observations with krepresenting the d parameter. The autoregressive parameter reﬂectsthe mathematical relationship between an observation and kpreceding values. Finally, the moving average parameter (q) is similarTable 2Bivariate CorrelationsLunarPhaseWinter Weekend Sunset NightlyTempPrecipCity Trafﬁc -0.00 -0.27** 0.57** 0.26** 0.29** 0.05*City Burglary 0.02 -0.16** 0.24** 0.25** 0.21** 0.14**City Disturbance 0.00 -0.26** 0.79** 0.22** 0.26** -0.08**City Assault -0.02 -0.23** 0.71** 0.19** 0.25** -0.07**City Drugs/Vice -0.01 -0.32** 0.22** 0.31** 0.34** -0.09**City Theft -0.01 -0.12** 0.15** 0.14** 0.11** -0.02City Aggregated 0.00 -0.31** 0.78** 0.29** 0.32** -0.05*NonEnt Trafﬁc -0.00 -0.27** 0.55** 0.26** 0.29** 0.06*NonEnt Burglary 0.02 -0.17** 0.24** 0.25** 0.22** 0.14**NonEnt Disturbance -0.00 -0.26** 0.79** 0.23** 0.26** -0.08**NonEnt Assault -0.01 -0.23** 0.70** 0.19** 0.25** -0.07**NonEnt Drugs/Vice 0.00 -0.31** 0.19** 0.31** 0.35** -0.09**NonEnt Theft -0.00 -0.11** 0.12** 0.13** 0.11** -0.03NonEnt Aggregated 0.00 -0.31** 0.78** 0.29** 0.32** -0.05*Ent Trafﬁc 0.02 -0.11** 0.30** 0.10** 0.10** -0.01Ent Burglary 0.01 -0.01 0.08 0.03 0.01 0.06Ent Disturbance 0.01 -0.12** 0.33** 0.11** 0.10** -0.05*Ent Assault -0.03 -0.10** 0.33** 0.09** 0.08** -0.02*Ent Drugs/Vice -0.06* -0.10** 0.17** 0.09** 0.06* -0.02Ent Theft -0.04 -0.05 0.13* 0.05 0.01 0.06**Ent Aggregated -0.01 -0.13** 0.35** 0.12** 0.10** -0.03* pb.05.** pb .01.363J.A.

SPSS 14.0, however, includes a timeseries modeler that automates this process by running through aseries of iterations and identifying the best model for the data series.This modeler is useful as it reduces the level of subject interpretationassociated with identifying the proper parameter estimates (seeBushway & McDowall 2006) for a discussion on the challengesassociated with establishing causal effects in trend data).Tables 3–5 present the multivariate ﬁndings for the threegeographical areas (citywide, non-entertainment, and entertainmentareas).6 Each table includes seven different models, one for each of thecrime categories; a description of themodel types is located below thecategories. The ARIMA parameter estimates are included whenapplicable and OLS indicates a simpliﬁed regression model wasused. As indicated above, thesemodel typeswere determined throughdiagnostic procedures available in the statistical software packageused.The citywide analysis is presented in Table 3. The discussion willfocus primarily on the relationships between lunar phase and not theother control variables for reasons of brevity (seven categories ofcrime across three geographical areas). Looking across the citywideanalysis, lunar phase was signiﬁcant only for the burglary model andin the positive direction. This suggested that as lunar phase increased(i.e., the moon became more full), so did levels of burglary. While thelunar phase-crime relationship was positive across the othercategories (with the exception of assault and theft) none of thesereached statistical signiﬁcance. The relationships among the controlvariables and crime levels largely remained unchanged in themultivariate models, with the exception of sunset which wasrelegated largely insigniﬁcant across the models.The ﬁndings for the non-entertainment area are detailed inTable 4. This area includes the entire city of San Antonio minus theRiverwalk district. Similar to Table 3, these ﬁndings indicated thatlunar phase had no effect on levels of crime and disorder in SanAntonio. The relative impact of the sunset variable was alsomoderatedin these models; sunset was signiﬁcant in only the burglary and theftmodels, exerting a positive relationship in both instances.Finally, the ﬁndings for the entertainment area are presented inTable 5. Looking across the seven models, it is apparent that theseasonal, temporal, and weather-related control variables thatwere so prominent in most of the bivariate relationships and theprior two multivariate tables largely disappear in Table 5. Thissuggested that after including the additional control variables anddetrending the data, crime and disorder levels in the entertainmentdistrict were inﬂuenced to a lesser degree by these factors. Theone notable exception, not unexpectedly, was the weekend controlvariable. That is, crime and disorder levels were signiﬁcantly greaterin the entertainment area on weekends net all other controls. Thismay suggest that socialization patterns that explain the occurrenceof crime and disorder are largely “ﬁxed” regardless of the weather,temperature, and season. It is also interesting to note that while therelationships between lunar phase and crime levels were notsigniﬁcant across the models, there was one exception; the rela-tionship between lunar phase and drugs/vice was signiﬁcant andnegative. This indicates that as lunar phase increased (i.e., the moontrended toward a more full state), the reported levels of drugs andvice decreased.DiscussionLunar lore is an established aspect of western culture, though thespeciﬁcs of this belief (i.e., how and why the moon might exert aninﬂuence on human behavior) was imprecise. This study attempted todetermine whether lunar phase inﬂuenced disorderly and criminalacts as indicated by the volume of incidents reported to the policeeach night during a ﬁve year period in a major southwestern US city. Ifa presumed lunar effect was supposed to inﬂuence humans throughsome form of biosocial mechanism (Lieber, 1978b, 1996) the ﬁndingsreported here offered no real support of this supposition using thedependent variable at hand. Prior studies were conﬁrmed here; therewas no clear evidence that lunar cycles had more than marginal (andlikely spurious) explanatory power in understanding levels of crimeand disorder. Although popular culture, folk lore, and even certainoccupational lore suggested the “freaks” come out during full moons(Lieber, 1996; Rotton & Kelly, 1985; Rotton et al., 1986; Vance, 1995),this phenomenonwas not reﬂected in San Antonio police data as usedhere. Though a small number of associations were noted betweenlunar phase and various aspects of criminal and disorderly conduct,this was a common element of prior research and could have been aprobable effect of the large number of associations under consider-ation (i.e., a spurious ﬁnding). A Bonferroni correction to address thisconcern could also have been performed to decrease the possibility ofthis Type 1 error. The few statistically signiﬁcant associations thatwere detected and the impact of other variables other than the lunarphase suggest that such a procedure, while more accurate, would notsubstantively impact these ﬁndings or conclusions.This study relied on CFS, which captured the quantity of reportedincidents, but did not provide robust insights into qualitative aspectsof police encounters involving crime and disorder. CFS were good datapoints as they were immune from ofﬁcer discretion, though not call-taker discretion. It was common, however, for lunar research to focuson the volume of select forms of behavior, such as violence andaggression in prisons and psychiatric facilities (Lieber, 1978a, 1978b;Pettigrew, 1985; Templer & Veleber, 1980; Weiskott & Tipton, 1975)or calls to crisis centers (Templer & Veleber, 1980; Weiskott, 1974).This was likely a partial function of convenience; quantitative/volumeindicators of behavior were far more convenient and inexpensive thanTable 3Multivariate analysis - City Level AnalysisModel Type Trafﬁc Burglary Disturbances Assault Drugs/Vice Theft AggregatedARIMA(0,0,8) (OLS) ARIMA(0,0,8) ARIMA(7,0,8) (OLS) (OLS) ARIMA(7,0,8)B StdError B StdError B StdError B StdError B StdError B StdError B StdErrorVariableSunset 0.009 0.006 0.067* 0.009 -0.008* 0.032 -0.003 0.004 0.007* 0.003 0.002* 0.001 0.050 0.046Winter -1.738* 0.851 4.116* 1.460 -21.871* 4.701 -2.470* 0.656 -1.318* 0.412 -0.140 0.148 -23.848* 6.703Weekend 11.372* 0.403 10.361* 0.927 126.698* 2.470 15.410* 0.630 2.719* 0.261 0.602* 0.094 190.794* 4.763Nightly Temp 0.126* 0.024 0.154* 0.050 1.133* 0.139 0.138* 0.020 0.091* 0.014 0.003 0.005 2.002* 0.187Precip. 1.008* 0.407 6.510* 1.067 -16.697* 2.282 -1.814* 0.362 -1.569* 0.301 -0.133 0.108 -13.978* 2.835Lunar Phase 0.102 0.670 1.455* 1.194 2.214 3.633 -0.299 0.472 0.023 .0336 -0.006 0.121 4.083 5.144Constant -5.031 10.434 -80.994* 16.757 139.067* 57.315 13.385 7.985 -7.638 4.722 -2.772 1.699 88.983 83.023* pb .05.364 J.A.

Based on this logic,incidents occurring during times of full moon would be expectedto be more atypical and would result in a greater need for ofﬁcersto intervene with an arrest. This logic, however, allows for theintroduction of ofﬁcer discretion. Given that lunar effects areembedded in collective western beliefs (Lieber, 1996; Rotton &Kelly, 1985; Rotton et al., 1986), affects observed in areas heavilyinﬂuenced by ofﬁcer discretion (such as the decision to arrest, ﬁle anofﬁcial report, or make referrals) could suffer from social contagion(Purpura, 1979; Simon, 1998). If ofﬁcers accept that there are lunareffects (Rotton et al., 1986; Vance, 1995) they may opt for differentialhandling of situations based on lunar phase. In effect, the lunar effectwould become a self-fulﬁlling prophecy; dependent variables wouldbe inﬂuenced due to acceptance of the lore, rather than due to actualcitizen/offender behavior. For this reason, the initial classiﬁcations ofCFS represent a relatively innocuous indicator of situations brought tothe attention of the police, though they are subject to some socialcontagion among 911 call takers.The ﬁndings of this research, rather than conﬁrming a lunar-crime/disorder relationship, corroborated earlier literature establishing thatcrime varied temporally (Cohn, 1996; Heller & Markland, 1970;LeBeau & Corcoran, 1990; LeBeau & Langworthy, 1986) and due toweather (Cheatwood, 1995; Cohn, 1990b; Cohn & Rotton, 2000; Hippet al., 2004; Quételet, 1842/1969; Rotton & Cohn, 2003). Weekendsand nightly temperature were consistently and positively associatedwith aggregated levels of crime, though there was variation based onspeciﬁc offense categories. Rates of aggregated crime were muchhigher on weekends and were higher during periods of warmertemperatures. During winter months and periods of greater precip-itation, crime decreased across the city as a whole andwithin the non-entertainment areas. Interestingly, winter and precipitation did notinﬂuence aggregated crime within the entertainment district.Substantive lunar effects on crime were not found in the dataanalyzed here. If any interpretations regarding the few (and possiblyspurious) relationships were offered, a logical starting point might berational choice notions. The mechanisms of inﬂuence are likely afunction of some effects on the availability of suitable targets and theability of offenders to escape (or afford) adequate opportunities toconduct their activities. The limited inﬂuence of lunar phase in thetwo instances: (1) citywide burglary (positive relationship foundwhich might support lunar impacts) and (2) entertainment districtdrugs/vice (negative relationship found which may be interpreted toundermine lunar lore) may be suggestive of such perspectives. On thewhole, however, the data and models examined here were not ableto specify insights or details pertaining to these incidents that wouldshed light on this contention. Further scholarly inquiry considering thechoices and decisions of these types of offenders might, for example,question the role of ambient moon light in shaping offending choicesand behaviors.That noted, insistent believers in the existence of a lunar effectmay interpret this study differently and offer an alternativepossibility. One could review this study and contend that while thislunar cycle research failed to ﬁnd effects on the volume of crime, thepossibility of effects on the varying character or quality of crimesreported may remain. More precisely, lunar effects may shape not thevolume of crime encountered by police and other service providers,but rather alter the nature of problems, individuals, and circum-stances. As the data used in this study were aggregated andquantitative, they offered limited insight into these possible aspectsof the nature and character of individual incidents and the motiva-tions and/or rationales of offenders.

Only then could this question of the lunarlore and crime be more fully answered.Notes1. See Rotton and Cohn (2000) and Cohn (1990b), among others, for a discussionof theoretical and empirical relationships between weather, temporal variables, socialcontact variables, and crime.2. Block (1984) wrote that although some general seasonal trends could be noted,they tended to be offense-speciﬁc and were not evident in all jurisdictions. Hercomprehensive review of data she analyzed, as well as various published andunpublished research done by others, found ample variation in seasonal trends. Someof this might have been attributed to variable data, operational deﬁnitions, andanalytical plans.3. Researchers have employed myriad methods of structuring the timing andintensity of full moons relative to other periods of the lunar cycle. For example:contrasting the day of the full moon with all other days in the cycle (Frey et al., 1979);creating seemingly-capricious “windows” of time (i.e., three days) around the fullmoon for contrast with the rest of the cycle (sometimes separating out windows oftime around the new moon) (Walters et al., 1975); breaking cycles into equal (Frey etal., 1979; Quinsey & Varney, 1977; Taylor & Diespecker, 1972) and unequal (Frey et al.,1979; Lester et al., 1969) periods of times; and, allowing lunar phase to vary from dayto day throughout the lunar cycle (Simon, 1998). The lunar lore is ambiguousregarding whether the inﬂuence of the moon is truly restricted to full-moon periodsand whether a heightened full moon inﬂuence might be offset by a converse effectduring the new moon.4. This consideration was another complexity created by the vague nature of thelunar lore. Was the effect of the full moon mediated by its visibility due to daylightand/or weather patterns? If the effect was thought to result from the actual intensityof the moon's illumination, the answer may have been “yes.” If the effect was thoughtto result from the moons ‘pull’ on water in the human body, the answer might havebeen “no.”5. An anonymous reviewer pointed out the U.S.N.O. also reports moon rise andsetting times within archival data. It was noted using a sliding window of analysisbased on whether the moon was above the horizon might have been an alternativeapproach within the analysis. Additional analyses not reported here, but available fromthe lead author upon request, suggest the results were not substantively different withthe use of such a variable window of analysis. The original models (ﬁxed 8:00 pm –3:00 am window of analysis) were retained for the analysis reported in this article,though the alternative scheme was included in later portions of the discussion.6. The analysis was also conducted using a measure of the moon's actual visibilityabove the horizon net of atmospheric conditions that might preclude such visibility.These models yielded no signiﬁcant differences in parameter magnitudes orsigniﬁcance levels. Since the same pattern of signiﬁcant and non-signiﬁcant resultswas obtained, the initial results were retained and presented in this article.
