ABSTRACT: 
Touch screens are a key component of consumer mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, as well as an increasingly common self-service component of information retrieval on fixed screens and mobile devices in-store. The ubiquity of touch screens in daily life increases consumer accessibility and extended use for shopping, whilst software innovations have increased the functionality of touch screens, for example the extent to which images respond to fingertip control. This study examines how users engage with interactive visual rotation and tactile simulation features while browsing fashion clothing products on touch screen devices and thus contributes to retail touch screen research that previously focused on in-store kiosks and window displays. Findings show that three dimensions of user engagement (endurability, novelty and felt involvement) are positively influenced by both forms of manipulation. In order to examine the extent to which touch screen user engagement varies with individual preferences for an in-store experience, the paper also examines whether user engagement outcomes are mediated by an individual's need for physical touch. Findings indicate that the need for touch does not explain the variance between individuals. We conclude that touch screen technology complements the physical retail environment.

IntroductionTouch screens have transitioned from being present on con-sumer mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets tobecoming an increasingly popular self-service technology presentwithin the retail environment in a range of forms such as infor-mation kiosks, window displays and check-outs (Tüzün, Telli, &Alır, 2016). Touch screen technology has a strong appeal for con-sumers as it allows them to use their ﬁngertips and removes theneed for any intermediary devices (i.e. a mouse or a stylus) whenretrieving information (Benko, Wilson, & Baudisch, 2006). Surveyevidence shows that touch screen presence increases intention tovisit a physical store amongst 65% of UK consumers (Gilmartin,2016) and thus the in-store touch screen provides a competitiveresponse to online challengers (RSR, 2016a) by allowing consumerser.ac.uk (M. Blazquez Cano),chel.Ashman@liverpool.ac.ukano, M., et al., The inﬂuence o17), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016to ﬁnd out more about products or customise their shoppingexperience. The ubiquity of touch screens on both consumermobiledevices as well as being ﬁxed in-store increases consumer acces-sibility and enables extended use both in-store and outwith thestore (Gilmartin, 2016; RSR, 2016b; Shankar et al., 2016). In the UKand US, mobile trafﬁc now constitutes the greatest proportion ofecommerce trafﬁc (eMarketer, 2016) and online shopping is themost popular web browsing activity for smartphone users in the UK(Deloitte, 2016).There is a recognised need for research that examines consumerperceptions of speciﬁc touch screen features on mobile devices(Blazquez, 2014; Pantano & Priporas, 2016). For fashion retailers inparticular, ensuring the effectiveness of screen-based productviews is a widely discussed challenge (Eroglu, Karen, Machleit, &Lenita, 2001; Kim, Kim, & Lennon, 2007; Klatzky & Peck, 2012)and mobile marketing requires a distinct set of competencies(Str€om, Vendel, & Bredican, 2014). Chung's (2015) experimentalstudy found use of touch screens to browse an item of clothing ledto greater shopper engagement, which subsequently led to highersatisfaction with shopping, higher purchase intentions and morepositive product evaluations. Focusing on psychological ownership,f image interactivity upon user engagement when usingmobile touch/j.chb.2017.03.042M. Blazquez Cano et al. / Computers in Human Behavior xxx (2017) 1e72Brasel and Gips (2014) found that browsing on touch screen devicesled to higher product valuations than on PCs, concluding thatconsumer perceptions of online products are ﬁltered through thelens of the interfaces used to explore them.It is important for retailers to understand the opportunities toenrich the customer shopping experience on mobile devices andin-store touch screens, as mobile marketing requires a distinct setof competencies (Str€om et al., 2014). Touch screens have the po-tential to enhance the in-store customer experience by bringing thebeneﬁts of online shopping to ecommerce-savvy consumers(Gilmartin, 2016; RSR, 2016b). Developments in image interactivitytechnology (IIT) improve product presentation techniques byenabling customers to manipulate images in real-time rather thansimply viewing static images. For example, single- and multi-ﬁngergestures such as ﬂicking, rotating and even pinching can be used toaccess and interact with product views on touch screens(Orzechowski et al., 2012; Padilla, Orzechowski, & Chantler, 2012).IIT has a positive impact on fulﬁlling users' hedonic needs andpositively inﬂuences affective aspects of the consumer experience(Kim & Forsythe, 2007; Lee, Kim, & Fiore, 2010; Teo, Oh, Liu, &Wei,2003). Consequently, it contributes to positive attitudes towardsthe retailer (Wu, 2005). It is important to determine the extent towhich IIT innovation onmobile devices results in user engagement,since the result of failing to engage consumers could be a lost sale, adisloyal consumer or a failure to transmit information online(O'Brien & Toms, 2008). In contrast, engaged shoppers are likely topurchase more items, more frequently than non-engaged shoppers(Shankar et al., 2016). However, there is a paucity of research thatexamines consumer perceptions of speciﬁc touch screen featureson mobile devices (Blazquez, 2014).This study contributes to the literature on how differences in IITinﬂuence user engagement when browsing clothing images. It linksemerging touch screen technology to the stream of research intouser engagement commenced by O'Brien and Toms (2008; 2010;2013). The use of innovative technologies contributes toincreasing the value of online retail (Kim & Forsythe, 2007) and ifconsumers consider their browsing experience as a success and feelhighly involved in their shopping task, this should lead to anincreased intention to purchase, improvement of the overall onlineexperience, revisit intention or time spent in the website (Lee et al.,2010; Merle, Senecal,& St-Onge, 2012; Park, Lennon,& Stoel, 2005).In this study, data was gathered using a between-subjects design totest the effect of two sensory stimuli, vision and simulated touch,whilst controlling for the individual trait of need for touch whilstshopping. The remainder of this paper will explain the conceptualbackground, describe the method, report the results, discuss im-plications for practitioners and researchers and conclude withlimitations and recommendations for further research.2. Literature review2.1. User engagementThe construct of user engagement combines behavioural,cognitive and affective responses when using computer-based tools(O'Brien & Toms, 2008; Wiebe, Lamb, Hardy, & Sharek, 2014). Userengagement occurs progressively from initial “users' assessment of,and interaction with, interactive media interfaces, followed bydeeper absorption with media content and behavioral outcomes”(Oh, Bellur & Sundar, 2015, p3). User engagement is particularlysuitable as a way of understanding responses to touch screentechnology for the acquisition of product information, as it in-corporates both hedonic perceptions such as ﬂow (Trevino &Webster, 1992), utilitarian interface experiences such as perceivedusability (Davis, 1989) and task-technology ﬁt (Goodhue &Please cite this article in press as: Blazquez Cano, M., et al., The inﬂuence oscreens, Computers in Human Behavior (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016Thompson, 1995). As such, it provides a “succinct lens” throughwhich to unify and address several established strands of human-computer interaction research (Wiebe et al., 2014, p. 124).O'Brien and Toms (2010) proposed six dimensions of userengagement: (1) Aesthetics, the visual appearance of the website,(2) Endurability, perceived task-technology ﬁt resulting in intentionrecommend to others, (3) Felt Involvement, cognitive immersion intask, (4) Focussed Attention, ﬂow state that results in temporal andenvironmental disassociation, (5) Novelty, pleasurable cognitivestimulation and (6) Perceived Usability, the degree of cognitiveeffort and affective frustration experienced during use. The UserEngagement scale was developed by O'Brien and Toms (2008;2010; 2013) through a survey using the scenario of general onlineshopping activity (O'Brien & Toms, 2010) and book purchase in alaboratory experiment comprising search tasks (O'Brien & Toms,2013). However, neither study examined user engagement in thecontext of consumer acquisition of product information. The pro-cess of evaluation of alternatives is an important stage of theshopping process (Shankar et al., 2016).Continued research is needed due to the dynamic and complexnature of user engagement, the documented ﬂuidity of scale items,and the need to guage whether the measure allows meaningfulcomparison between different task contexts (O'Brien & Cairns,2015) and different application features. Research is also neededto compare user engagement in response to different sensorysoftware stimuli. There is scant research that makes ﬁner-grainedcomparison to human-computer interaction, with exceptions be-ing Visinescu Sidorova, Jones and Prybutok (2015) who examinedthe effect of 3D vs 2D image manipulation upon cognitive ab-sorption leading to purchase intention and Xu and Sundar (2016)who differentiated how interactivity and non-interactive ele-ments within a website inﬂuence cognitive processing of content.To address these gaps, the present study investigates how differentforms of IIT inﬂuence user engagement with fashion clothinginformation.2.2. Image interactivity technology and fashion retailingImage interactivity technology (IIT) is a website feature thatenables the “creation and manipulation of product or environmentimages to simulate (or surpass) actual experience with the productor environment” (Fiore, Kim, & Lee, 2005, p. 39). This is particularlyrelevant for clothing products, which suffer from sensory impov-erishment when retailed online. There has been sustained devel-opment of IIT for the fashion retailing context resulting in a range ofIIT features including the ability to rotate and zoom into productfeatures, the ability to assemble distinct clothing images into oneimage through mix and match technology, and the ability tosimulate the appearance of clothing upon a body form through avirtual ﬁtting room (Lee et al., 2010; Merle et al., 2012). Each ofthese features differs in the range of interactivity and the approx-imation to physical vision and touch (Yu, Lee, & Damhorst, 2012). Ahigh level of interactivity positively inﬂuences affective aspects ofthe consumer experience (Lee et al., 2010).Advances in IIT enable the artiﬁcial recreation of tactile and vi-sual sources of product information for more intuitive and inter-active websites, which, in turn, allow consumers to digitallyinteract with products using their ﬁngertips in a more naturalmanner than using a keyboard and mouse. It is therefore closer tothe way in which shoppers would actually interact with the item ina physical context (Orzechowski et al., 2012; Padilla et al., 2012).Overmars and Poels (2015) examined IIT that simulates strokinggestures in the context of two textile products (a scarf and ablanket) and showed that use improves product understanding.They highlighted the need for extending research to other ways inf image interactivity upon user engagement when usingmobile touch/j.chb.2017.03.042M. Blazquez Cano et al. / Computers in Human Behavior xxx (2017) 1e7 3which people handle fabrics, such as scrunching.Vision and touch make different contributions to product eval-uation (Guest & Spence, 2003; Schifferstein, Otten, Thoolen, &Hekkert, 2010). There is also a need to connect these insightsbeyond product understanding to include user engagement as anexperience that results from interaction.2.3. Inﬂuence of vision upon user engagementOnline images of merchandise are high-involvement elementsof a website (Eroglu et al., 2001). Vision is preferred to judge themacrostructural properties of a product, such as size and shape(Spence & Gallace, 2008). Visualisation technologies, such as 360product rotation, support evaluation of the shape, size, ﬂow andmovement of garments, which can lead tomore realistic judgments(Kim & Forsythe, 2007; Schlosser, 2003; Yu et al., 2012). Park et al.(2005) found 360 rotation on a website to positively affect con-sumer mood and reduce perceptions of purchase risk, leading toincreased purchase intent. Compared with static images, IIT alsoenables users to form more vivid mental images of products,resulting in more realistic judgments (Schlosser, 2003). Weformulate the following research proposition (RP) that IIT allowing360 rotation will result in a greater positive user engagementresponse than viewing static pictures.RP1. IIT serving the primary function of vision (visual rotation)has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on user engagement.2.4. Inﬂuence of touch upon user engagementTactile cues shape perception of themicrostructural features of aproduct and material information such as texture (Guest & Spence,2003; McCabe & Nowlis, 2003). IIT scrunch and pinch featuressimulate tactile interaction to provide an approximation of touch-related experience attributes such as texture and weight(Overmars & Poels, 2015). Overmars and Poels (2015) found thatsimulated stroking gestures increased perceived diagnosticity ofproduct experience attributes and increased perceptions of control.Based on this we propose:RP2. IIT serving the primary function of touch (tactile function)has a positive and signiﬁcant effect on user engagement.2.5. The relative inﬂuence of touch and vision upon userengagementIn-store, shoppers may touch, rub and crumple textiles to esti-mate qualities such as softness, stretch or roughness (Orzechowski,2010). Although there is a gap between handling a physical textileand the perceived qualities of a textile displayed on a screen(Gallace & Spence, 2014), tactile simulation in online environmentsincreases cognitive product evaluation (Daugherty, Li, & Biocca,2008). Since touch is preferred to gather information ofﬂineabout material properties, such as texture (McCabe&Nowlis, 2003;Spence & Gallace, 2008), we propose:RP3. IIT serving the primary function of touch (tactile function)has a greater impact on user engagement than IIT serving the pri-mary function of vision (visual rotation).2.6. The mediating inﬂuence of the need for touchThe need for touch (NFT) whilst shopping is an individual traitdeﬁned as “a preference for the extraction and utilization ofPlease cite this article in press as: Blazquez Cano, M., et al., The inﬂuence oscreens, Computers in Human Behavior (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016information obtained through the haptic system” (Peck & Childers,2003, p. 431). Individuals with a high NFT are more likely to accesshaptic or touch-based information than those individuals with alower NFT. Peck and Childers (2003) also differentiated betweenthose who touch products for the sensory pleasure of the experi-ence, and the instrumental dimension related to those who touchfor a rational purpose. As such, NFT plays an important role in theconsumer's choice of shopping channel (Citrin, Stem, Spangenberg,& Clark, 2003) so that individuals with a high NFT are unlikely toﬁnd online shopping desirable for products that encourage tactileinteraction (Dennis, Jayawardhena,& Papamatthaiou, 2010). Hence,we propose that NFT will mediate the degree of user engagementthat is experienced when using IIT for vision and touch:RP4. NFT will mediate the relationship between IIT use and userengagement.3. Methodology3.1. Design and participantsA between-subjects experiment with two levels of imageinteractivity (visual rotation and simulated tactile scrunch) wasconducted to understand the effects of different IIT features on userengagement. A total of 218 student subjects participated and wererecruited from two UK universities with an incentive of entry into aprize draw for a £50 online shopping voucher. A student samplewas chosen to reﬂect trends in online shopping patterns in the UKwhich show that younger consumers (16e24 years old) buy moreclothes online than in-store (Mintel, 2014). The achieved samplewere predominantly female (87%), had purchased online in the lastsix months (89%) and browsed online for fashion every week (77%).These characteristics reﬂect statistics which indicate that morefemale than male shoppers use mobile devices when browsing andpurchasing clothes online (Mintel, 2014).3.2. Materials and procedureA digital tool called Shoogleit (Padilla & Chantler, 2011) wasused to create interactive product visualisations from pre-recordedvideo by merging visual and tactile inputs (see Fig. 1). Shoogleitadds user-controlled interactivity to any object on a touch screen bymerging user gestures on mobile devices with animations match-ing the gesture on a real object. The garments selectedwere a ladieschiffon dress and a mens cotton shirt. Pilot tests amongst 20 par-ticipants determined that the garments and fabrics selected wereperceived as having visual and tactile attributes (Overmars & Poels,2015). To control for model preference in the visual treatment, themodels’ heads were cropped.We used a two-step procedure with the experimental treatmentfollowed by a self-completed paper questionnaire. After givinginformed consent, participants were randomly allocated to eitherthe control, vision or touch experimental groups. Female partici-pants were assigned to the chiffon dress and male participantswere assigned to the cotton shirt. Established principles of exper-imental research design (Field & Hole, 2002) were followed. Ex-periments took place in rooms with no other stimuli that couldaffect the results. In each group, each subject was asked to browsethe clothing item on an iPad for up to 5 min as if evaluating it forpossible purchase and then after browsing, given the paper ques-tionnaire to complete within 15 min.The control group (n ¼ 46) were given static images of the frontand back of the garment on the model to view on an iPad (seeFig. 2). The vision group (n ¼ 79) used Shoogleit rotate technologyon an iPad. This allowed them to use their ﬁngertips to rotate thef image interactivity upon user engagement when usingmobile touch/j.chb.2017.03.042Fig. 1.

Chiffon fabric and shirt fabric “scrunch” tactile simulation.M. Blazquez Cano et al. / Computers in Human Behavior xxx (2017) 1e74model in the garment through 360 (see Fig. 3). The touch group(n ¼ 92) used Shoogleit scrunch technology on an iPad, whichenabled them to pinch and scrunch a section of the clothing fabricwith their ﬁngertips (see Fig. 4). This group was also provided witha laminated picture of the front and back view of the garment onthe model so they could relate the fabric section to the wholegarment.3.3. Measures3.3.1. User engagementUser Engagement was measured through the application of 10items drawn from the highest factor loading items of O'Brien andToms' (2010) User Engagement scale. Responses were measuredon a 7 point Likert scale (1 ¼ totally disagree to 7 ¼ totally agree).Fig. 3. Ladies chiffon dress and mens shirt visual rotation.Please cite this article in press as: Blazquez Cano, M., et al., The inﬂuence oscreens, Computers in Human Behavior (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016Five of the six proposed dimensions of user engagement wereselected. “Aesthetics” was dropped since this sub-scale measuresresponse to the visual quality of the shopping website as a whole,whilst this study focuses upon an isolated website feature and notthe total site. Scale reliability was acceptable with a Cronbach'salpha value of 0.78, which is comfortably over the suggested a of 0.7(De Vellis, 2003) and scores were calculated for an overall measureof user engagement. The User Engagement scale data was normallydistributed.3.3.2. Need for touchNFT was measured on a 7 point likert scale (1 ¼ totally disagreeto 7 ¼ totally agree) with 6 items adapted from Peck and Childers'(2003) scale, which contained three items each relating to sensoryand instrumental dimensions (Lee, Chang & Cheng, 2014). The NFTscale was reliable with Cronbach's alpha value of 0.79. The NFT datashowed slight negative skewness and kurtosis. However, this isunlikely to make a signiﬁcant difference to the analysis, and withlarge samples, the risk of an underestimation of variance is low(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013).f image interactivity upon user engagement when usingmobile touch/j.chb.2017.03.042M. Blazquez Cano et al. / Computers in Human Behavior xxx (2017) 1e7 54. ResultsThe data analysis reports the main effects between UserEngagement and IIT (scrunch and rotate) and exploreswhether NFTacts as a covariate for this relationship.4.1. Inﬂuence of vision and touch on user engagementTable 1 presents the mean scores for each of the experimentalconditions. Columns give each experimental condition and rowsshow measures for the dimensions of user engagement accordingto O'Brien and Toms (2010). The ﬁrst column shows the controlcondition, where participants viewed only static images. The re-sults show the lowest mean average of 1.34 for novelty, which in-dicates that participants tended to totally disagree that they feltcuriosity or interest during their browsing experience. There was atendency to somewhat disagree that static images providedfocused attention, which comprises experiences of ﬂow and taskabsorption. In contrast, there was total agreement that thebrowsing experience using static images delivered perceived us-ability and a tendency to somewhat agree that there was feltendurability and felt involvement. This means that participantstended to agree that they felt in control and not frustrated ormentally taxed when viewing static images and also felt that theirgoals had been successfully achieved and remained involved in thebrowsing experience.The second column shows the average means for the visualrotation condition with the lowest mean of 3.15 for focusedattention, which indicates that participants did not feel high im-mersion in the browsing taskwhile using this technology. However,they somewhat agreed with felt involvement, endurability andperceived the technology as novel compared to the static pictures.The highest mean of 5.52 is for the perceived usability construct,even higher than its mean for the tactile simulation condition,which shows the importance of visual simulation for productjudgement.The third column shows the average mean for the tactilesimulation/scrunch condition. With the exception of perceivedusability, this condition comprises the highest averagemeans for allconstructs, demonstrating that scrunch technology focuses atten-tion, generates involvement and endurability and is perceived asnovel.A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test dif-ference in user engagement between participant groups (Table 2).Results show that there is a signiﬁcant effect of experimentalcondition (static picture, rotation, scrunch) upon user engagement(F (2,112) ¼ 8.55, p¼.00 (r ¼ 0.07). Planned contrasts using Tukey'sHSD test shows that there were signiﬁcantly different scores be-tween the control condition (static picture) and the treatmentgroups (rotate and scrunch), but that there was not a signiﬁcantdifference in user engagement between the rotate and scrunchcondition. Results support RP1 and RP2 in that both rotate andscrunch IIT have a positive and signiﬁcant effect on user engage-ment. However, there is no support for RP3 as there is no statisti-cally signiﬁcant difference between the scrunch (touch) and rotateTable 1Means for each user engagement dimension.Dimension (a) Control conditionFocussed Attention 2.59Felt Involvement 4.26Endurability 4.50Novelty 1.34Perceived Usability 5.62Please cite this article in press as: Blazquez Cano, M., et al., The inﬂuence oscreens, Computers in Human Behavior (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016(visual) conditions.Differences in types of interaction are more apparent whenexamining the means for all dimensions (Table 1), with the highestmean always seen for the scrunch (touch) condition, followed byrotate (vision). The biggest differences between the twowere foundin the “involvement” and “novelty” constructs. Static (control)pictures were always the lowest. This indicates that providing IITfor consumers when browsing clothing on a touch screen helpsthem to feel more engaged, hence there is support for both RP1 andRP2. However, the difference between rotate and scrunch conditionis not statistically signiﬁcant and thus RP3, which hypothesizedthat tactile simulation would have a greater impact upon userengagement than visual rotation, is not supported. This may beexplained by respondents wishing to interact with and seewith thewhole garment rather than just a section of the fabric. This seemscommensurate with the physical experience of shopping forclothes, since consumers may be more likely to pick up a garmenton a hanger and turn it around rather than feeling the fabric.4.2. Mediating inﬂuence of need for touchA one-way between-groups ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)was conducted to understandwhether NFT during browsing had aneffect on respondents' User Engagement when using IIT. The Lev-ene's test of equality of error variances showed that we did notviolate assumptions; our variances were not equal (p ¼ 0.27). Thecovariate NFTwas not signiﬁcantly related to user engagement (F, 2,214 ¼ 0.74, p ¼ 0.39, r ¼ 0.06) but there remained a signiﬁcanteffect of IIT upon user engagement after controlling for NFT (F (2,214) ¼ 8.26, p ¼ 0.00, partial eta squared ¼ 0.072). Therefore, RP4was not supported. NFT does not act as a covariate between IITand user engagement, which suggests that the IIT succeeds in ful-ﬁlling a tactile function.5. DiscussionThis paper contributes empirical evidence of user engagementwith touch screen interactivity. Results show that visual rotationand tactile simulation features on a touch screen, speciﬁcally aniPad, contribute to an increase in user engagement when comparedto a static image. Our work makes a methodological contributionboth in its adaption of the O'Brien and Toms (2010) User Engage-ment scale but also through showing that a reduced scale of 10items is reliable.The results conﬁrm that the presence of IIT contributes to ahigher level of user engagement and therefore provides a means ofincreasing the multisensory enjoyment and entertainment value ofbrowsing on a touch screen. Even if IIT cannot fully translate thephysical properties of clothing to the touch screen, it neverthelesscontributes to improving the tactile information related to high-involvement components for fashion consumers (Eroglu et al.,2001) and product features that are related to touch properties(McCabe & Nowlis, 2003).This paper makes two theoretical contributions: ﬁrstly by con-necting emerging touch screen technology to a relatively new(b) Visual rotation (c) Tactile simulation3.15 3.324.91 5.405.11 5.084.63 4.955.56 5.45f image interactivity upon user engagement when usingmobile touch/j.chb.2017.03.042Table 2Results of Post Hoc Comparison of IIT use on User Engagement.Dependent variable (a) Control condition (b) Visual rotation (c) Tactile simulationUser Engagement 4.15* (b, c) 4.71* (a) 4.71* (a)Notes: *p<0.05 Superscript letters a, b, or c indicate those conditions that are signiﬁcantly different from the mean value.M.

The devices used in online shopping have evolved from PCto mobile and as a result, retailers need to redesign interaction toenhance the user experience (Bilgihan, Kandampully, & Zhang,2016). The challenge here is related on the one hand to the devel-opment of technologies capable of delivering credible and reliabletactile sensations over distance, and on the other to the use mar-keting strategies that somehow allow people to ‘touch beforebuying’. Our experiment uses an iPad touch screen device which isreadily available on the market for use by retailers.We show that Shoogleit IIT provides a way of overcoming thelack of physical experience for online retailers of fabric and apparelproducts. We show that IIT enables the consumer to evaluate theproduct and so increases user engagement, which is a holisticmeasure of both hedonic and instrumental responses to the mobilebrowsing process, reducing the physical-digital divide and thusenabling retailers to create engaging shopping websites. Resultssuggest that consumer uptake of IIT for browsing fabric and apparelproducts on touch screens would be positive, given the greater levelof engagement that was experienced in the two experimentalconditions, compared to the control condition where only staticpictures were presented. Since engagement with the technology isone of the main factors inﬂuencing consumers to choose onewebsite or application over others (Calder, Malthouse, & Schaedel,2009), retailers should provide augmented types of IIT to create amore immersive mobile shopping experience.Shoogleit IIT provides a way of overcoming the lack of physicalexperience for online retailers of fabric products. By adopting suchtechnology, online retailers of fabric and apparel products couldpotentially increase the value of product information presented,engage their consumers more effectively in an active shoppingexperience, increase the number of unique and repeat trafﬁc visi-tors for a site, and ultimately establish an online competitiveadvantage. Furthermore, better virtual product experiences couldenhance how consumers learn by saving time and eliminatingunnecessary information. By using IIT, online retailers could beginto establish a virtual product experience that alters the way con-sumers interact with products and mimics the physical shoppingexperience to a greater degree than seen before.6. Limitations and suggestions for future researchWe acknowledge that our research is limited by the fact thatparticipants interacted with the technology in an experimentalsetting and therefore the general set-up of the study did not fullyrepresent the natural context of online browsing and shopping.Future research might be replicated using ﬁeld trials either in thehome environment over an extended period of time of in a retailenvironment where goods might not be physically available due toPlease cite this article in press as: Blazquez Cano, M., et al., The inﬂuence oscreens, Computers in Human Behavior (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016stock limitations. Data was gathered using a self-report survey andfuture research might supplement this method with eye-trackerdata or galvanic response sensors to provide greater insight intothe inﬂuence of online stimulation on consumer behaviour.Overall however, our results provide support for future researchthat seeks to develop commercially viable (and realistic) touchscreen interfaces that could bring the tactile attributes of thephysical shopping experience to online shopping. The rapiddevelopment of mobile augmented reality suggests that there ispotential for retail settings to become smarter and add customervalue (Dacko, 2016). Incremental advances in technology, such asIIT, contribute to bridging the gap between a static experience and atruly haptic one. To conclude, this study connects with a growingliterature on engagement as a behavior across a range of devicesand applications. The results provide a foundation for additionalresearch into the role of visual and tactile interactivity within thebroader ﬁeld of user engagement and immersion.7. Conclusion and implicationsThis study examined how user engagement is related to IIT vi-sual (product rotation) and touch-related features (fabric scrunch)when browsing fashion apparel. In addition, we tested the extent towhich the need for touch strengthens or weakens any identiﬁedrelationship. Data was collected using a two-step experimentaldesign which tested the differences in user-engagement betweenthree conditions: static image (the control condition), productrotation and scrunch. Empirical results provide three insights (1)the presence of IIT results in increased user engagement comparedto the control condition, (2) visual or touch-related features areequal in their effect (3) a user's need for touch does not affect theirengagement response to IIT. The implication for retailers is that IITcan create an immersive shopping experience that overcomes theneed for physical touch and thus improves the quality of the onlineshopping experience. The implications for researchers of human-computer interaction are that IIT satisﬁes the sensory need fortouch and thus there is a scope to revisit prior research into theinﬂuence of individual psychological traits upon technologyresponse.AcknowledgementThis work did not receive any speciﬁc grant from fundingagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-proﬁt sectors.ReferencesBenko, H., Wilson, A.
