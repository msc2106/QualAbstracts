ABSTRACT: 
Tidal marsh sediments from south-central Chile provide evidence for multiple great earthquakes. Diatom transfer functions, statistical models of the relationship between species preserved in the sediment and elevation, provide quantitative estimates of coseismic vertical land-level change associated with individual earthquakes. However, in south-central Chile, our ability to quantify land-level change is currently limited by a lack of understanding of the environmental variables controlling the distribution of diatoms, an essential prerequisite for converting variations in fossil diatom assemblages into quantitative estimates of past elevation changes. We present a new modern diatom dataset for the region and explore the implications of the scale of the dataset used in transfer function models on the reconstructions of land-level change. Modern training sets containing samples from a regional scale are superior to sub-regional and local-scale training sets, providing closer estimates for known deformation during the great 1960 Chilean earthquake, a higher proportion of good modern analogues and uncertainty terms up to 42% smaller than previously published reconstructions.

The litho- and biostratigraphy of tidalmarshes may preserve a record of the vertical component ofdeformation (e.g. Atwater, 1987; Zong et al., 2003), and havebeen used to quantify the magnitude of coseismic uplift orsubsidence and reconstruct the occurrence of earthquakes overmulti-millennial timescales (e.g. Combellick, 1991; Nelson et al.,1996; Shennan et al., 1996; Sawai et al., 2004; Hamilton andShennan, 2005). Such palaeoseismic records provide long-termperspectives on the recurrence, magnitude and variability ofearthquakes occurring along subduction zones and contribute toseismic hazard assessments (e.g. Wesson et al., 2007; Muelleret al., 2015). Sedimentary and biostratigraphic evidence attests tothe occurrence of past episodes of coseismic deformation andtsunami inundation along the Chilean subduction zone (Atwateret al., 1992; Bartsch-Winkler and Schmoll, 1993; Cisternas et al.,2005; Nelson et al., 2009; Garrett et al., 2013, 2015; Dura et al.,2015). However, incomplete understanding of present-day tidalmarsh environments currently limits our ability to accuratelyquantify land-level changes. Quantitative methods for reconstruct-ing land-level change are based on uniformitarianism and theassumption that the relationships between contemporary organ-isms and their environment can be used to reconstruct pastenvironments (Birks, 1995; Birks et al., 2010). Diatoms (unicellu-lar algae) are widely used for this purpose due to their verticalzonation in intertidal environments, as well as their high preserva-tion potential in coastal sediments (for full reviews see Pilarczyket al., 2014 and Dura et al., 2016). In Chile, modern diatom dataare available only from a limited number of sites (Nelson et al.,2009; Garrett et al., 2013; Sawai et al., 2017). Consequently, aswe attempt to reconstruct palaeoseismic deformation at new sitesor further back in time, our models may be limited by not havinga modern-day equivalent of the past environment we are trying toreconstruct. Particularly in environments which have undergonerapid decimetre- to metre-scale land-level change during anearthquake, the present-day marsh may not provide a goodmodern analogue for an entire fossil sequence. In addition,reconstructions of past land-level change can also vary dependingon the spatial scale of investigation, and whether fossil diatomassemblages are compared to modern samples collected from thesame marsh, or from a regional ensemble of samples (Horton andEdwards, 2005; Watcham et al., 2013).This paper seeks to improve understanding of modernintertidal diatom distributions in south-central Chile, the regionthat produced the world’s largest recorded earthquake, themagnitude 9.5 Valdivia earthquake in 1960. This will allowmore accurate and precise quantification of palaeoseismicdeformation using a transfer function approach. We aim tosummarize modern diatom distributions from four new tidalmarsh sites, combine these data with previously publisheddiatom distributions from two sites on Isla Chiloe (Garrettet al., 2013) and investigate the relationship between diatomassemblages and elevation. Following the approach appliedby Watcham et al. (2013) in Alaska, we create a series ofmodern datasets structured by spatial scale, and investigate theimplications of using modern data from local, sub-regionaland regional scales on model performance and coseismicdeformation reconstructions. Finally, we assess the viability ofusing our expanded modern training set for reconstructingdeformation associated with past great earthquakes.Study area and methodsTidal marsh sitesTidal marsh sediments are excellent recorders of changes inrelative sea level (Barlow et al., 2013); in a region ofCorrespondence to: E.

DOI: 10.1002/jqs.2933palaeoseismicity, sequences of organic soils interbeddedwith minerogenic units reflect vertical deformation through-out the earthquake deformation cycle. The sedimentarysignatures of seismic land-level change are described in detailelsewhere (e.g. Atwater, 1987; Darienzo and Peterson, 1990;Shennan et al., 1996; Cisternas et al., 2005; Hamilton andShennan, 2005; Garrett et al., 2015), along with criteria usedto differentiate organic–minerogenic couplets of seismicorigin from those potentially deposited by other non-seismicsedimentary, fluvial, oceanographic or atmospheric pro-cesses, particularly storms (Nelson et al., 1996; Witter et al.,2001; Shennan et al., 2016). Tidal marshes may also preserveevidence for tsunami inundation through the emplacementof laterally extensive sand sheets; the identification of thesedeposits provides an additional criterion for inferring aseismic origin for sedimentary couplets (Nelson et al., 1996;Witter et al., 2001; Shennan et al., 2016).We focus our investigation on tidal marsh sites within the1960 earthquake rupture area, along the Chilean subduc-tion zone (37.5–46˚S; Fig. 1). The 1960 rupture causeduplift in a predominantly offshore belt and up to 2m ofsubsidence on the coast (Plafker and Savage, 1970; Fig. 1).Studied south-central Chile tidal marshes were chosen fortwo reasons: (i) previously published works demonstratetheir potential as good sedimentary recorders, especiallycompared to those of central Chile (May et al., 2013), and(ii) detailed observations of land-level change in 1960 areavailable with which we can compare our diatom-basedreconstructions (Table 1).We combine new modern diatom data from four tidalmarsh sites in south-central Chile  Queule, Rı́o Lingue,Isla del Rey and Chaihuı́n  with those already publishedfrom two sites on Isla Chiloe (Quilo and Estero Guillingo;Supplementary Information, Fig. S1; Garrett et al., 2013).We then use this new modern dataset to quantitativelyreconstruct land-level change associated with the 1960earthquake at five sites  Rı́o Lingue, Chaihuı́n, Pucatrihue,Llico and Rı́o Maullı́n (Fig. 1). We also re-quantify land-level change at three previously investigated sites(Rı́o Andalien, Rı́o Tirua and Chucalen; Garrett et al., 2013,2015) using the newly expanded modern diatom trainingset. All the tidal marshes sampled occupy sheltered embay-ments alongside estuaries, and in the case of Chaihuı́n,Pucatrihue and Llico, large sand spits provide furthershelter from the ocean (Fig. 1B). Their sheltered locationspromote the development of tidal marshes and the accumu-lation of fine-grained sediments, increasing the potential topreserve evidence of seismic land-level changes. All thestudied marshes are connected to and are close to the sea(<2 km), meaning modern diatoms should respond to tidalflooding. Finally, none of the modern sample sites wereaffected by coseismic deformation or ongoing post-seismicdeformation associated with the 2010 Maule earthquakefurther north.Figure 1.

Quaternary Sci., Vol. 32(3) 396–415 (2017)A NEW MODERN DIATOM DATASET FOR EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION IN CHILE 397Field and laboratory methodsTo obtain a training set of modern diatom assemblages, inJanuary 2013 we sampled at low tide the top 1 cm ofsediment (after removing the surface film) at regular verticalintervals (every 5 cm, with the exception of the highestmarsh at Chaihuı́n, which we sampled at 10 cm verticalintervals). We took modern samples along transects perpen-dicular to the direction of tidal inundation, covering the fullenvironmental gradient from unvegetated mudflat to fresh-water marsh. Additional details on modern sampling loca-tions and dominant marsh vegetation are included inFig. S1. The number of samples taken per transectdepended on the elevation gradient of the marsh. Marshfront exposures, pits, gouge and Russian cores providedstratigraphic evidence for past earthquakes. At all sites weemployed transects of cores to assess the lateral continuityand abruptness of sedimentary couplets and the presence oftsunami-deposited sand sheets. We interpreted couplets asindicative of coseismic subsidence only where organic peatis abruptly overlain by sediment indicative of a lowerelevation in cores correlated over tens to hundreds ofmetres (Table S1), with diatom and chronological analyses(discussed below) providing further lines of evidence (cf.Nelson et al., 1996; Shennan et al., 2016). We interpretedsand sheets as being indicative of tsunami deposition onthe basis of key characteristics (e.g. abrupt lower and uppercontacts, often with flattened vegetation rooted in theunderlying unit, laterally extensive, landward thinning,upward fining, rip-up clasts, mixed diatom assemblages,following Morton et al., 2007; Peters and Jaffe, 2010; Engeland Br€uckner, 2011). We levelled each modern sample andfossil core location to a benchmark and related this tomean sea level (MSL) by comparison of tidal measurementsfrom an ultrasound tide gauge (Wesson et al., 2014)deployed at each field site with the nearest permanent tidegauge station (IOC Sea Level Station Monitoring Facility;Table 2). To allow for differences in tidal range betweensites, we convert sample elevations to a standardizedwater level index (SWLI), whereby an SWLI value of 100represents MSL and 200 represents mean higher high water(MHHW) (following Hamilton and Shennan, 2005):SWLIn ¼100ðhn  hMSLÞhMHHW  hMSLþ 100 ð1Þwhere: SWLIn is the standardized water level index of samplen, hn is the elevation of sample n (in metres), hMSL is meansea level at the site (in metres) and hMHHW is mean higherhigh water at the site (in metres).We analysed modern and fossil samples for diatoms, due totheir well-documented utility in relative sea-level reconstruc-tion, which is based on the relationship between species andelevation (Nelson and Kashima, 1993; Zong and Horton,1998, 1999; Sherrod, 1999). Due to varying tolerances tosalinity, the frequency and duration of tidal inundation, andsediment type, we expect diatom assemblages to showdistinct vertical zonation across a tidal marsh (Fig. S1).

Accuracy of measurements was considered good(0.2m) where both pre- and post-earthquake vegetation lines were sharply defined, and fair (0.4m) where only one limit was clearly defined.Similarly, the accuracy of tidal measurements was considered good where there was reasonable certainty of pre-earthquake extreme high tidesrelative to fixed markers in bedrock areas, and fair where pre-earthquake tide levels could only be approximately located (Plafker and Savage,1970).Table 2.

Quaternary Sci., Vol. 32(3) 396–415 (2017)398 JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCEcan use the contemporary relationships between species andmarsh surface elevation to relate the changes we see in fossildiatom assemblages to changes in the elevation of the marshsurface in the past using a transfer function approach (see‘Transfer functions’). We prepared samples for diatom analy-sis following standard methods (Palmer and Abbott, 1986)and counted a minimum of 250 diatom valves per sample.We confirmed that sedimentary organic–minerogenic cou-plets relate to the 1960 earthquake by a combination ofaccelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating, localtestimony and elevated caesium-137 concentrations in or-ganic soils immediately below sand layers, attributed tonuclear weapons testing that began in the early 1950s andreached its maximum radioactive fallout in 1963 (Penningtonet al., 1973; Arnaud et al., 2006). For the last of these, wecompared caesium-137 concentrations in the sample imme-diately underlying the sand layer with background concen-trations in an additional deeper sample. For radiocarbondating, we selected above-ground parts of terrestrial plantsthat were horizontally bedded within the sediment matrix,and calibrated dates in OxCal (version 4.2) using the post-bomb atmospheric southern hemisphere calibration curve(Hua and Barbetti, 2004).Where cores had been previously collected, described anddated (Rı́o Andalien, Rı́o Tirua, Rı́o Maullı́n and Chucalen),diatom assemblages were recalibrated using the new moderndiatom training set.Transfer functionsDevelopmentTo reconstruct changes in marsh surface elevation acrossobserved sedimentary transitions in our fossil sequences, weuse a diatom-based transfer function. This is a two-stageprocess involving regression to establish the present-dayrelationship between diatom species and elevation, and thencalibration to use the modelled contemporary relationship toquantify the palaeomarsh surface elevation (PMSE) associatedwith each fossil sample.Detrended canonical correspondence analysis confirmsthere is a unimodal species response to elevation in themodern environment at all sites (environmental gradientlengths >2 standard deviations; Table 3). Therefore, weuse the weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS)regression technique that is recommended where species–environment relationships are non-linear, with bootstrappingcross-validation to obtain sample-specific errors (ter Braakand Juggins, 1993; Birks, 1995).We select the model with the strongest and most linearcorrelation between observed and predicted elevation values,which at the same time minimizes the root mean square errorof prediction (RMSEP) and maximum bias. As increasing thenumber of model components can lead to over-fitting, wherethe differences in model performance are small and ambigu-ous, we follow the principle of parsimony and choose the‘minimal adequate model’, i.e. the one with fewest parame-ters (Crawley, 2005; Juggins and Birks, 2012). As well asconsidering the model performance measures, we alsoconsider the effects on species optima as increasing compo-nents are added (cf. Wright et al., 2011). We then apply ourchosen transfer function model to the fossil samples andconvert the resulting PMSE estimates from SWLI units tometres by rearranging Eqn (1). To quantify coseismic defor-mation, we subtract the reconstructed pre-earthquake PMSEfrom the post-earthquake PMSE, and correct for sedimentaccumulation, including tsunami deposition. The associated95% (2s) error term is the square root of the sum of thesquared sample-specific standard errors for pre- and post-earthquake samples. It is not known whether tsunami sandemplacement is associated with erosion of the pre-earthquakemarsh. Therefore, reconstructions of coseismic subsidenceand uplift should be regarded as minima and maxima,respectively. However, as reconstructed PMSEs of pre-earthquake samples used for reconstructing coseismic land-level change and those samples immediately below areconsistent at each site to within a maximum of 9 cm (2 cm atfive out of eight sites), this suggests minimal pre-earthquakePMSE variation and therefore the impact on reconstructionsof any potential erosion of the pre-earthquake marsh is likelyto be minimal.EvaluationWe assess the reliability of our reconstructions through(i) numerical evaluation, (ii) comparison with field observa-tions where available and (iii) investigation of the elevationsignatures of principal diatom taxa in the modern environ-ment. We use the modern analogue technique (MAT) toquantify the similarity between each fossil sample and themodern training set (Birks, 1995). We aim to select moderntraining sets that provide the most fossil samples with good,or at least close, modern analogues, whereby we define‘good’ and ‘close’ as the 5th and 20th percentiles, respec-tively, of dissimilarity values for the modern samples (Simp-son, 2007; Watcham et al., 2013). A minimum dissimilaritycoefficient (minDC) of zero indicates the fossil and its closestmodern samples are exactly similar, and the coefficientincreases with increasing dissimilarity (Jackson and Williams,2004). We developed the transfer function and performedthe MAT using the C2 software package (version 1.7.3,Juggins, 2011).Scale and sample selectionThere is ongoing debate about the scale of modern trainingsets to use in transfer function reconstruction, between localmodels that generally give lower sample-specific errors versusregional models that generally do a better job of providingfossil samples with modern analogues as the difference in agebetween modern and fossil samples increases (Gehrels et al.,2001; Horton and Edwards, 2005; Nelson et al., 2008;Woodroffe and Long, 2010; Wilson and Lamb, 2012;Watcham et al., 2013). Some studies advocate using localtraining sets, on the basis that using regional modern datasetsreduces precision and increases variability in diatom assemb-lages not related to elevation (Woodroffe and Long, 2010),while others favour a regional approach, especially whenreconstructing relative sea-level change over longer periodsup to thousands of years (Gehrels et al., 2001; Horton andEdwards, 2005; Nelson et al., 2008; Watcham et al., 2013;Sawai et al., 2016). Here we assess the (dis)similarity ofmodern samples from different sites using the unconstrainedordination technique detrended correspondence analysis(DCA) and cluster analysis (performed in PRIMER; Clarke andGorley, 2015), and then aim to add to this local versusregional debate by comparing reconstructions based onmodern training sets from both scales.Following Birks (1998), we include all species in themodels. While the distribution of some species in the modernsamples may not be primarily controlled by elevation, theremay also be variation in fossil assemblages explained byfactors other than elevation. We do, however, investigate theeffect of excluding samples based on elevation.Copyright # 2017 The Authors. Journal of Quaternary Science Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. J.

Below 200 SWLI, the assemblages aredominated by Fragilaria construens var. venter, Naviculatenera, Opephora pacifica, Opephora schulzii, Planothidiumdelicatulum var. delicatula and Pseudostaurosira perminuta.There is a noticeable decline in the abundance of salt-tolerantspecies and increase in freshwater species above MHHW(200 SWLI). The species that dominate below MHHW havebroad elevation tolerances reflecting either cosmopolitandistributions and salinity tolerances or reworking and redistri-bution of diatom valves. We acknowledge that these specieswill be less useful in transfer function reconstructions but donot exclude them from modern training sets as this mixture ofin situ and reworked valves will also occur in fossil sedi-ments. Overall, we see more variable and species-richassemblages above MHHW and relatively low species diver-sity and the dominance of key taxa at lower elevationsbelow MSL.Species distributions are generally similar across the mod-ern training sets from different locations, although there aresome notable exceptions. In particular, there are a number ofspecies unique to, or found in higher abundances at, Quiloand Estero Guillingo on Isla Chiloe (e.g. Cocconeis scutellum,Diadesmis contenta, Eunotia paludosa, Fragilaria construensvar. venter, Navicula atomus, Pinnularia intermedia, Sell-aphora pupula). This could reflect altered nutrient availability,as the tidal flats are used for algal harvesting, or could relateto differences in sediment type or salinity. DCA confirms thesimilarity between samples from sites within the Araucanı́a(Queule) and Los Rı́os regions (Rı́o Lingue, Isla del Rey,Chaihuı́n), and between samples from Isla Chiloe (Fig. 3).However, clusters from Isla Chiloe and Araucanı́a/Los Rı́osoccupy discrete areas of the DCA sample plot, suggestingthere are regional differences between the diatom assemb-lages. Therefore, we base the groupings of modern trainingsets on regions. From the six local training sets, we combineQueule, Rı́o Lingue, Isla del Rey and Chaihuı́n to form aFigure 2.

We then combine all samples to form a regionalmodern training set for south-central Chile. The limitedspatial variability in the elevation optima of the principaldiatom taxa further justifies the compilation of a combinedregional modern training set (Fig. 4B,C). The elevation optimaof all principal diatom species (>15% of at least one samplein the regional training set) vary by less than 25 SWLI units(one-quarter of the difference between MHHW and MSL)between sub-regional and regional training sets, with threenotable exceptions of Navicula cincta, Navicula phylleptaand Cymbella pusilla with variable optima of 50 SWLI(Fig. 4C). We discuss the impact on reconstructions of thesespecies under ‘Assessing the optimum spatial scale of themodern training’ and ‘Do Chilean tidal marshes underesti-mate coseismic deformation?’.Transfer function developmentSummary statistics of WA-PLS regression show that for mostof the training sets, the two-component model performs best(Table 3). For the Chiloe and regional datasets, the additionof a third component improves the RMSEP by 5%, andthis is frequently used as the criterion to justify selection ofa more complex three-component model (Birks, 1998).However, here we also investigate the effect of modelcomponent selection on species optima and ultimatelyon reconstructions (following Wright et al., 2011).Figure 4A shows that many of the elevation optima (betacoefficients) of principal diatom species (those comprising>15%) are strongly distorted when using component 3. Atsites where fossil assemblages are dominated by speciessuch as Diadesmis contenta, whose optima are significantlyaltered by the addition of a third component (e.g. Puca-trihue and Rı́o Maullı́n), we see that reconstructions ofland-level change are consistent across different spatialscales using a two-component model, but differ when weapply the three-component model (Table 5; Fig. 4c). Thislatter variation is therefore likely to be a function ofassemblage-specific optima updates distorting reconstruc-tions using the third component, and we therefore cannotjustify the application of component 3 solely on the groundsof improved model performance statistics.Likewise, we also justify using two-component over one-component models on the basis that at some sites (e.g. Rı́oLingue, Chaihuı́n, Chucalen) there appears to be real varia-tion, rather than the apparent variation described above,between fossil reconstructions using training sets from differ-ent scales (Table 5). Variations in the reconstructions aretherefore likely to be a result of improved modern analoguesrather than a shifting of species optima. We are thereforejustified in using the two-component model, which has theadvantage over the one-component model of improvingmodel performance (reducing error and biases in predictedvalues), and being less susceptible to the ‘edge effects’ ofweighted averaging that can lead to non-linear distortions atthe end of particularly long environmental gradients (terBraak and Juggins, 1993; Juggins and Birks, 2012). We do,however, still recommend viewing the reconstructions withcaution where the fossil records are dominated by cosmopoli-tan diatom species with an inconsistent elevation signatureacross different modern tidal marshes, e.g. Navicula cinctaand Navicula phyllepta (Fig. 4B).We chose to exclude samples below SWLI values of 125,as below this threshold the transfer function does not do wellat predicting elevation (Fig. 5), and the implications of thisare discussed below (‘Do Chilean tidal marshes underesti-mate coseismic deformation?’). Above this threshold, there isa linear correlation between elevations predicted by thesecond component of the regional transfer function modeland observations, and the even spread of residuals above andbelow zero confirms predictions do not suffer from bias thatcan be associated with WA-PLS regression (Fig. 5; Birks,1998). The pruned modern training sets consist of between29 and 176 samples, exceeding the minimum of 25 that isrequired to give sample-specific error terms on PMSE recon-structions (Telford and Birks, 2011).ChronologyBefore running the selected transfer function models, wefirst confirm the sedimentary couplets in the fossil recordrelate to the 1960 earthquake. Radiocarbon ages for Rı́oLingue, Chaihuı́n, Pucatrihue and Llico are reported inTable 4; for Rı́o Maullı́n see Cisternas et al. (2005) and forChucalen see Garrett et al. (2015).

We founddifferences between models at each site of between 0.05 and0.5m in reconstructed mean marsh surface elevation changeassociated with the 1960 earthquake (using WA-PLS compo-nent 2). At some sites (e.g. Rı́o Tirua, Rı́o Lingue, Pucatrihueand Rı́o Maullı́n), the variation in reconstructions betweenmodels equates to <30% of the maximum coseismic defor-mation reconstructed for that site. By contrast, at Llico thereis a difference of 0.43m between the mean reconstructionfrom the sub-regional Los Rı́os and regional scale models(70% of maximum coseismic land-level change for this site).This is probably due to the dominance of two species in thefossil record whose elevation optima are sensitive to trainingset selection (the elevation optima of Luticola mutica andPinnularia intermedia vary between 161, 227 and 240 SWLI,and 178, 257 and 262 SWLI, respectively, in the Los Rı́os,Chiloe and regional training sets).Figure 6 shows reconstructions of PMSE before and afterthe 1960 earthquake and highlights the similarity in modeloutputs at some sites (Fig. 6A–D,G) and variance at others(Fig. 6E,F). Variance is in part due to a small number ofdiatom species having inconsistent elevation signaturesacross different modern sites and therefore, depending onthe scale of the modern dataset used, differences in recon-structions can result (as described above at Llico). There arealso problems associated with some species being unique toone particular sub-region, and therefore non-analogue situa-tions arise in some models but not others, also leading tovariation in reconstructions. For example, Luticola muticaand Tryblionella debilis constitute 13–30 and 7–13% ofpre- and post-earthquake fossil assemblages, respectively,at Llico but these species are either absent or found invery low abundances in the sub-regional Chiloe moderndataset. Likewise, Fragilaria construens var. venter isabundant in fossil samples from Pucatrihue (up to 28%),and is equally abundant in the Chiloe training set (up to35%), but constitutes <3% of any one sample in the Los Rı́ostraining set.Figure 6 confirms that no model scale systematicallyproduces higher or lower PMSEs, and also emphasizes thateven where we see similarity in reconstructions between allscales, the models differ significantly when we assess thenumber of ‘good’ and ‘close’ modern analogues they provide.While local-scale models produce reconstructions withsmaller error terms (45–64% of the difference betweenMHHW and MSL) than regional models (70–76%), theyperform significantly worse when assessed using the MAT(Table 5). Regional models consistently provide the greatestnumber of ‘good’ modern analogues to fossil samples, withlocal scale models providing the fewest (Table 5; Fig. 6). Wesee an improvement in dissimilarity values with increasingspatial scale (Fig. 7). Figures 7A and B show the reduction inminDC values when using the regional or sub-regionaltraining sets compared to limiting the training set to sampleslocal to the core site only. Figure 7C shows the furtheradvantage of using regional over sub-regional models.Furthermore, variations in reconstructions at Chucalenbetween the two models both considered local (Table 5)highlight how local modern training sets should be used withcaution. Chucalen is situated approximately equidistantbetween Quilo and Estero Guillingo, and both would beconsidered as local to the fossil core site (<3 km). However,if we relied upon local samples from only one of these sites,we could assume very different amounts of coseismicdeformation occurred, due to differences in species found atboth modern marshes as well as variations in elevationoptima of principal diatom species between the sites. Eunotiapaludosa and Pinnularia appendiculata together comprise68–81% of pre-1960 diatom assemblages, and dominate thehigh marsh zone in the contemporary environment at EsteroGuillingo, but are found in very low abundances (<5% totaldiatom valves counted) in only six modern samples fromQuilo (Fig. 2). Consequently, elevation optima of these twospecies vary considerably between modern sites (e.g. by 85SWLI units in the case of Pinnularia appendiculata betweenQuilo and Estero Guillingo), and cause significant variation inPMSE reconstructions. Furthermore, Fig. 4B highlights thesensitivity of species elevation optima to local site selection,which will cause inter-site variations in reconstructions.Elevation optima are far more consistent between both sub-regional and regional modern training sets (Fig. 4B). Ofparticular note at Chucalen is the influence of Naviculacincta on reconstructions, which constitutes up to 20% ofpost-earthquake diatom assemblages, and is seen to have awidely variable elevation optimum in different moderntraining sets. Figure 3 also confirms the inter-site differencesbetween Estero Guillingo and Quilo, with the top-right clusterof Chiloe samples clearly forming two sub-groups, withdifferent assemblages from similar elevations.Table 4.

When weanalyse the similarity between fossil samples and their mostsimilar modern samples, we see that for sites where we havesamples from the local area in the regional modern trainingset, these provide most of the ten closest modern analogues(Fig. 8). In addition, at fossil sites where we have localmodern samples, we see fossil samples have fewer ‘good’ or‘close’ modern analogues when we exclude these localsamples from the regional model. This is particularly apparentat Chaihuı́n, where the full regional training set provides allfossil samples with at least ‘close’ modern analogues;conversely, no fossil samples have even ‘close’ modernanalogues if local samples are excluded from the regionaltraining set (Table 5). This is a function of the unique speciesassemblages present at Chaihuı́n in modern samples fromelevations above 240 SWLI (left-hand cluster in Fig. 3), whichalso dominate the fossil assemblages. In particular, keyspecies (up to 30%) in fossil assemblages Rhopalodia gibber-ula and Eunotia praerupta are found in significantly higherabundances above 240 SWLI at Chaihuı́n than anywhere else(up to 34 and 10% of the modern assemblage, respectively,compared to <7 and 2%, respectively, elsewhere). Thisemphasizes that while regional models are best, they shouldinclude samples from the local area wherever possible.Do Chilean tidal marshes underestimate coseismicdeformation?To assess the performance of models from different spatialscales, we compare our PMSE reconstructions with observa-tions made 8 years after the earthquake of changes in pre-Figure 5.

No model scalesystematically agrees best with observations, and as numeri-cal evaluation of models favours using regional-scalemodern data, we focus here on comparing observationswith reconstructions from the regional model (Fig. 9). Ourtransfer function produces reconstructions that fit withobservations within errors at seven of the eight sites. Itperforms worst at two sites where there are no modernsamples local to the fossil site included in the moderntraining set (Pucatrihue and Llico), for which there are threepossible explanations. Firstly, the regional modern trainingset provides no fossil sample at either site with a ‘good’modern analogue, and only provides ‘close’ modern ana-logues at Llico (Table 5; Fig. 6E,F). However, as the transferfunction does well at similar sites with no local modernsamples within the Bı́o Bı́o region (Fig. 6A,B), this suggeststhat diatom species distributions may be similar betweenthe Bı́o Bı́o, Araucanı́a and Los Rı́os regions and that somespecies may be unique to the Los Lagos region (e.g.Pinnularia obscura). Alternatively, the presence of the acid-tolerant diatom P. obscura in fossil assemblages from Llicomay indicate a unique pre-earthquake boggy environment,dominated by Sphagnum moss, which typically producesFigure 6.

Quaternary Sci., Vol. 32(3) 396–415 (2017)408 JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCEorganic acids (DeNicola, 2000), that is not captured inour modern sampling. Finally, it appears the dominance oftwo key diatom species account in part for the transferfunction predicting less coseismic land-level change at Llicothan observations suggest occurred. Denticula subtilis andNitzschia fruticosa together comprise 14–22% of post-earthquake fossil diatom assemblages at Llico, and ourinvestigation of diatom elevation optima in the modernenvironment shows that WA-PLS component 2 significantlymanipulates (increases) the optima of these species(Fig. 4A). As these species are only found post-earthquake,they would have the effect of increasing post-earthquakePMSE reconstructions, and therefore reducing the overallreconstructed coseismic land-level change.The only other site where either D. subtilis or N. fruticosaare found in significant abundances in fossil assemblages is atFigure 7.

D. subtilis is abundant bothpre- and post-earthquake, but significantly more so pre-earthquake (up to 35% of the assemblage). This would makereconstructed pre-earthquake PMSEs abnormally high, result-ing in apparent coseismic subsidence rather than the ob-served uplift.The other site where our transfer function significantlyunderpredicts coseismic land-level change compared toobservations is Rı́o Lingue. However, the regional training setprovides all fossil samples with at least a ‘close’ modernanalogue, and provides 63% of samples with a ‘good’modern analogue; instead the discrepancy could be due toinaccuracy in the original land-level change observation atthis site, which Plafker and Savage (1970) note was made onunconsolidated sediments. Alternatively, the elevation of thefossil core site may be too low in the tidal frame given theproblems the transfer function has predicting elevationsbelow MSL (see above: ‘Transfer function development’;Fig. 5). The transfer function reconstructs a pre-earthquakePMSE of 1.2m above MSL, so if the observation of 1.6m ofsubsidence is correct, then the location would be below MSLpost-earthquake. We exclude samples with elevation optimabelow 125 SWLI (MSL¼ 100 SWLI) from the modern trainingset, which therefore prevents the transfer function predictingelevations below MSL. However, even if these sampleswere included, we see a breakdown of species–elevationrelationships in these samples, which would limit theability of the transfer function to predict low elevations. Ourreconstructions at Rı́o Lingue could also be influenced byallochthonous diatom taxa, notably Paralia sulcata andPlanothidium delicatulum var. delicatula, which account for10–15% of total valves counted in pre- and post-earthquakesamples, respectively. Due to Paralia sulcata’s long-chainedstructure, its robust valves are known to be transported bytidal currents across a marsh and deposited far inland. Thiscan therefore complicate our interpretations of the deposi-tional environment, as its ecological preference is for habitatslower in the tidal frame than it is often found (Hemphill-Haley, 1995; Sawai et al., 2004; Dura et al., 2016). Likewise,the rapheless valve of Planothidium delicatulum is suscepti-ble to transport up-marsh and may distort reconstructions in asimilar way, resulting in higher reconstructed post-earthquakePMSEs than would be expected (Sawai, 2001; Sawai et al.,2016).The influence of cosmopolitan diatom taxa could also helpto explain why the transfer function underestimates coseismicland-level change compared to Plafker and Savage’s (1970)observations (Table 5) at all sites except those in the Bı́o Bı́oregion (Rı́o Andalien, Rı́o Tirua). Several principal diatomspecies within the fossil assemblages with elevation optima inthe modern environment below 150 SWLI have very broadtolerances of over 100 SWLI units (e.g. Planothidium delicat-ulum var. delicatula, Opephora pacifica, Opephora schulzii,Pseudostaurosira perminuta, Figs. 4A and 6), and thereforehave the effect of disproportionately increasing PMSE recon-structions of low marsh environments (post-earthquake) com-pared to higher marsh environments (pre-earthquake).Nitzschia frustulum and Fragilaria construens var. venter alsohave similarly broad tolerances, and are significant drivers ofthe transfer function reconstructions at Llico and Pucatrihue,respectively.Finally, there could be a delay in sediment depositionimmediately post-earthquake, and therefore our estimates ofcoseismic subsidence may in fact include some post-seismicland uplift that has already occurred before sediment accu-mulation, resulting in underestimation of coseismic land-levelchange (Garrett et al., 2013; Dura et al., 2016). Garrett et al.(2013) found variability in sediment accumulation within the2 years following the 2010 Maule earthquake, but observedlittle or no sediment accumulation at two out of four sitesinvestigated. However, given that Plafker and Savage’s (1970)observations were made in 1968, 8 years after the earth-quake, these will also include post-seismic land-level change,and therefore any delay in post-seismic sedimentation willnot be relevant when comparing with diatom-based observa-tions. It therefore appears that the transfer function is under-estimating coseismic deformation, and the dominance ofallochthonous and cosmopolitan diatom species acrossChilean tidal marshes provides a logical explanation.Reconstructing PMSE in the absence of key dataTo broaden the application of this investigation, we alsoevaluate model performance specifically at sites where weFigure 9.

Journal of Quaternary Science Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. J. Quaternary Sci., Vol. 32(3) 396–415 (2017)410 JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCEhave no local modern diatom data or no observations ofland-level change with which to compare our reconstruc-tions. As Watcham et al. (2013) emphasized, these are thescenarios we most often face when attempting relative sea- orland-level reconstruction.At the three sites where we have a local moderntraining set, we also re-ran the regional transfer functionexcluding local samples (Rı́o Lingue, Chaihuı́n, Chucalen;Table 5). The difference between reconstructions using theregional model and regional model excluding local sam-ples is a maximum of 0.26m at Chaihuı́n, and <0.01m atRı́o Lingue and Chucalen. While excluding local samplesfrom the model provided fossil samples with fewer ‘good’or ‘close’ modern analogues than the full regional model,and we also concluded from Fig. 8 that modern trainingsets should include samples from the local area whereverpossible, the variation in reconstructions is well within theerror terms of the reconstructions. Therefore, we advocatethat while it is still possible to reconstruct PMSE in theabsence of local modern data, we must exercise cautionin doing so. Where the collection of modern samples issimply not possible due to resource constraints or arestricted range of contemporary environments, we shouldinvestigate the elevation optima of principal diatomspecies, and only have confidence in the reconstructionswhere the transfer function does not extensively manipu-late the data. In such situations, the key question iswhether sub-regional or regional modern training sets aremore appropriate. We therefore looked at sites with nolocal modern samples (Rı́o Andalien, Rı́o Tirua, Pucatri-hue, Llico and Rı́o Maullı́n), and found the closest modernanalogues to fossil samples do not necessarily come fromthe closest site, or even closest sub-region (Fig. 8). If usinga sub-regional model, logically the sub-region closest tothe fossil site would be chosen, but if we used the sub-regional model closest to the fossil sites at Llico (Chiloe)and Pucatrihue (Los Rı́os), we would lose over 70% of theclosest modern analogues. This therefore supports ourearlier interpretations that regional models are superior tosub-regional or local ones.The other key question besides what to do in the absenceof local modern data is how far back in time does any part ofthe local marsh no longer provide a modern analogue? Toaddress this we use the Chucalen fossil record that covers thelast four great earthquakes that have been inferred for the1960 region (Table 6; Fig. 10). Throughout the entire 1000-year sequence, the regional model performs best in terms ofproviding fossil samples with the best modern analogues.Even for the oldest event, dated to AD 1070–1220, theregional modern training set provides 69% of fossil sampleswith at least a ‘close’ modern analogue, and 31% with a‘good’ modern analogue. By contrast, the sub-regional Chiloemodel does not provide fossil samples with any ‘good’modern analogues for any of the four palaeoearthquakes. Wedo not observe increased variation between models or adecrease in ‘good’/‘close’ modern analogues as we go furtherback in time. For three events, we also see there aresignificant differences between the two local models (Quiloand Estero Guillingo), because of variation in both speciescomposition and elevation optima of principal species be-tween the two local modern training sets (as discussed above:‘Assessing the optimum spatial scale of the modern trainingset’). This further highlights the potential danger of basingreconstructions of coseismic deformation on local samples. Itis therefore important not only to have as many modernsamples from the local area as possible, but also not to relysolely on modern samples from the local or sub-regional areawhen reconstructing deformation beyond recent events forwhich there are observations. Likewise, it is essential tounderstand the diatom ecology and explore the potentialimpact of key species on reconstructions.ConclusionsThis paper offers advances in improving understanding of(i) modern diatom distributions in south-central Chile, in theTable 6.

We haveextensively explored transfer function model outputs, com-paring reconstructions derived from different scales of mod-ern data. We have assessed transfer function performancethrough numerical evaluation of transfer function models andusing the modern analogue technique, but as this can fail todiscriminate between acceptable and unacceptable recon-structions even when there are good modern analogues(e.g. Woodroffe, 2009), we also advocate investigating eleva-tion signatures of principal diatom species to assess thereliability of reconstructions.Figure 11 provides a summary of land-level change in1960 reconstructed using our regional diatom transfer func-tion. The general profile of vertical deformation from north tosouth agrees well with the observations of Plafker and Savage(1970), although reconstructions of coseismic subsidence areup to 90 cm less than observations. This is partly due to thedominance of allochthonous diatom species and the inabilityof the transfer function to predict elevations close to, andbelow, MSL. We also demonstrate that obtaining accuratereconstructions can be problematic when species whoseelevation optima are sensitive to WA-PLS regression makesignificant contributions to the fossil dataset. Transfer functionreconstructions from Chilean tidal marshes must therefore beviewed as minimum estimates of coseismic land-levelchange, and it is essential to investigate the elevation optimaof principal diatom species in the modern environment andhow these impact upon reconstructions.We have also made advances in reducing the error termson the reconstructions compared to previous studies by usingFigure 10. Relative sea-level change over 1000 years at Chucalen (CH11/1), showing differences in reconstructions and ‘good’ modern analoguesbetween regional, sub-regional (Chiloe), and local (Quilo) transfer function models. Elevation optima of diatom species are classified based onweighted averaging of the modern training set. minDC values are plotted relative to the threshold for a ‘good’ modern analogue (the 5thpercentile). The 95% (2s) error bars are only shown for reconstructions using the regional model to allow easier comparison between models.Earthquake horizons A, B, C and D are dated to AD 1960, 1575, 1270–1450 and 1070–1220, respectively, as detailed by Garrett et al. (2015).The minerogenic unit overlying soil C is not interpreted as being a tsunami sand sheet (Garrett et al., 2015), and therefore reconstructions areshown throughout this unit (but not shown through inferred tsunami deposits A, B and D).Copyright # 2017 The Authors. Journal of Quaternary Science Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. J. Quaternary Sci., Vol. 32(3) 396–415 (2017)412 JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCEan expanded modern training set. For those sites wherereconstructions have been previously published at Rı́oAndalien and Rı́o Tirua, we have reduced transfer functionerrors by 42 and 40%, respectively (cf. Garrett et al., 2013).At Chucalen, where the record extends beyond 1960 toinclude three earlier palaeoearthquakes, our new moderndiatom data help confirm previously published estimates ofcoseismic deformation for all four events, although fossilsamples have better modern analogues and consequentlytransfer function errors are reduced by between 28 and 40%(cf. Garrett et al., 2015). While our reconstructions aresufficiently precise to provide important constraints oncoseismic land-level change, error terms could still beconsidered high compared to tidal ranges and compared tothe magnitude of reconstructed coseismic land-level change.Consequently, we make the following recommendations forfuture research.Lessons from Chile and recommendationsWe present an expanded modern diatom data set for south-central Chile showing vertical zonation of species, particu-larly above MHHW. We model the contemporary relation-ship between species and elevation to allow us to quantifypast changes in marsh surface elevation, and investigate theeffects of using modern training sets from local, sub-regionaland regional scales on reconstructions and model perfor-mance. We conclude: Regional models are superior to local models, both interms of agreement with observations and in providingfossil samples with the closest modern analogues. Modern training sets should include samples from the localarea where possible, as local samples provided themajority of the ten closest modern analogues. In the absence of local modern samples, regional moderntraining sets should be used in preference to sub-regionalsets, as the closest modern analogues do not always comefrom the closest sub-region. Modern training sets shouldinclude samples from as broad an area as possible.Our findings that regional models out-perform sub-regional and local scale models agrees with previousstudies from North America (Nelson et al., 2008; Watchamet al., 2013; Sawai et al., 2016) and the UK (Gehrels et al.,2001; Horton and Edwards, 2005), which have alsohighlighted the need for large modern training sets thatinclude samples from the full environmental gradient.However, it does appear that our Chilean transfer functiondoes not perform as well as its regional counterpart inAlaska (Watcham et al., 2013), in terms of providing fossilsamples with as many ‘good’ modern analogues andproducing error terms that are a smaller percentage of thetidal range. The reason for the former may simply be afunction of modern training set size, as the regional Alaskantraining set consists of 255 samples, compared to 176 inthis paper. However, the latter appears to be more of agenuine problem, with diatoms not being as good atreconstructing elevations below MHHW in Chile due tomany dominant species having broad elevation tolerancesbetween 0 and 200 SWLI units (MHHW).In future, when reconstructing deformation associated withpalaeoearthquakes in Chile we should therefore (i) collectnew modern samples to further expand the regional moderntraining set, and (ii) target fossil sites higher in the tidal framewhen we expect coseismic subsidence has occurred. Thelatter should increase the likelihood of reconstructing eleva-tions where diatom distributions are more tightly defined thanthey are around present MSL, and therefore reduce theinfluence of species with broad environmental tolerances thatreduce the precision of transfer function reconstructions. Inareas where low-elevation diatom taxa are under-representedon modern marshes, or where taphonomic processes occur atlower elevations, problems of transfer function under-predic-tion may remain. The final recommendation is therefore toensure careful examination of diatom elevation optima andtolerances to highlight such instances where reconstructionscan only provide minimum estimates of land-level change.All these recommendations are also pertinent when recon-structing seismic land-level change on subduction zonecoasts worldwide.Acknowledgements.
