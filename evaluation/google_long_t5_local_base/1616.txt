ABSTRACT: 
Missed appointments are an avoidable cost and resource inefficiency which impact upon the health of the patient and treatment outcomes. Healthcare services are increasingly utilizing reminder systems to manage these negative effects. This study explores the effectiveness of reminder systems for promoting attendance, cancellations and rescheduling of appointments across all healthcare settings and for particular patient groups and the contextual factors which indicate that reminders are being employed sub-optimally. We used three inter-related reviews of quantitative and qualitative evidence. Firstly, using pre-existing models and theories, we developed a conceptual framework to inform our understanding of the Contexts and Mechanisms which influence reminder effectiveness. Secondly, we performed a review following Centre for Reviews & Dissemination (CRD) guidelines to investigate the effectiveness of different methods of reminding patients to attend health service appointments. Finally, to supplement the effectiveness information, we completed a review informed by realist principles to identify factors likely to influence non-attendance behaviors and the effectiveness of reminders. We found consistent evidence that all types of reminder systems are effective at improving appointment attendance across a range of health care settings and patient populations. Reminder systems may also increase cancellation and rescheduling of unwanted appointments. “Reminders plus”, which provide additional information beyond the reminder function, may be more effective than simple reminders at reducing non-attendance at appointments in particular circumstances. We identified six areas of inefficiency which indicate that reminder systems are being used sub-optimally. Unless otherwise indicated, all patients should receive a reminder to facilitate attendance at their healthcare appointment. The choice of reminder system should be tailored to the individual service. To optimize appointment and reminder systems, healthcare services need supportive administrative processes to enhance attendance, cancellation, rescheduling and re-allocation of appointments to other patients.

  plus”, which provides additional information beyond the reminder function may be more effective than simple reminders (ie, date, time, place) at reducing non-attendance at appointments in particular circumstances. We identified six areas of inefficiency which indicate that reminder systems are being used sub-optimally. Unless otherwise indicated, all patients should receive a reminder to facilitate attendance at their health care appointment. The choice of reminder system should be tailored to the individual service. To optimize appointment and reminder systems, health care services need supportive administrative processes to enhance attendance, cancellation, rescheduling, and re-allocation of appointments to other patients.Keywords: attendance, cancellation, rescheduling, TURNUPIntroductionMissed health care appointments are a major source of avoidable inefficiency that impacts on patient health and treatment outcomes. Data on non-attendance vary, however studies from around the world consistently report non-attendance rates of between 15% and 30% in outpatient health clinics.1–4 In England, more than 12 million appointments at consultant led clinics,5 and a similar number of general practice appointments are missed each year.6 The cost of missed appointments to the UK National Health Service (NHS) has tripled since 1999.7 In 2009, non-attendance was estimated to cost over £600 million (around US$970 million).8Correspondence: Sionnadh Mairi McLeanCollegiate Campus, Sheffield Hallam University, 38 Collegiate Crescent, Sheffield, S10 2BP, UKTel +44 114 225 2271email s.mclean@shu.ac.uk Journal name: Patient Preference and AdherenceArticle Designation: ReviewYear: 2016Volume: 10Running head verso: McLean et alRunning head recto: Effectiveness and optimization of appointment remindersDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PPA.S93046Patient Preference and Adherence 2016:10submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress480McLean et alThe consequences of non-attendance include increased appointment waiting times,9 increased costs of care delivery,10,11 underutilization of equipment and personnel,10 reduced appointment availability,6,11 reduced patient satisfaction,12,13 and negative relationships between patients and staff.6,9 Missed appointments may delay presentation at health services, result-ing in a lack of follow-up of chronic conditions which may ultimately lead to complications, unnecessary suffering, and costly hospital admission.10,14 Pressures from referring agents to manage waiting lists, can potentially increase staff stress, anxiety, and fatigue levels.15 Reducing the number of missed appointments may be a relatively inexpensive way to increase health care efficiency, effectiveness, and quality.Numerous reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of existing reminder systems in varied service settings. However, research to-date focusses on the use of reminder systems in particular service contexts or technologies,16–18 rather than synthesizing knowledge across different contexts and patient groups. This study explores the effectiveness of reminder systems for promoting attendance, cancellations, and rescheduling of appointments across all health care set-tings and for particular patient groups and the contextual factors which indicate that reminders are being employed sub-optimally.Material and methodsOur project incorporated three components: the development of a conceptual framework to provide an understanding of the contexts and mechanisms which influence reminder effectiveness (review 1); a systematic review (SR) of the reminder effectiveness literature (review 2), and an evi-dence synthesis informed by realist principles to explain the contexts and mechanisms which influence reminder effectiveness (review 3). We used realist inquiry because it clarifies the context–mechanism–outcome relationships in an attempt to understand better what works, for whom, under what circumstances.19 Further detail on the methodology employed is available in the TURNUP project report.20Searches were conducted on 13 databases with date limits of January 1, 2000 to February 15, 2012: AMED, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Cochrane Library, Embase, HMIC, IEEE Xplore, Kings Fund Library Catalogue, Maternity and Infant Care, MEDLINE, PEDro, PsycINFO, SportDiscus, and Web of Science. The strategy used the concept of (reminders/prompts/alerts) in proximity to (appointments) (Figure 1). Where supported, appropriate database headings/thesaurus terms were used. The refer-ence lists of included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and SRs were screened for additional relevant studies and citation (forward-) searches were performed in respect of the included RCTs. English-language studies of various quantitative and qualitative designs were included if they investigated the effectiveness of outpatient appointment reminders, appointment attendance behavior, or explicated theories/models/frameworks relating to reminder systems or appointment attendance. Studies were excluded if they investigated reminders sent to a patient inviting them to schedule an appointment. All members of the project team were involved in screening and selection of studies and data extraction from included studies.Review 1We could find few pre-existing conceptual models or frameworks that directly explain the mechanisms by which CitationsS1 (MH “Reminder Systems”) 2,850S2 TI reminder* OR AB reminder* 8,104S3 TI appointment* OR AB appointment* 18,257S4 (MH “Appointments and Schedules”) 10,007S5 s3 OR s4 25,901S6 s5 AND s1 409S7 s1 OR s2 9,797S8 s7 AND s4 452S9 s6 OR s8 543S10 TI remind* n5 appointment* OR AB remind* n5 appointment* 277S11 TI prompt* n5 appointment* OR AB prompt* n5 appointment* 34S12 TI alert* n5 appointment* OR AB alert* n5 appointment* 6S13 S10 OR S11 OR S12 316S14 S9 OR S13 limiters – published date from: 20000101- 470Figure 1 example search strategy.Note: example search strategy: CiNAHL Plus with Fulltext, MeDLiNe, SportDiscus (via eBSCO) 2000 to January 11, 2012.Patient Preference and Adherence 2016:10 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress481effectiveness and optimization of appointment remindersreminder systems support appointment attendance. We therefore drew on a variety of models that have been developed to understand behavior in relation to medical adherence. Included models related to use of reminders to promote clinical outcomes;21 health care utilization theory;22 the theory of planned behavior;23 the trans-theoretical model;24 self-determination theory;25 protection motivation theory;26 rationale choice theory;27 and complexity theory.28 Our conceptual framework was developed through an itera-tive process involving examination of the various theories and discussions about context, mechanisms, and outcomes that were important to explain how reminder systems work to promote attendance, for whom, and in what circumstances. The framework consisted of six broad factors that could potentially influence the effectiveness of the reminder or whether patients would attend, cancel or reschedule their appointment, namely: the reminder-patient interaction, reminder accessibility, health care settings, wider social factors, cancellation and rebooking systems, and patient attributes. This framework was then used to support data extraction.Review 2Our SR of effectiveness investigated the impact of reminder systems on improvements in attendance, cancellations, and rescheduling of appointments. The questions addressed in this were: 1) how effective are reminder systems at reducing non-attendance at appointments and increasing cancellation/rescheduling of appointments? and 2) which types of reminder systems are most effective in improving the uptake of health service appointments? We used standardized methods to select, quality assess, extract and synthesize the findings of SRs and RCTs.29 The Critical Appraisal Skills Program appraisal tool for RCTs was used to quality assess those RCTs not already assessed in pre-existing SRs.30 The quality of the included SRs was assessed against the criteria used by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination when evaluating reviews for inclusion in the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects.31 We used these quality assessments to moderate our interpreta-tion of the review findings, not to exclude the papers.32Review 3Our evidence synthesis aimed to explore the differential effectiveness of reminder systems for particular population sub-groups; to identify contexts and mechanisms which influence the effectiveness of different reminder systems for particular population sub-groups; and identify any disadvantages which should be considered when introducing reminder systems for specific populations. The data extrac-tion framework used the six elements of the conceptual framework. In accordance with realist principles, not all potentially relevant papers identified from the screening con-tributed to the synthesis.33 All RCTs investigating reminder systems and all reviews (systematic and otherwise) about reminder systems and appointment systems were prioritized for full extraction of contextual and explanatory variables. Whereas RCTs were required to meet minimum quality standards in order to be included in the effectiveness SR, the studies excluded from this SR still had the potential to contribute to the evidence synthesis informed by realist principles. In many cases findings from such studies con-tributed to the evidence base regarding the mechanisms and contexts that shape the operation of reminder systems in real world settings. Examination of the trial evidence was fol-lowed by exploration of qualitative, mixed-methods and non-RCT quantitative studies about reminders and appointments for Europe, America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Thematic analysis was used to examine the evidence avail-able for each section of the framework. Subsequently a narrative synthesis was developed that sought to explain the context and mechanisms influencing how reminders support attendance, cancellation, and rebooking.ResultsThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flowchart (Figure 2) shows the numbers of included papers for review 2 and 3. Prelimi-nary database searches yielded 638 unique papers; a further 139 were identified from subsequent searches. Following the screening stages, 466 potentially relevant papers were identified. Eleven SRs met the inclusion criteria for review 2 (Table 1).16–18,34–41 These SRs either examined a single tech-nology, eg, an SR of short message service (SMS) reminder systems,17 or explored the role of information technologies along a patient care pathway, one of which might be appoint-ment reminder systems.41 The quality of included reviews was variable (Table 2). The five Cochrane reviews had been scrutinized against the highest quality standards.16,18,34,36,40 Four reviews passed the Centre for Reviews and Dissemina-tion SR quality threshold.17,35,39,41 Two reviews did not pass the minimum standard for SRs.37,38Of the 31 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria for review2,4,42–72 only ten were uniquely identified by our review. The included RCTs related to the use of systems to remind patients to attend a health-related appointment that had already been scheduled (Table 3).

Sequence generation for randomization considered adequate (although randomization method unclear in one study) but in two studies it was not clear whether, and how, allocation was concealed. Lack of blinding in all studies can be partly explained by interactive nature of text message interventions, which does not permit blinding of participants or health care providers. Potential bias from apparent lack of blinding of outcome assessors.included 4 RCTs involving 3,547 participants. Three studies with moderate quality evidence showed that mobile text message reminders improved rate of attendance compared to no reminders (RR 1.10 [95% Ci] 1.03 to 1.17).One low quality study reported that mobile text message reminders with postal reminders, compared to postal reminders, improved rate of attendance at health care appointments (RR 1.10 [95% Ci 1.02 to 1.19]). However, two studies of moderate quality showed that mobile phone text message reminders and phone call reminders had a similar impact on health care attendance (RR 0.99 [95% Ci] 0.95 to 1.03).Costs/attendance of SMS lower compared to phone reminders. No studies reported harms or adverse effects of the intervention, nor health outcomes or user perception of safety related to the intervention.Further research should focus on older patients, given that this population has, on average, more health care appointments and uses mobile phones less frequently than the younger population.Free et al35To quantify effectiveness of mobile technology based interventions delivered to health care providers or to support health care services, on any health or health care service outcome.Identified as meeting CRD criteria.

No difference in attendance using SMS reminders vs other reminders (RR 0.98, 95% Ci 0.94–1.02, respectively).

All but one of the RCTs were associated with improved outcomes. The pooled results favored appointment reminder systems for follow-up of patients (odds ratio of being lost to follow-up 0.4, 95% Ci 0.3 to 0.5).Guy et al17To assess the effectiveness of SMS reminders at increasing the uptake of appointments in health care settings.Although gray literature was searched, it was still possible that some evaluations were not identified, particularly those with a negative outcome. Unable to assess possibility of effect according to clinical reasons for attending, as few papers presented this information. Clinical presentation could affect priority placed by patients on the need for keeping an appointment.To maximize value of future evaluations, studies should collect and report information on clinical reason for attendance as well as the visit status (new, follow-up).Summary effect from RCTs was 1.48 (95% Ci: 1.23–1.72). No significant sub-group differences by clinic type (primary care clinics, hospital outpatient clinics) or message timing (24, 48, and 72+ hours before scheduled appointment).SMS reminders substantially increase likelihood of attending clinic appointments. SMS reminders appear to be simple and efficient option for health services to improve service delivery, as well as bringing health benefits for patients who receive the reminders.No significant sub-group differences by target age group (pediatric, adult, older). Age classification based on median age of patient receiving SMS reminders, or specification of clinic type as pediatric.RCTs demonstrated SMS reminders effective in wide age range from pediatric to older. Mobile usage data demonstrate that over 90% of population in many countries own mobile phones, but uptake is higher in younger people.86 As younger patients have higher non-attendance rates at clinical services,100 SMS reminders may be more beneficial in this group. However, older patients have considerably more health appointments each year, often at outpatient clinics where non-attendance costs UK NHS estimated £790 million per year.101Hasvold and wootton371) what is the best estimate of effect of sending reminders on non-attendance rates?2) Are there any differences in non-attendance when using reminders sent manually (ie, from phones operated by a human) or automatically (ie, by SMS text messages or by automated voice recordings)?3) Does time at which the reminder is sent influence the effect on non- attendance rates?4) What are costs and benefits of using reminders?Not classed as systematic review by DARe (CRD). PubMed only searched.weighted mean relative change in non-attendance was 34% of baseline non-attendance rate.Automated reminders less effective than manual phone calls (29% vs 39% of baseline value).No difference in non-attendance rate, whether reminder sent day before or week before.Cost and savings not measured formally, but almost half included cost estimates. Average cost of using either SMS, automated phone calls or phone calls was 0.41 euros per reminder.All studies except one102 showed positive effect from using reminders. (Patients themselves chose in advance whether they wished to receive reminder or not – potential bias in intervention group.) Overall no-show rate (outpatients in vascular laboratory) was 12% (average 7.6 missed appointments/week: gross annual revenue loss of US$89,107 based on ultrasound costs). Of 8,766 patients offered automated reminders, only 53% agreed to receive calls. No-show rate significantly greater for patients choosing automated reminders (8.9% vs 5.9%, P,0.0001).Patient Preference and Adherence 2016:10 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress485effectiveness and optimization of appointment remindersHenderson38To assess the effectiveness of appointment reminders as a means of increasing attendance and reducing DNA rates at new outpatient appointments.Not classed as systematic review by DARe (CRD).

Analysis based on simple weighted average for each approach (telephone, text, post, or open access). Influence of other relevant factors on non-attendance not explored. Authors acknowledge that only more recent studies (electronic rather than paper reminders) likely to be relevant now.Potential publication bias notwithstanding, authors conclude that most included interventions modestly improved attendance. Appears reliable, but did not investigate factors that might influence effectiveness of these interventions in different populations and settings. Different reminders not compared with each other. Conclusion that telephone reminders were better than text and post reminders may not be reliable. No formal evaluation of cost-effectiveness, so conclusion on relative cost-effectiveness of interventions also may not be reliable.Telephone, mail, and text/SMS interventions all improved attendance modestly but at varying costs. Text messaging most cost-effective of the three, but its applicability may be limited.

Seven RCTs examined personalized telephone calls and 9/31 studies examined postal (letter/postcard) reminders. In most studies the comparator was no intervention. The principal func-tions of the various reminder systems were reminder only, reminder requiring confirmation, reminder plus orientation or reminder plus supporting clinical information. A variety of attendance related outcomes were measured. These included attendance, cancellation, rescheduling, and patient satisfac-tion. A judgement of the quality of the uniquely identified RCTs is shown in Table 4.Reminders increase attendance at appointmentsThere was consistent evidence that reminder systems improve appointment attendance across a range of health care settings and patient population sub-groups. Only one of the 31 RCTs did not show a significant reduction in non-attendance.48 “Simple reminders”, which provide details of date, time, and location of appointments, were most frequently investigated. “Reminder plus”, which provides additional information (eg, orientation information, health information, etc) over and above date, time, and location of the appointment, was less commonly investigated. Both were effective at reducing non-attendance.There was consistent, strong evidence from SRs16,34,35,37,41 and RCTs32,65 that simple reminders are effective at increasing attendance at appointments compared with no reminder. In SRs, the pooled effects of simple reminders on appointment attendance vs no reminder indicated significant increases in attendance, with relative risks ranging between 1.06–1.10.34,35 One SR reported a weighted mean relative change of 34% from the baseline non-attendance rate.37 In RCTs the differ-ence in attendance between subjects who received remind-ers and those who did not ranged from 5% in an Australian physiotherapy clinic to 44% in an Indian dental preventive care clinic.4,66 There was strong evidence from SRs16,34,35 and RCTs42,65 that there is no differential effectiveness between different reminder technologies, eg, SMS reminders, phone call reminders or other reminders.There was weak, but consistent evidence from five studies that “Reminder plus” is more effective than simple remind-ers at reducing non-attendance. Examples of “Reminder plus” interventions include SMS notification of appointment with a health promotional message or postal reminders with additional information about medical procedures and the importance of follow-up.70,72 A Cochrane Review40 of Table 4 Judgement on quality of included trials (not already covered in included reviews)StudyReview question/aimsOverall review qualityImplications for technologiesImplications for specific populationsComfort et al48To examine the effect of the provision of “tangible” engagement services during the intake period to women’s outpatient substance abuse treatment on rates of admission, retention, and service utilization.The engagement group received additional services such as transport and child care to help with the uptake and sustainability of service use.Poor quality of reporting of the study design makes it difficult to judge quality.

Six key areas which lead to sub-optimal reminder effectiveness were identified.Accuracy of patient recordsPatient contact details are frequently incorrect or out-of-date.78,79 The likelihood of inaccurate patient records corre-sponds with populations at greater risk of non-attendance,80 including less geographically stable communities such as students, young adults or socio-economically deprived groups who may frequently change address or telephone numbers.81Reminders may not be receivedSuccessful contact rates for telephone reminders are low ranging from 30% to 60% in most health care settings. Reasons for non-receipt of telephone reminders are that land-line calls are often made during business hours (9 am–5 pm), during the working week (Monday to Friday), when it is likely that patients will be out.82 In addition, non-receipt may occur because patients do not have a telephone, they do not answer the telephone or the contact number was incorrect.74,83 Most telephone reminder systems do not leave messages for reasons of confidentiality.SMS reminders are reported to have successful contact rates of 97%–99%.79,84 Successful contact is assumed when the mobile phone indicates “message sent” being received by the sender.44,59,66 However, many patients may either not receive their SMS reminder or may receive and ignore a reminder that was not intended for them due to incorrect data entry on hospital systems.77,79 Some clients may not receive their text message until after their scheduled appointment because of delays in delivery of the text or because their phones were switched off, out of battery or out of credit.85 One disadvantage of using SMS reminders alone is the dif-ferent levels of access to a mobile telephone. Mobile phone ownership declines sharply with increasing age,86,87 although the total numbers of older people with mobile phone are increasing annually.Understanding the reminderCognitive ability, literacy level, and language determine patient comprehension of reminders, irrespective of format. These are important considerations for health services serv-ing older populations, travelling communities, inner-city deprived populations, and multilingual communities. The studies included in our review did not explore these factors. Two RCTs explicitly excluded patients who did not speak the official language (English) fluently, those with dementia, or with significant cognitive impairment.68,88 Only one RCT used multilingual research assistants to make the reminder phone call.65 Reminder systems can cater for different languages.41,66Timing of remindersWe found strong evidence that the timing of reminders, between 1 and 7 days prior to the scheduled appointment, has no adverse effect on patient attendance behavior.37,89 SMS or telephone reminders are typically sent either the day before or on the day of the health care appointment.49,57,63 Sending the reminder close to the appointment means that the patient Patient Preference and Adherence 2016:10submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress494McLean et almay either not have time to act on it or they may receive the reminder after the allotted appointment time.65 Sending reminders early allows patients to re-arrange commitments, which may increase the likelihood of a patient attending, cancelling or rescheduling.54,64,67Patient does not cancel or re-schedule the appointmentThere are numerous reasons why patients fail to either cancel or reschedule their appointment. Simple reminders rarely ask patients to cancel appointments, particularly SMS reminders where space for text is limited.46,62 Some SMS reminders ask patients to call a telephone number rather than replying to the text.4,57 Patients frequently encounter problems accessing health care systems which can thwart their intention to cancel and rebook.86,90 Problems include difficulties accessing central booking lines, including the phone being engaged, having to wait a long time to speak to someone or the call being disconnected with no option to wait or leave a message.91,92 In some cases, patients were warned by others of the difficulties of accessing a central booking line, which deterred them from making contact.86 In two studies, patients who failed to attend stated that they had already phoned or written to cancel their appointment, indicating difficulties with cancellation systems or internal hospital communication prevented cancellations being passed on to the relevant clinic.81,86Lack of tailoring to high risk groupsThere was weak evidence that patient age has no impact on reminder effectiveness, suggesting reminder systems can be employed across all age groups.18 However, few studies have investigated the differential impact of reminder systems between population sub-groups. There was weak but consis-tent evidence that deprivation, minority ethnicity, substance abuse, mental health problems, and comorbidities/illness are associated with non-attendance at appointments.93,94 There was little evidence of tailoring of reminder systems to meet the needs of these groups of patients.DiscussionThis review found consistent, strong evidence that all reminder systems are effective at reducing non-attendance at appoint-ments across diverse service contexts and patient populations. There is no clear indication of differential effectiveness between different simple reminder systems. However, there is some evidence that “Reminder plus” interventions can be more effective than simple reminders. Our review of the available evidence suggests that “Reminder plus” may result in higher attendance than simple reminders for first appoint-ments and screening appointments and that for subsequent follow-up appointments simple reminders and “Reminder plus” may produce comparable increases in attendance for most patients most of the time. However, further research employing appropriate comparative designs is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.There is also strong consistent evidence that reminders can increase patient cancellation/rebooking rates, however the success may depend to some extent upon the nature and the timing of the reminder. We found only three studies investigating this area of effectiveness,54,64,67 therefore further research exploring the effectiveness of reminder systems to promote cancellation/rebooking and rescheduling of appoint-ments is warranted.Based on the findings presented in this review, the small amount of evidence that some patients find reminders intru-sive or confusing is outweighed by the benefits.95 The use of reminders appears to be both acceptable and feasible across a range of health care settings,42,65 and we therefore propose that all patients should receive a reminder and that all health care services operating outpatient appointment systems should employ reminder systems.Whilst reminder systems can increase attendance, cancel-lation, rescheduling and reallocation of appointments, this review identified six key factors which limit the efficiency of both reminder and appointment systems. Reminder systems are often employed with the objective of increasing atten-dance rates, with limited attention given to cancellation and/or rescheduling of appointments. Full attendance at appoint-ments is unlikely to be achievable; therefore appointment cancellation and rescheduling should be seen as desirable outcomes. Appointment systems can be optimized if patients cancel and reschedule unwanted appointments, allowing health care services to re-allocate the cancelled appointment to a different patient. If appointment and reminder systems are to realize their full potential this will require a whole systems approach to looking at the characteristics of cur-rent systems for attendance, cancellation, rescheduling and re-allocation of appointments to other patients. A summary of proposed strategies is outlined in Figure 3 and discussed in greater detail to follow.Optimization strategiesHealth services, particularly those serving geographically less stable communities, should have robust procedures for maintaining and updating patient records.81Patient Preference and Adherence 2016:10 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress495effectiveness and optimization of appointment remindersIn many health services it will be relevant to consider the use of both simple reminders and “Reminder plus”. Depend-ing on the nature of the information provided, “Reminder plus” may help patients to feel more confident about attend-ing their appointment, particularly for first appointments and screening appointments.56,96 Thereafter, the use of simple reminders may be sufficient for increasing attendance at follow-up appointments in most health care settings.Since the timing of appointment reminders appears to have no appreciable impact on attendance behavior when delivered up to 7 days before an appointment, we propose that reminders should be delivered early enough to allow patients to re-arrange commitments so that they can attend the appointment and receive the care that they need. Alter-natively, if unable to attend, patients will have sufficient time to cancel and reschedule their appointments and allow health services to re-allocate and rebook appointments.54,64,67 To support and enhance rescheduling it is appropriate to frame reminders to ask patients to cancel and rebook incon-venient appointments. In addition, robust structures, which are easy to navigate and which require minimal effort from the patient, are required to support cancellation. Automated methods of cancellation, eg, SMS messages or email, are perceived by many patients as easier than methods which require direct contact since they offer flexibility to cancel at a time convenient to the patient and reduce the need to provide explanations for cancellation.18,34 Following cancel-lation of appointments, rescheduling of the appointment, if it has not occurred synchronously, also needs to be easy for the patient. For example it may be sensible, in some health care settings, to have central booking lines which are open 24 hours a day.There is little evidence of tailoring of reminder systems to meet the needs of vulnerable groups of patients who are at high risk of non-attendance; this includes deprived and ethnic groups, substance abusers, and populations with co-morbidity and illness.93,94 Given the likely coincidence of higher levels of non-attendance and health need, it is in the interests of health services to monitor whether specific groups of patients are being disadvantaged by the chosen reminder systems. Simple reminders and automated reminders may be ignored, overlooked or misunderstood, particularly if patients are experiencing an increase of their health prob-lem. We therefore hypothesize that reminders with direct personal contact might be appropriate in these groups, since the flexibility of information, advice or support which can be offered may help to overcome barriers to attendance or to cancel unwanted appointments. To facilitate attendance in these groups more intensive reminder systems are advocated. Examples of this include sequential reminders which were effective at improving attendance in a Swiss AIDS clinic.65 This consisted of: first, a phone call to either landline or mobile; second, an SMS if participants do not answer the phone after three attempts and have a mobile phone; and finally a postal reminder if participants do not answer the phone, have no mobile phone or landline at all. Intensive approaches, such as “stepped reminders” and patient navi-gators have also been effective at increasing attendance at screening and immunization programs in disadvantaged and vulnerable populations and might also be effective at re-engaging similar groups of patients who have dropped out of treatment.36,97–99 Such designs, though labor intensive would reach the maximum number of participants and may increase attendance rates and simultaneously have a cost benefit.An effective reminder and cancellation system will in crease the already heavy workload of outpatient clinics.52 Clinicians frequently fill missed appointments with alternative activi-ties such as completing dictation, making telephone calls or 1) Maintain accurate patient contact details (with alternative contact routes wherever possible). 2) Select reminder technologies that are suitable for the needs of the population; possibly more than one. 3) Where appropriate use "Reminder plus" technologies to overcome common barriers to attendance. 4) Send reminder a minimum of 2–3 days in advance of the appointment. 5) Frame reminders to ask patients to cancel and reschedule unwanted appointments. 6) Employ multiple systems for cancelling appointments which suit the needs of the patients, not the needs of the service eg, automated SMS cancellation, answer-phone, email etc. 7) Have robust rescheduling procedures in place to allow easy rescheduling of appointments for patients, both within and out of normal working hours.  8)  Monitor whether any specific groups of patients are being disadvantaged by the chosen reminder systems. 9) Employ personalized or intensive reminder strategies for groups of patients at high risk of non-attendance.10) Build in administrative time for clinicians to manage tasks which were previously routinely carried out when a patient missed an appointment.Figure 3 Summary of strategies to optimize reminder systems.Abbreviation: SMS, short message service.Patient Preference and Adherence 2016:10submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.comDovepress Dovepress496McLean et alconsulting with colleagues.56 If building in processes to opti-mize cancellation and rescheduling, then health services will need also to consider the impact on staff that frequently utilize non-attendance at appointments as an opportunity to catch up on other health care related activities.Strengths and limitationsOur approach to this review, which combined an SR with an evidence synthesis informed by realist principles, has numerous strengths, including a structured search protocol requiring thorough searches of electronic databases, reference lists, and citations. As a consequence we believe that we have assembled the widest possible body of relevant knowledge which has relevance across all health care services which use appointment systems. In addition, our review informed by realist principles includes the strong embedding of our findings in the extracted data. This stems from the practical orientation of our review and facilitates the production of implications for practice. There are also limitations to our review. Generally speaking the SR method seeks to provide a precise answer to a tightly focused question. Such reviews are most useful where there is a high degree of homogeneity around the five PICOS elements, namely the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study types. A wide range of population types, intervention, compari-son, and outcomes is included within the RCTs we identified. However, use of this wider approach offers greater analytical capability in terms of understanding contextual and mecha-nistic factors that would not have been evident in a more narrowly focused review and increases confidence that the findings have relevance in a wide range of service settings.Research implicationsWe recommend future research activities in three main areas. Firstly, more studies should routinely consider the potential for differential effects of reminder systems between patient groups in order to identify any inequali-ties and remedies. Secondly, “Reminder plus” systems appear promising but there is a need for further research to understand how they influence attendance behavior. Finally, further research is required to identify strategies to “optimize” reminder systems and compare performance against current approaches.ConclusionIn the absence of clear contraindications all health services should use simple reminders or “Reminder plus” for all patients. More intensive reminder alternatives may be relevant for key groups of patients: deprived, ethnic, substance abusers, and those with comorbidities and illness.There is evidence that reminders are used sub-optimally. To optimize appointment and reminder systems, health services should tailor reminder systems and adopt supportive administrative processes to enhance attendance, cancel-lation, rescheduling, and reallocation of appointments to other patients.AcknowledgmentsThe TURNUP project was funded by the National Insti-tute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Program (project number 10/2002/49).
