ABSTRACT: 
Coping, perceived control, dysphoria, hopelessness, and self-esteem in a sample of 100 battered women were assessed. Participants reported dysphoria and low self-esteem, but not hopelessness. High perceived control over current abuse and greater use of drugs, behavioral disengagement, denial, and self-blame as coping mechanisms were associated with increased dysphoria and low self-esteem. High expectations for control over future abuse were associated with decreased dysphoria and hopelessness and increased self-esteem. After controlling for the effects of abuse severity and low self-esteem, self-blame was a unique contributor to dysphoria and high expectations for control of future abuse were unique contributors to hopelessness. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for clinical intervention with battered women.

Domestic violence continues to be a daunting prob- lem for our nation. In 1998, women were the victims of 1.5 million violent crimes committed by a partner or ex-partner (National Institute of Justice [NIJ], 1998). Victimization rates are reported to be three times higher in women separated from their husbands than those divorced and 25 times higher in single women than in married (Bureau of Justice Statistics [BJS], 1995). As many as one in three women report violence in their relationship within any given year with low income women being more likely to be abused (American Psy- chological Association [APA], 1996). Researchers have reported even higher rates of abuse in clinical popula- tions of women (Herman, 1986; Jacobson & Richardson, 1987). 1The University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina. 2To whom correspondence should be addressed at Department of Psychology, The University of North Carolina at Wilmington, 601 South College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403. e-mail: clementsc@uncwil.edu. In addition to physical mortality and morbidity, an important consequence of domestic abuse is increased re- porting of psychological symptoms, particularly depres- sion and low self-esteem (Gleason, 1993; Housekamp & Foy, 1991; Scott-Glibaet al., 1995). Clinically sig- nificant levels of depression with accompanying suici- dal ideation and suicide attempts are commonly found among abused women (Bergman & Brismar, 1991; Sato & Heiby, 1992). These findings are important because re- search shows that the presence of depressive symptomol- ogy play a significant role in the maintenance of abusive relationships (Follingstadet al., 1991; Gelles & Harrop, 1989). Higher levels of depression and lowered self- esteem loss have been associated with the experience of more severe abuse and with the perpetuation of abusive relationships (Cascardi & O’Leary, 1992; Walker, 1984, 1989). Two variables that seem particularly important in whether a woman develops depressive symptoms follow- ing abuse are degree of effective coping (Claerhoutet al., 1982; Finn, 1985; Launius & Jensen, 1987) and degree of perceived control over abuse (Cantoset al., 1993; Miller & Porter, 1983; Overholser & Moll, 1990). In this study, cop- ing, perceived control, dysphoria, and hopelessness were assessed in a sample of 100 battered women in order to further our understanding of depressive reactions to abuse. 25 0885-7482/04/0200-0025/0C© 2004 Plenum Publishing Corporation P1: JLS Journal of Family Violence pp1038-jofv-475694 December 26, 2003 10:28 Style file version May 30th, 2002 26 Clements, Sabourin, and Spiby We also assessed self-esteem in order to gauge the extent to which loss of self-esteem may moderate the relationship of low perceived control and ineffective coping relative to dysphoria and hopelessness. Perceived Control, Depression, and Battering Contemporary domestic violence researchers have devoted considerable effort toward investigating the re- lationship between low perceived control over abuse and depression following abuse (see reviews by Overholser & Moll, 1990; Umberson,et al., 1998). Many of these inves- tigators have applied “learned helplessness” theory in their analyses, because battering has traditionally been viewed as beyond one’s control (Abramsonet al., 1978; Seligman, 1975; Walker 1984, 1993). According to learned helpless- ness theory, people exposed to uncontrollable stressful events come to believe that important outcomes are in- dependent of individual responding. This belief is termed learned helplessness (Peterson & Seligman, 1983). Re- search has linked learned helplessness in abuse situations to depressive symptoms such as sadness, passivity, and impaired cognitive functioning (Lanius & Jensen, 1987; Sato & Heiby, 1992; Walker, 1991). The learned helplessness model of depression was re- vised in 1989 in order to clarify causal pathways posited to lead to depression and is now called hopelessness theory (Abramsonet al., 1989). According to hopelessness the- ory, individuals who develop a generalized expectation of hopelessness regarding important life outcomes are vul- nerable to a specific category of depressive disorder called hopelessness depression. The expectation of hopelessness consists of two factors: (1) the belief that important neg- ative outcomes are likely, and (2) the belief that one will be helpless in preventing negative outcomes (Abramson et al., 1989). To our knowledge, the predictions of hopelessness theory have been applied to battering situations in only one study (Clements & Sawhney, 2000). In this study, abused women in shelters who expected to control fu- ture abusive episodes reported lower levels of dyspho- ria. Perceived control over current abuse was not related to dysphoria. Clements and Sawhney (2000) concluded that perceived control over current abuse was a less im- portant determinant of dysphoria than perceived control over future abuse. These researchers theorized that higher expectations for control over future abuse might confer psychological benefits to abused women. One of the purposes of this study was to extend Clements and Sawhney’s (2000) application of hopelessness theory to battering situations. Perceived Control, Coping, Depression, and Battering Researchers examining coping in samples of abused women have generally found that battered women are less likely to engage in active and problem-focused coping be- haviors than nonbattered women (Follingstadet al., 1988). Abused women are more likely to cite factors beyond their control as solutions to problems (e.g., luck or passage of time). In comparison to nonbattered controls, battered women generate more avoidant and dependent coping re- sponses and show a greater tendency to ignore problems (Claerhoutet al., 1982; Clements & Sawhney, 2000; Finn, 1985). A controversy exists in the domestic violence litera- ture over whether or not battered women use ineffective strategies to cope with abuse. Some of this controversy is based on a more general literature showing that cop- ing strategies may differ in effectiveness depending on whether or not it is possible for an individual to control the outcome (Vitalianoet al., 1993; Winkel & Vrij, 1993). Some investigators find that problem-focused strategies confer greater psychological benefit than emotion-focused strategies in situations under individual control. Emotion- focused strategies may confer greater benefit in uncontrol- lable circumstances (Valentinert al., 1994). For example, Vitalianoet al.(1990) found that problem-focused coping resulted in decreased depression in situations perceived as controllable while emotion-focused coping resulted in increased depression. In situations perceived as uncon- trollable, emotion-focused coping resulted in decreased depression. To the extent that the experience of abuse is seen as beyond one’s control, these more general findings do not seem to generalize to the domestic violence litera- ture. The few controlled investigations of coping in do- mestic violence situations seem to indicate that the use of emotion-focused strategies (e.g., venting one’s feel- ings) is associated withincreaseddepressive symptoms (Clements & Sawhney, 2000; Mitchell & Hodson, 1983). Problem-focused coping strategies are associated with de- creased depressive symptoms. Thus emotion-focused strategies do not appear to be psychologically beneficial in coping with domestic abuse. Depression, Hopelessness, Self-Esteem Loss, and Battering Many researchers interested in domestic violence theorize that battering results in depressive reactions largely through its impact on self-esteem. Although P1: JLS Journal of Family Violence pp1038-jofv-475694 December 26, 2003 10:28 Style file version May 30th, 2002 Dysphoria and Hopelessness After Abuse 27 depression and hopelessness appear to be common reac- tions to abuse, low self-esteem is also widespread (Aguilar & Nightingale, 1994; McCauleyet al., 1995). Some in- vestigators argue that abused women begin to show de- pressive symptoms due to gradual erosion of self-esteem engendered by ongoing episodes of battering (Sackett & Saunders, 1999). If gradual erosion of self-esteem is the primary determinant of depression and hopelessness then low perceived control and ineffective coping should not be significant determinants of depression once low self- esteem is taken into account. To our knowledge, there have been no investigations of psychological variables related to depression and hopelessness following battering which control for the effects of low self-esteem. RATIONALE In this study we investigated the influence of low perceived control on dysphoria and hopelessness follow- ing battering within the theoretical framework provided by the hopelessness theory of depression. This would ex- tend Clements and Sawhney’s (2000) research to appli- cations of hopelessness theory in battering situations. We assessed the effect of specific forms of coping on dyspho- ria and hopelessness using a more comprehensive mea- sure of coping than Clements and Sawhney (2000). We examined the role of self-esteem as a moderator of the influence of low perceived control and ineffective coping on dysphoria and hopelessness. Clements and Sawhney (2000) did not assess self-esteem. We also collected more extensive demographic information in order to better char- acterize our sample of battered women (Petersonet al., 1993). Extracting determinants of dysphoria and hopeless- ness following abuse may enable earlier identification of battered women most in need of psychological interven- tion. This would allow more effective allocation of clinical resources in the acute abuse situation. It would also enable clinicians to tailor interventions targeted to specific con- tributors to negative emotional reactions following abuse. It might further serve to decrease overall rates of domes- tic violence to the extent that dysphoria and hopelessness are associated with continuing risk for abuse (Follingstad et al., 1991; Walker, 1989). We acknowledge that establishing causal relation- ships between low perceived control and ineffective cop- ing, dysphoria, and hopelessness requires the use of a prospective design. It is probable that reciprocal relation- ships exist between these variables. Because shelter sam- ples are often transient, cross-sectional designs represent one practical method of collecting this information. Lon- gitudinal studies would be necessary to gauge the extent to which low perceived control and ineffective coping in abuse situations are actually causing dysphoria and hopelessness. We use the rationale of the hopelessness theory of depression and Clements and Sawhney’s application of hopelessness theory in make the generating the following hypotheses: (1) Women who report low perceived con- trol over current abuse will report high levels of dysphoria and low self-esteem; (2) Women who report high con- trol expectations for future abusive episodes will report low levels of hopelessness and dysphoria and higher self- esteem; (3) Women who report ineffective coping with abuse (e.g., denial and self-blame) will report more dys- phoria and hopelessness and will show lower self-esteem; (4) Ineffective coping and low expectations for control over future abusive episodes will be predictors of dyspho- ria even after controlling for the effects of abuse severity and low self-esteem; (5) Ineffective coping and low ex- pectations for control over future episodes of abuse will be predictors of hopelessness even after controlling for the effects of abuse severity and low self-esteem. METHOD Participants One hundred and fourteen women seeking shelter services for domestic abuse at five different North and South Carolina shelters were asked to participate in this study. Study investigators obtained written consent prior to participation. Of the 114 women recruited during the study period, 107 agreed to participate. Seven respondents were dropped from subsequent statistical analyses because of incomplete data on both coping and control measures. Par- ticipants who were dropped from subsequent analyses did not differ statistically from those not dropped on demo- graphic characteristics, abuse severity, dysphoria, hope- lessness, or self-esteem. Women who participated in this study were in their mid-30s (M = 36.5 years;SD= 9.34). Seventy-four per- cent were Caucasian. Twenty-six percent were African American. Participants had spent an average of 5 years in the battering relationship (SD= 6.79). The modal num- ber of abusive incidents participants reported in the past year was 16 or more. The reported mean level of vio- lence as assessed by the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS; Straus, 1979) was 54 (SD= 34.24) which is compara- ble to that reported by other researchers in shelter sam- ples (Clements & Sawhney, 2000; Straus & Gelles, 1986). The mean CTS score including verbal abuse items was 66 P1: JLS Journal of Family Violence pp1038-jofv-475694 December 26, 2003 10:28 Style file version May 30th, 2002 28 Clements, Sabourin, and Spiby Table I.

(SD= 36.91). Other demographic information and abuse severity characteristics can be seen in Table I. Measures The Demographic and Abuse Severity Questionnaire (DASQ; Clements & Sawhney, 2000) The demographic and abuse severity questionnaire is a 16-item self-report inventory assessing eight demo- graphic factors (e.g., age, race, religion, employment, number of children, and independent income level) and eight abuse severity indices (e.g., number of incidents of physical violence in the past year, most severe injury sus- tained in the current relationship, and number of years of abuse in current relationship). The Conflict Tactics Scale(CTS; Straus, 1979) The CTS is a 16-item self-report measure designed to assess the degree to which couples use physical vio- lence and verbal aggression to resolve interpersonal con- flict (Straus, 1979). The frequency with which one’s part- ner engages in 16 different abusive behaviors is rated on a scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (more than 20 times). Fourteen items were added to the CTS to assess sexual abuse as well as nonphysical forms of abuse. Nonphysical forms of abuse included items such as “refused to allow you access to spiritual or psychological counseling” and “denied you access to your paycheck or other forms of money you receive.” Two overall severity of violence in- dices were obtained; one by summing frequency ratings over all 30 items and one by summing frequency ratings over the 16 physical violence items. Previous research indicates that CTS items reliably discriminate acts of violence from nonviolent interactions (Marshal, 1992; Rodenberg & Fantuzzo, 1993). The mod- ified version of the CTS has demonstrated good reliability in previous research (α = .91, split-half= .86; Clements & Sawhney, 2000) and was reliable in this study as well (α = .95). Beck Depression Inventory(BDI; Becket al.,1979) The BDI is a 21-item self-report inventory that has been used to assess dysphoria in clinical and nonclin- ical populations for over 25 years (Becket al., 1979). The suicide item (# 9) was dropped from the BDI in this study because the UNC-Wilmington Institutional Review Board would not allow us to assess suicidal ideation. The 21-item BDI is a psychometrically valid and reliable mea- sure of depressive symptoms in both psychiatric (α = .86) and nonpsychiatric samples (α = .81; Becket al., 1988). The 20-item scale used in this study was also highly re- liable (α = .89). Per Kendallet al. (1987) guidelines we use the term “dysphoric” rather than “depressed” to des- cribe women who scored above nine on the BDI. This designation was used because a clinical interview was not conducted. Hopelessness Scale(HS; Becket al.,1974) The HS is a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure individuals’ generalized negative expectan- cies about the future (Becket al., 1974). The HS has demonstrated adequate reliability in cross-sectional (α = .92) and prospective (α = .85) studies (Holden & Fekken, 1988; Younget al., 1992). The HS showed good reliabil- ity in this study as well (α = .93). Examples of HS items include “There is no use in really trying to get something I want because I probably won’t get it” and “I have great faith in the future.” Control, Attributions, and Expectations Questionnaire(CAEQ) Clements (1990) developed a modified version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire (Peterson & Seligman, 1984) to assess perceived control over current life events and expectations of control for future events. Participants P1: JLS Journal of Family Violence pp1038-jofv-475694 December 26, 2003 10:28 Style file version May 30th, 2002 Dysphoria and Hopelessness After Abuse 29 reported control beliefs for their most severe and their most recent battering incidents. Clements (1990) has demon- strated adequate reliability of the CAEQ (α = .69 for control perceptions about positive events andα = .62 for perceptions about negative events) in nonabused samples. The CAEQ has demonstrated adequate reliability in abuse samples (α = .60 for control over current abuse andα = .85 for expectations of control for future abuse; Clements & Sawhney, 2000). CAEQ items were reliable in this sam- ple as well (α = .70 for control over current abuse and α = .78 for expectations for control over future abuse). COPE(COPE-B) The COPE-B is a 28-item self-report inventory de- signed to assess the extent to which participants used 14 distinct strategies to cope with their abuse (Carver, 1997). COPE-B subscales contain strategies measured by more widely used instruments, including problem-focused ac- tivities, seeking of social support, self-blame, and avoid- ance. The COPE-B also includes strategies not measured by other instruments. These include activities such as hu- mor, turning to religion, denial, and acceptance (Carver, 1997). Participants were instructed to rate how often they used each strategy to cope with “the abuse you have ex- perienced” on a 1 (I haven’t been doing this at all) to 4 (I have been doing this a lot) Likert scale. Although the COPE-B is a relatively new measure, its’ subscales have demonstrated good reliability (α’s range from .54 fordenial to .90 for drug use; Carver, 1997). In this sample, reliabilities ranged from .07 for planning to .92 for drug use. We eliminated COPE-B subscales with reliabilities less than .60 from subsequent analyses (active and emotion-focused, planning, suppres- sion of competing activities, and acceptance). Of the re- maining nine subscales, four did not involve direct ac- tion strategies to solve the problem of abuse. These four demonstrated adequate reliability: drug use,α = .92; de- nial, α = .75; behavioral disengagement,α = .66; and self-blame,α = .64. These strategies were designated as our “ineffective coping” variables in regression analyses. Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale(ROSE) The ROSE is a 10-item self-report measure of self- esteem (Rosenberg, 1965). Participants respond on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree). The ROSE has demonstrated good reliability in a great deal of previous research (α = .88; Fleming & Courtney, 1984) and in domestic violence samples (α = .90; Mitchell & Hodson, 1983). For interpretive purposes, it should be noted that higher scores on the ROSE indicate lower self-esteem. Procedure Participants were told that the purpose of the study was to “understand how battering affects women.” They completed study questionnaires after investigators obtai- ned informed consent. Questionnaires were administered during community meetings or support group sessions by the investigators or by counselors trained by the investi- gators. All participants were fully debriefed. RESULTS DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS As can be seen in Table II, women in our sample reported moderate to severe levels of dysphoria on the BDI. This level of dysphoria is consistent with that found in previous investigations of the emotional consequences of battering (Aguilar & Nightingale, 1994; Clements & Sawhney, 2000). Women in this study did not report hope- lessness. Almost 70% scored 5 or below on the HS. This lack of hopelessness is similar to that found by Clements and Sawhney (2000) and to that seen in undergraduate nor- mative samples (Lennings, 1992). Participants reported low self-esteem at levels consistent with that seen in other domestic violence samples (Scott-Glibaet al., 1995; Tuel & Russell, 1998). Seventy-two percent of this sample reported that they “did not control their current episode of abuse.” Sixty-eight Table II.

Women who were abused before marriage showed more dysphoria and hopelessness and reported lower self-esteem. Women who experienced violence outside their relationship and whose abuse began earlier in their relationship reported more hopelessness. Women whose abuse began earlier in the relationship reported lower self-esteem and more hopelessness. Other abuse severity indices were unrelated to emotional status variables and are not shown in Table I, largestr (99)= .17, ps> .05. Control and Coping Variables As can be seen in Table III, perceived control over current abuse was unrelated to expectations for control over future abuse (r = −.15, p > .05). Participants with higher perceived control over current abuse were more likely to use denial as a coping strategy (r = .29,p < .01). All other ineffective coping strategies were unrelated to control perceptions, (largestr (94)= .18, p > .05). Hypothesis 1. We hypothesized that women who re- ported low perceived control over current abuse and low expectations of control over future abuse would show higher levels of dysphoria and lower levels of self-esteem. As can be seen in Table III, contrary to our hypothesis, high perceived control over current abuse was related to increased reports of dysphoria (r = .24, p < .05). High perceived control over current abuse was not associated with self-esteem or hopelessness. Hypothesis 2. According to Hypothesis 2, women who report high control expectations for future abusive episodes will report lower levels of hopelessness (r = −.31, p < .01) and dysphoria (r = −.30, p < .01) and higher self-esteem (r = −.25; p < .05). This hypothe- sis was supported. As can be seen in Table III, women who expected to control future abusive episodes reported less hopelessness. They also reported less dysphoria and showed higher self-esteem. Hypothesis 3. According to Hypothesis 3, women who report ineffective coping with abuse (drug use, behavioral disengagement, denial, and self-blame) will be more dys- phoric and hopeless and show lower self-esteem. As can be seen in Table III, with the exception of the nonsignif- icant association between drug use and hopelessness, in- creased use of drugs, denial, behavioral disengagement, and self-blame as coping strategies were all associated with increased dysphoria and hopelessness and lower self- esteem, smallestr (99)= .22, p < .05, between denial and hopelessness, largestr (97)= .56, p < .001, between self-blame and dysphoria.

To test Hypothesis 4 we constructed two hier- archal regression equations. Abuse before marriage was entered on the first step of both regression equations as the abuse severity variable and self-esteem was entered on the second step. On the third step of the first regres- sion equation, drug use, self-blame, denial, and behavioral disengagement coping strategies were entered as a block. Expectations for control over future abuse were entered on the third step of the second equation. BDI scores were the dependent variable for both equations. As can be seen in Table IV, in Regression 1, higher abuse severity, lower self-esteem, and greater use of in- effective coping each determined a unique proportion of the variance in reports of dysphoric symptoms. Increased use of self-blame was the only significant contributor to dysphoric symptoms in the ineffective coping composite. In Regression 2, greater abuse severity and lower self- esteem each accounted for a unique amount of the vari- ance in reports of dysphoria while control expectations did not. These two regressions suggest that, after control- ling for the effects of low self-esteem and abuse severity, self-blame but not control expectations was a unique de- terminant of dysphoric symptoms in this sample. Hypothesis 5. According to Hypothesis 5, ineffective coping and low expectations for control over future abu- sive episodes will be unique determinants of hopelessness after controlling for the effects of low self-esteem and abuse severity. To test Hypothesis 5, we constructed two hierarchal regression equations. Violence outside the pri- Table V.

Self-esteem was entered on the second step in both equa- tions. In the first equation, ineffective coping strategies were entered as a block on the third step. In the second equation, control expectations for future abusive episodes were entered on the third step. As can be seen in the first regression in Table V, high abuse severity and low self-esteem were unique de- terminants of hopelessness while greater use of ineffective coping strategies were not. In the sectond equation, high abuse severity, low self-esteem, and low perceived con- trol over future abuse were each unique determinants of increased reported hopelessness. These two regressions suggest that, after controlling for the effects of low self- esteem and abuse severity, future control expectations but not ineffective coping were unique determinants of hope- lessness in this sample. DISCUSSION We investigated the influence of perceived control and ineffective coping on dysphoria, hopelessness and self-esteem using the logic of the hopelessness theory of depression in a sample of 100 battered women. In P1: JLS Journal of Family Violence pp1038-jofv-475694 December 26, 2003 10:28 Style file version May 30th, 2002 32 Clements, Sabourin, and Spiby regression analyses we assessed the influence of perceived control and ineffective coping on dysphoria and hope- lessness controlling for the effects of abuse severity and self-esteem. Perceived Control, Dysphoria, and Self-Esteem Like other investigations of emotional well-being fol- lowing battering, participants reported moderate to se- vere levels of dysphoria and low self-esteem (Sackett & Saunders, 1999; Tuel & Russell, 1998). They reported low perceived control over current abuse but high expectations for control over future episodes of abuse. According to the logic of hopelessness theory, low perceived control over current abuse and low expectations for control over fu- ture abuse should be associated with greater risk for dys- phoria and, indeed, participants who expected to control future episodes of abuse were less dysphoric. However, high perceived control for current abuse was associated with increaseddysphoria. Participants showing high perceived control over cur- rent abuse may grow more dysphoric as they attempt to ex- ert control over an uncontrollable abusive situation. Petersonet al. (1993) have suggested that high perceived control may be maladaptive in situations which are objec- tively uncontrollable. These researchers posit that help- lessness induced passivity may help conserve energy until such a time as responses can affect outcomes. Our data support Petersonet al.’s (1993) position and indicate that high perceived control over current abuse puts abused women at greater risk for dysphoria. One possible interpretation of these data is that women who believe they control their current abuse situ- ation are more likely to blame themselves for abuse or to suffer self-esteem loss as a result of abuse (Sackett & Saun- ders, 1999). However, the pattern of our correlations and regression analyses does not support this interpretation. High perceived control over current abuse was associated with greater use of ineffective coping strategies such as denial but was not correlated with increased self-blame or low self-esteem. This suggests that the effect of high perceived control over abuse on dysphoria may be inde- pendent of the effect of self-blame on dysphoria in abused women. If high perceived control and self-blame are indeed independent contributors to dysphoria then women who show both should be at greater risk for experiencing dys- phoric symptoms following abuse. Early identification of those abused women showing high perceived control over abuse and self-blame might enable more effective inter- vention, perhaps before dysphoric symptoms begin to sig- nificantly interfere with functioning. Our data indicate that interventions designed both to reduce self-blame and per- ceived control over current abuse may be more effective than those focusing solely on one of these issues (Barnett et al., 1997; Kaneret al., 1993). It is important to note that this study did not pro- vide a complete test of the applicability of hopelessness theory to battering situations. According to hopelessness theory, individuals who develop a generalized expectation of hopelessness regarding important negative outcomes will develop hopelessness depression. The expectation of hopelessness consists of two factors, a negative outcome expectancy and a helplessness expectancy (Abramson et al., 1989). In this study, the helplessness expectancy component of the model was assessed. An examination of outcome expectancies in addition to helplessness ex- pectancies would be necessary to fully test the utility of hopelessness theory in cases of abuse. To our knowledge no investigator has assessed both types of expectations in a sample of abused women. It might also be useful to examine the effect of con- trol expectancies on other known psychological correlates of abuse. High rates of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and anxiety-related symptoms have been shown in samples of battered women (Kemp & Green, 1995; Saunders, 1994). High expectations for control over future abuse may at- tenuate anxiety-related symptoms as they seem to have at- tenuated dysphoric symptoms in this study. Alternatively, women with high perceived control over future abuse may experienceincreasedanxiety-related symptoms as they continue their efforts to control an uncontrollable situ- ation. Prospective research in this area would be espe- cially beneficial because it would enable researchers to assess whether high perceived control over future abuse is causally related to the onset of anxiety symptoms. If this is so, clinical interventions addressing perceived con- trol over abuse should result in reduced anxiety-related symptoms in abused women. Our data suggest that high expectations for control over future abuse may be beneficial in terms of their asso- ciation with lower levels of dysphoria. Research is needed on correlates of high control expectations that may be less beneficial. An inexplicable but repeated finding in domestic violence research is that abused women tend to return to their abuser, sometimes more than once (see Rhodes & McKenzie, 1998 for a review). Women who expect to control future abuse may be more likely to be- lieve that they can change the outcome of future abusive episodes (Holtzworth-Monroe, 1988; Painter & Dutton, 1985). Thus high control expectations over future abuse may make return to abuser more likely (Doran, 1980; Ferraro, 1983). If this relationship is indeed established, P1: JLS Journal of Family Violence pp1038-jofv-475694 December 26, 2003 10:28 Style file version May 30th, 2002 Dysphoria and Hopelessness After Abuse 33 interventions designed to reduce expectations for control over abuse may result in decreased likelihood of return to abuser and consequent decreases in mortality and morbid- ity associated with repeated abuse. Perceived Control, Hopelessness, and Self-Esteem The lack of hopelessness found in these data is con- sistent with one previous study examining hopelessness in battered women using the HS but is inconsistent with findings in the general clinical literature (Clements & Sawhney, 2000). Studies in clinical populations commonly find that high levels of hopelessness co-occur with more severe dysphoria (Becket al.,1976, 1988). It is relatively rare to find individuals with moderate to severe levels of dysphoria who do not report hopelessness. Why would a group of battered women who report high levels of dysphoria and low self-esteem not report hopelessness? Clements and Sawhney (2000) suggested that the lack of hopelessness found in their sample of abused women might have reflected the fact that partici- pants had chosen to seek shelter services and thus expected a better future. It is likely that this occurred in our sam- ple as well. It is further probable that any shelter services participants received prior to the study contributed to the lack of hopelessness found. Prospective studies in which women are assessed at the initiation of shelter contact in addition to after receiving services are needed to assess these possibilities. The finding that high expectations for control were associated with low levels of hopelessness is consistent with hopelessness theory. Further, the fact that coping style was not a significant determinant of hopelessness supports the notion that control perceptions contribute to hopelessness in the manner specified by hopelessness the- ory. According to this theory, individuals who expect to control important life outcomes will not develop a more generalized expectation of hopelessness, or indeed, hope- lessness depression (Abramsonet al., 1989). Participants with high expectations for control over future abuse may not have believed that abuse was likely to happen to them again. This belief may have enabled them to develop a more hopeful outlook. This lack of hopelessness also implies that the high levels of dysphoria participants reported were not symp- tomatic of hopelessness depression. Future studies using measures specific to hopelessness depression would clar- ify whether battered women are showing symptoms of this disorder or of more generalized dysphoria. Prospec- tive studies are needed to establish the causal relationship between control expectations and hopelessness. Although in the short term, lack of hopelessness may be beneficial for women in this sample, it may be detri- mental in the long run. Like high control expectations, lack of hopelessness was associated with lower rates of dysphoria. However, women who are less hopeless may be more likely to believe that their relationships are sal- vageable and therefore more likely to return to the abuser. It would be important to assess the relationship between abuse specific hopelessness beliefs and likelihood of re- turn to abuser to examine this possibility. If more hopeful women are more likely to return to the abuser then clini- cal interventions may be needed to inculcate relationship specific hopelessness. Coping, Dysphoria, Hopelessness, and Self-Esteem Almost one third of our sample reported the use of ineffective coping strategies, particularly self-blame. Use of these strategies was associated with increased levels of dysphoria and hopelessness and lower levels of self- esteem. After controlling for abuse severity and low self- esteem, self-blame was the only significant contributor to dysphoria among the ineffective coping strategies. These data are consistent with a large literature finding a rela- tionship between dysphoria and self-blame among abused women (Andrews & Brewin, 1990; Barnett & Martinez, 1996; Miller & Porter, 1983). Our data support this body of literature and indicate that low self-esteem and abuse severity are not accounting for this relationship. These data indicate that reducing depression in abuse populations may involve more than improvements in self- esteem. Full remediation of depressive symptoms may not occur unless the use of self-blame as a coping strategy is reduced. They also suggest that self-blame is more dys- phoria engendering than other ineffective coping strate- gies (e.g., denial, drugs, or behavioral disengagement). Although prospective studies are needed to address this possibility, self-blame may place women at greater risk for poor emotional adjustment following abuse. If this proves to be the case, then early intervention with women who blame themselves for abuse may prevent the occurrence of dysphoric symptoms. Because this study was cross-sectional in nature, we are unable to speak to the causal nature of the relation- ships between self-blame, dysphoria, hopelessness, and low self-esteem. It may be the case that self-blame pro- duces negative affective states such as low self-esteem and hopelessness. Alternatively, as Sackett and Saunders (1999) suggest, depression, hopelessness, and self-blame may appear as self-esteem erodes. Prospective studies are needed to examine the temporal associations between P1: JLS Journal of Family Violence pp1038-jofv-475694 December 26, 2003 10:28 Style file version May 30th, 2002 34 Clements, Sabourin, and Spiby these variables. If changes in self-esteem or self-blame, for example, do indeed precede the emergence of dys- phoria and hopelessness, then early intervention targeting low self-esteem or self-blame should prevent the onset of dysphoria and hopelessness. The ineffective coping strategies shown by a large portion of this sample suggest a passive approach to the abuse situation, as do the data showing low perceived con- trol over current abuse. Passivity in the face of continuing abuse is a common finding in the abuse literature and rep- resents a dilemma for clinicians and researchers attempt- ing to intervene with abused women. Some investigators have posited that passive coping may actually serve a sur- vival function for abused women in reducing the volatil- ity of the acute battering situation (Petersonet al., 1993; Walker, 1989). It would be important to assess coping dynamically in abuse situations to determine whether or not abused women are “actively” pursuing passive coping in acute battering episodes. Data from such assessments might enable more effective early intervention in abuse situations. Limitations Our ability to generalize these findings to the di- versity of battered women is dependent on the extent to which women who access shelter services are represen- tative of all abuse victims. Participants had all made an active attempt to seek help for the abuse they had experi- enced. It would be important to assess women who have not accessed shelter services to see how they may differ on variables such as perceived control over abuse, cop- ing and emotional status from participants in this study. It would also be important to compare groups of abused women to women in distressed but nonviolent relation- ships to identify differences in perceived control, coping, and emotional status that are specific to the experience of domestic abuse. Self-report instruments may not represent the best methods of obtaining information in abuse situations. Data collection techniques aimed at increasing rapport (e g., structured interviews) may enable researchers to develop a more complete picture of individuals who experience abuse. Behavioral assessments may be of further benefit in gaining information about typical coping patterns utilized in abuse situations. The cross-sectional design of this study limits our ability to make causal inferences. Although prospective research would allow researchers to make such inferences, there are often safety issues involved with prospective re- search in abuse situations. Prior to shelter contact women are often living with their abusers. Contact with resear- chers about ongoing abuse may further endanger partici- pants. High rates of return to abuser and relocation to avoid abuser make shelter follow-up difficult. Although greater collaboration of researchers with shelters and commu- nity agencies may make some follow-up possible, cross- sectional designs might well represent the most feasible method of collecting data about abused women until such a time as research strategies can be developed to guarantee their safety. Conclusions Our data indicate that high expectations for con- trol over future abuse is associated with lower dysphoria and hopelessness. Self-blame shows a positive correla- tion with increased hopelessness and dysphoria follow- ing abuse. This implies that interventions with abused women designed to lessen dysphoria and hopelessness should address perceived control and coping. Moreover, interventions designed to enhance self-esteem may not reduce dysphoric symptoms unless perceived control and coping are also addressed. Prospective research conducted in ways that does not jeopardize participant safety is nec- essary to assess whether perceived control and coping are causally related to hopelessness, dysphoria, and low self- esteem. Prospective research examining the applicability of hopelessness theory to abuse situations might benefit from assessing outcome expectancies in addition to help- lessness expectancies, using control groups of women in distressed, nonviolent relationships. Finally, it may be ben- eficial to determine whether perceived control and coping are associated with other known psychological sequelae of abuse (e.g., PTSD).
