ABSTRACT: 
“The Legal Clinic”, as a definition, is to teach law students how they can use their abstract and theoretical information while solving juridical disputes. Although the idea of legal clinic dates back to the past, the notion of legal clinic is a recent one. It is the reason of emerging of legal clinic that law students must get in touch with practical law comprised of activities of courts and disputes among people. About legal clinic, institutions were established and books were written in developed countries. Thus, law students became skilful at carrying out what they learn at their faculties. Nevertheless, this method being valued very much at an international level is not, unfortunately, implemented in Turkey. Hence, law students in Turkey are graduated from their faculties with only theoretical information. Consequently, they cannot make use of their information when they faced with real cases and a disconnection between theory and practice shows up. Here, this study deals with activities necessary to implement legal clinic in Turkey. In this way, the law students will learn how to use their theoretical information in practice and the partway to justice will become easy and fast.

The Term of Legal Clinic A legal clinic or law clinic is a term used for defining of putting law school students’ theoretical information to practice3. In other words, legal clinics are defined in the Anglo-Saxon law that they are born as a method of practical teaching which is allowing students to actively work on real cases and involving them in legal aid projects4.A legal clinic is one of the pieces of machinery used in training students who desire to become professional.

Peer-review under responsibility of the Sakarya University 2117 Alper Uyumaz and Kemal Erdoğan / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 174 ( 2015 ) 2116 – 2122 to a large extent, in the legal field to the well-known medical clinic in the field of training for the medical profession. The legal clinic represents cooperation between the legal aid movement and the law school movement to fill certain definite needs felt by legal aid societies5. Although the idea of legal clinic is based upon the past, the notion of legal clinic is a recent one6. Putting theoretical information learned in schools of law into practice may have many different ways; such as doing internship of attorneyship, prosecution-judgeship or notaryship, virtual trials, solutions of real cases and analysis of adjudication and other else. However, this definition is a place where people get legal help commonly in international law field. These clinics are non-profit organizations and they do not get any charge7.When legal clinics were first established, they were a method for law students to get practical experience in few countries. But now, legal clinics are popular in many countries, for instances, United States, England, Germany, France, Australia, Italy, Spain, Portugal. They can make a great difference to local communities by offering pro bono services to those that cannot afford to hire a lawyer. In the meantime, legal clinic is a facility run by a law school to provide free services to the public while training their students in clinical law practice. Law students work at a legal clinic for school credit and to gain experience in handling real legal problems8. Yet, it is intended in this article that legal clinic involves not only these physical facilities but also any ways that can be used in practice. It should not be forgotten that “the law is what the lawyers are. And the law and the lawyers are what the law schools make them”9. 2. Importance and Objectives of Legal Clinic Clinic enables students to face with real life disputes and thereby offers a variety of benefits for higher education institutions. It allows students and graduates to provide a valuable experience and to demonstrate a concern with the future employment prospects10.Law Clinics enable students to put their theoretical information that they acquired through classes into practice and so to learn legal practice activities conducted under the supervision of experienced legal practitioners11. Nearly all of educational experts believe that, like medical students12, legal students may learn better when given opportunities to put their skills into practical use and may gain professional ethics13. By allowing students to meet with clients, file a case, do case research, and manage real cases, a legal clinic helps ingrain the knowledge gained in classrooms into the practice of future lawyers14. It can also be understood as a methodology15. Case analysis or the memorization of a set of rules and exceptions are teaching methods widely used in law schools. Both are useful, but cannot give enough of the picture in some subject areas to leave the student with even a general understanding. Knowledge about law is not separable from practice of law16. Students usually work under heavy supervision, and are rarely permitted to argue oral cases in court. Thanks to legal clinics, they have the opportunity to work closely with the clients throughout the span of the case, acting much as a professional lawyer would17. Clinical legal education has various objectives, some of which can be pursued at the same time 18. These objectives include: the acquisition of an understanding of the theory and practice of law in context; skills for self- learning; skills to identify choices, make decisions and implement them; law practice skills and moral education. The objectives also include the development of interpersonal skills and the provision of legal services to the poor19. The variations in the programs occur when the law school and the clinical instructor emphasize one or more of these objectives in a particular program20. 3. The Place of Legal Clinic in the Field of International Law In an increasingly globalized world, globalization has expressed not only economic but also political, cultural and social addiction. As a consequence, the demand for different law services containing more than one legal system has increased gradually. By this way, it has been expected that lawyers, wherever they live throughout the world, should solve all sort of disputes21. In a large number of countries throughout the world, legal clinic has gained a great importance for decades22 and turned into physical institutes from just being a simple methodology. The leading countries where legal clinics have gained importance are United States23, England24, Germany25, France26, Austria, Switzerland27, Australia28, Italy29, Spain30, Portugal, Denmark31 and China32. Legal clinic institutes in these countries give assistance to those that need help. Anyone may visit a legal clinic for legal aid. In most of these countries, there are different types of legal clinics which are broken down by geographical areas and legal disputes handled by students in charged in legal clinics33. The legal clinics around the world generally resemble each other34. They seek to increase their student’s capacity for practice law by applying their knowledge of legal theory in the provision of legal aid to community members. At 2118 Alper Uyumaz and Kemal Erdoğan / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 174 ( 2015 ) 2116 – 2122 all of clinics, clinicians, mostly law school students, provide pro bono legal assistance to certain indigent people in the local community. Occasionally, these clinics take part at an international level, especially about human rights, animal law, asylum-refugee law, disability rights law, intellectual property law, technology law, mediation law, criminal law, women rights and domestic violence35.Every clinic has a center for legal information, training and rights activism and gives law students the opportunity to extend the application of their legal skills into law reform, research and advocacy and to develop their public speaking skills through community legal education. The heavy local reliance on tribal and customary processes in settling disputes also provides law students with an opportunity to examine the interface between law and custom in a practical and applied sense36. The provision of pro bono legal assistance is the traditional task of legal clinics around the world and is a core function of the Clinic. Clients are offered legal advice directly by the law students who enroll in the clinical course or by volunteers under the Clinic staff's supervision. Clients are sometimes referred by the Clinic to relevant government institutions, civil society bodies, international organizations or private lawyers. Also, they have been in an extern relationship with international school of laws and institutes (United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, other international human rights organizations, various sensitive media outlets including radio stations, TV stations, newspapers and electronic media). A large number of legal clinics around the world is established under the leadership of schools of law in places which are easily accessible to target community. Certainly, legal clinics have been in an intern relationship with school of law which established them and other schools of law. 4. The Place of Legal Clinic in Turkish Law Although legal clinic has been a longstanding application in Turkey, the term of “legal clinic” is not known by even law professionals and also in literature. The reason of this situation may be that the term is unfamiliar. The legal clinic in Turkey can be reviewed in two steps; undergraduate education and post graduate education. However, pregraduate education has also importance for legal clinic. Unfortunately, pre-license education is quite inadequate due to lack of linguistic performance and education based on practice37. This insufficiency can be settled by means of instructing lessons including fundamental legal principles besides providing students with an excellent native language teaching38. The aspects of legal clinic in Turkey are undergraduate internship, after graduate internship, virtual trials, adjudication analyses 39 and visits to courts and other public authorities. As can be seen, these legal clinic applications are very inadequate so as to educate qualified law students. On the other hand, in countries which are successful in introducing legal clinics, students provide pro bono aids to community, publish their school of law journals and organize occupational symposiums in addition to above applications. Moreover, they spend more time on such activities. In Turkey, for example, the respects of legal clinic in undergraduate period are only rarely organized occupational symposiums and virtual trials. At the same time, there is not also undergraduate internship in schools of law. Moreover, legal clinic applications are not seen in all schools of law. Recently, new schools of law have established in body of nearly all of universities. In a big majority of newly established school of laws, there has not been lecturer who can give even theoretical information to students40. Therefore, on undergraduate level, the application of legal clinic is seen impossible under these conditions. However, these impossibilities cannot be a reason not to implement legal clinic41. On postgraduate education level, occupational prosecution-judgeship, attorney and notary internship are done by graduates as appearance of legal clinic. Besides, the period of these internships is differing according to the type of profession. For example, the period of internship for attorneys is one year; half of this is spent at courts and other half year is spent at private attorney offices; and prosecution-judgeship is differing from six months to two years42. By the common concept, the period of these internships, for both attorneyship and prosecution-judgeship, is not adequate for a desirable occupational sufficiency. Though, in some countries which are successful in legal clinics, students are put through an exam shortly after graduate, and then they start to do internship. At last, they are put through a second exam to start to work as professionals after many years43. In this context, it may be suggested that the period of license education should be extended to six years44; four is theoretical and two is practical45. A longstanding and sufficient period of internship supposed by proficiency tests should be spent. 5. Conclusion The establishment of European Union and quasi organizations and also the globalization of world have led 2119 Alper Uyumaz and Kemal Erdoğan / Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 174 ( 2015 ) 2116 – 2122 people to need lawyers that can give legal assistance beyond borders46. Hence, it has been expected that the legal professionals must settle controversies among people, whatever their nationality or language are, all over the world. Because the means of being a legal professional is to know practice well, the need for legal clinics has increased throughout the world. Thereby, founder elements of legal clinic have gained more importance than before. It can be said that the followings are the fundamental elements of an adequate legal clinic and education of law: x An institute of legal clinic should be established within the body of all schools of law. x A professional foreign language that can be used in international legal systems should be taught to school of law students rather than a usual foreign language. x Large classes should be minimized in schools of law. The communication of instructors with students should be increased by way of leaving education in large classes47. x For introducing legal professions to students, symposiums should be organized with the attendance of those who are known well in their professional fields. x Because of the fact that attending to the lessons increases success on exams and practice, the compulsory attendance should be set up as a rule. x Juristic discernment must be taught students of schools of law instead of teaching theoretical information48.In education of law, not only classical declaration method but also case method must be used. Lessons should be divided into theoretical and practical ones. x The habit of group work and cooperation should be gained by school of law students. Moreover, skills in collaborating with governmental and nongovernmental organizations and treating clients accordingly to legal ethics, while they are working in legal clinics49, should also be developed by students. x Law students should be faced with real cases by means of virtual trials50, pro bono legal aids and internship on undergraduate level51. x Law graduates should do an internship in private law offices, courts and public authorities (police headquarters, directorate of land registry, the register of commerce, custom houses, penal institutions, institution of forensic medicine, notary and others). At the end of this internship, graduates should be subjected to a proficiency exam. 1 See for further information about the theory, practice and clinical legal education, Martinez, G. A. (1997-1998).
