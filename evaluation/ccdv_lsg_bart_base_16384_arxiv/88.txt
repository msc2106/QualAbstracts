 Gender and Modernity inTransnational Perspective:Hugo Munsterberg and theAmerican WomanRENA SANDERSONINTRODUCTIONTN ONE OF THE FIRST and best-known collections of cultural criticism in.LAmerica, Civilization in the United States (1922), Harold Stearns beginshis chapter on "The Intellectual Life" with this widely quoted passage:When Professor Einstein roused the ire of the women'sclubs by stating that "women dominate the entire life of Amer-ica," and that "there are cities with a million population, butcities suffering from terrible poverty - the poverty of intellec-tual things," he was but repeating a criticism of our life now oldenough to be almost a clichi. Hardly any intelligent foreignerhas failed to observe and comment upon the extraordinary femi-nization of American social life, and oftenest he has coupledthis observation with a few biting remarks concerning the intel-lectual anaemia or torpor that seems to accompany it.Stearns goes on to argue that, in the case of America's feminization, "thespontaneous judgment of the perceptive foreigner is to a remarkable de-gree correct."1 By invoking the foreigner's perspective, Stearns was try-ing to impart a certain freshness to what would otherwise have been oldnews.Although Stearns was speaking of Einstein, his description of the"perceptive foreigner" applies even more fittingly to another German-Jewish intellectual, Hugo Munsterberg (1863-1916).2 Starting some twodecades prior to the publication of Civilization in the United States, Mun-sterberg surveyed many of the same phenomena treated in that anthol-ogy and anticipated many of its criticisms of American culture. In particu-lar, he played an important role in public discussions about Americanwomen and the "feminization of American culture,"3 and his place inthose discourses is my topic.285, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use286 RENA SANDERSONBorn and trained in Germany, Miinsterberg was an experimental psy-chologist who held doctorates from the universities of Leipzig (Ph.D.,1885) and Heidelberg (M.D., 1887). In 1892, he was hired by HarvardUniversity at the strong recommendation of William James, who de-scribed him as "a man of big ideas in all directions, a real genius."4Arriving in America at a time when the discourses of social study - andsocial control - were achieving formal consolidation and public respect-ability,5 he went on to enjoy a highly successful academic career. He notonly designed the program for the International Congress of Arts andScience held at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904, but he also served aspresident of both the recently formed American Psychological Associationand the American Philosophical Association, and as the chair of Har-vard's Department of Philosophy. He was "a major figure, and perhaps themajor figure, in the development of professional psychology, for it was hewho founded the field of applied psychology and gave it national promi-nence."6 In the past few years, in observance of American psychology'scentennial, there has been a spate of articles reappraising Miinsterberg'scentral role in the development of that discipline.7In addition to his academic writings, however, Miinsterberg also pub-lished, during the first decade-and-a-half of the 20th century, a virtualtorrent of social and cultural criticism. His descriptions and critiques ofAmerican life are most fully developed in five English-language books:American Traits from the Point of View of a German (1901), The Ameri-cans (1904), American Problems from the Point of View of a Psychologist(1910), American Patriotism and Other Social Studies (1913), and Psychol-ogy and Social Sanity (1914).8 With the exception of The Americans, thesebooks are collections of essays, most of which first appeared in high-circulation magazines such as Good Housekeeping, Ladies'Home Journal,McClure's Magazine, Saturday Evening Post, Atlantic Monthly, Metropoli-tan Magazine, and Popular Science Monthly.9 Though his popular writ-ings on American life were disdained by some of his academic col-leagues,10 his observations attracted substantial and respectful attentionfrom the public and from the press.Having arrived in the United States during the early stages of itsmodern transformation, a time when Americans themselves were tryingto understand and to absorb rapid social and technological change, Miin-sterberg consciously presented himself as a cultural ambassador betweentwo great world powers, and he set out to explain American life and itsvalues to Germans and to Americans. He reported on a multiplicity ofcultural phenomena and institutions that we now associate with Amer-ica's Progressive Era and with the term modernity. Some of the discoursesin which he took part were well established (for example, temperance,women's suffrage, racial and national identities and birthrates, immigra-tion, and "nervousness") and others were just forming (for example, scien-tific management, domestic science, vocational guidance, psychotherapy,mass culture, cinema, and technology)., available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of useGender and Modernity in Transnational Perspective 287I propose to examine Miinsterberg's depiction of the "modern Ameri-can woman" and to discuss it as a site where the discourses of modernity,gender, and nationality intersect. While there were other male psycholo-gists and sociologists who, starting in the late 19th century, were apply-ing their "science" to the "Woman Question,"11 Miinsterberg was one ofthe most visible. Though a few scholars have commented upon his viewsof woman's nature,12 a fuller contextualization of those views will showhim to be a significant figure for today's debates over the relationshipbetween gender and modernity.13 Whereas many of these debates havetended to focus on literary or artistic responses to modernity, on what wegenerally call "modernism," my focus on Miinsterberg will show him to beengaged in an early, moralistic kind of "pop psychology."14At the turn of the century, the empowered American woman symbol-ized the potential of a new order.15 Although this modern woman wastypically white and middle class, the emancipation she represented be-came a desired ideal for minority and working-class women, and sheevoked widespread international attention, both positive and negative.The New Woman was "quintessentially American, a type unique to theUnited States,"16 but she was exported to Europe by American writers (forexample, Henry James, Gertrude Atherton, and Edith Wharton), by jour-nalists (who spread images of Gibson Girls, college girls, career women,and crusading feminists), and by the accounts of European travelers inthe United States. Though the New Woman assumed a variety of forms,her defining quality was her emancipation. According to the French histo-rian Michelle Perrot, "On the eve of the twentieth century, the image ofthe New Woman was widespread in Europe from Vienna to London, fromMunich and Heidelberg to Brussels and Paris."17 Until the First WorldWar, both in America and abroad, the New Woman "challenged existinggender relations and the distribution of power."18 But if she initially stoodfor an improved new order (especially for women), by the 1930s she hadcome to represent primarily the threat of social disorder. The social visionshe once represented was disowned by "women and men alike" and she"had become a subject of misunderstanding and ridicule."19As this study will show, Miinsterberg's writings embody the logic andrhetoric that transformed the American woman from a symbol of progressand modernity into one of inadequacy and superficiality, thus redefiningmodernity and modernism in terms of masculine sensibility, activity, andleadership. His cultural criticism illustrates how competing gender defini-tions could be aligned with issues of race and class, and how genderedinterpretations of modernity were circulated both between new academicdisciplines and popular culture and between America and the rest of themodernizing world.It was anti-German sentiment during and after World War One thatlargely erased Miinsterberg from American cultural memory. Today heis recalled only by historians of psychology and historians of cinema.Nevertheless, his now forgotten social writings, with their Germanically, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

He receivedhis medical doctorate for work in visual perception, and the "Miinsterbergillusion" is still studied by experimental psychologists.20 Late in his ca-reer, he became interested in cinema and gained recognition as "the firstAmerican film theorist."21 His 1916 book on film, The Photoplay: A Psy-chological Study, has been called "the first systematic attempt to theorizespectatorship,"22 as well as "the most sustained of the early philosophicalexplanations and defenses of the film medium as an artform."23 And hiswritings are pervaded by metaphors based on eyesight - standpoints, ste-reoscopes, kinematoscopes, distorting spectacles.His arrival in America provided him with the opportunity - indeed,the necessity - of further pursuing his interest in perspective. After hispermanent appointment at Harvard in 1897, Miinsterberg cultivated akind of double identity, residing for the rest of his life in the United Statesbut remaining loyal to Germany and refusing to become an Americancitizen.24 Located between two nations and between two eras, he wastruly a man in the middle, and he explicitly argued that this positionallowed him privileged insights and qualified him as an unofficial cul-tural ambassador. His fluency both in English and in German enhancedhis credentials as a discerning outside (but also inside) observer of Ameri-can life, and he enjoyed broad and receptive audiences in both the UnitedStates and in Germany.Addressing his American readers, Miinsterberg consciously drew at-tention to himself as the representative of a prestigious foreign culture.During the years prior to the First World War, many American thinkers(for instance, H. L. Mencken) had a curiosity about German life andculture that Miinsterberg was happy to satisfy. His ideas about Ger-many were solicited by, among others, Willa Cather, in her capacity aseditor of McClure's Magazine. During his return visit to the fatherlandin 1910-11, she wrote him several letters, offering to buy four articleson German institutions and civilization; the magazine's publisher, SamuelS. McClure, considered German ways much superior to American waysand wanted to introduce them to the American public.25As a Harvard professor, Miinsterberg was well placed to propagate hisviews on many topics to a variety of audiences in Germany and America.He had regular, if sometimes strained, contacts with eminent colleaguessuch as William James, George Santayana, and Josiah Royce. Among hisstudents were many who went on to become influential figures them-, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Park, prima-tologist Robert M. Yerkes, psychologist Gordon Allport, and numerousother social scientists.27 His collected, unpublished correspondence, con-taining over 430 letters written by him and some 5,565 letters received byhim, reveals his astonishing energy and the remarkable range of his corre-spondents, including three U.S. Presidents (Theodore Roosevelt, WilliamHoward Taft, and Woodrow Wilson) and Franz Boas, Edward Bok, AndrewCarnegie, Hamlin Garland, and Brander Matthews. His admirers rangedfrom evangelist Billy Sunday to sexologist Havelock Ellis.28In Germany, he successfully presented himself as one of the father-land's own sons, as a representative of traditional German Kultur,29 butmost importantly as an authority on modern America. He knew andcorresponded with major German theorists of modernization, such as hiscontemporaries Georg Simmel (1858-1918) and Max Weber (1864-1920),but he had at least one advantage over them - his presence in America.30To many Europeans, the United States was precisely the place wherethe forces of modernity were most fully developed and where their effectscould be studied most clearly. Numerous German intellectuals, either hope-fully or fearfully, saw in this country not only a newly emerging rivalpower but also a model of Germany's own possible future. During the firstthree decades of the 20th century, imaginative German constructs of theUnited States, from travel writings to paintings and caricatures, became sonumerous and prominent that they acquired the collective name Amer-ikanismus.31 Indeed, a list of "only the most important" German-languageworks on America published between 1900 and 1926 fills a 300-pagebook.32The full title of Munsterberg's first book on America, American Traitsfrom the Point of View of a German (1901), highlighted that foreign view-point that he regarded as an advantage and as "the only reason whichgives, perhaps, to these small sketches a right to exist" (vii). Because thisbook was intended as constructive criticism of the United States, he prom-ised, in the interests of international harmony, not to reveal it to Germaneyes. Instead, he would write a second book, aimed exclusively at a Ger-man audience, which would present America in a more favorable light; toprevent it from dulling the criticism in American Traits, Munsterbergpromised to hide its contents from American view (xi-xii).That second book, Die Amerikaner, was published in 1903 and repre-sents Munsterberg's most lasting contribution to the discourse of Amer-ikanismus. In Germany, it went through four editions in eight years andbecame the definitive work on the topic. Prior to the 1920s, it was "themost famous portrait of the Americans produced by a German."33 Muchmore thorough and systematic than the earlier book of "sketches," thisreport on American life was received in some quarters as a report fromGermany's own future.Despite Munsterberg's promises of concealment, Die Amerikaner alsoreceived considerable positive notice on this side of the Atlantic.

Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use290 RENA SANDERSONbefore it appeared, William James praised it in terms that would havegratified the author:Miinsterberg is to publish next year in German a book on theAmericans, which will be brilliant certainly, and contain muchtrue observation.... I think Miinsterberg has by various arti-cles of his done a good deal towards helping the two nationstowards mutual understanding.34Reviewing it for the American Journal of Sociology, Albion Small hailedthe work as a "notable international event" and placed Miinsterberg inthe company of De Tocqueville and James Bryce.35 The Nation found thebook given to "preconceived theories" about America but nevertheless a"remarkable and valuable performance."36This warm reception encouraged Miinsterberg to authorize an Englishtranslation, which was performed by Edwin Holt, his assistant at Har-vard, and published in 1904 as The Americans. In defending his decisionto have Die Amerikaner translated, the author stressed the fact that hedid not do the translating: American Traits - written in English by aGerman author - derived its right to exist from the author's critical for-eign viewpoint; the second book - another person's translation of the au-thor's more flattering German original - derived its right to exist from its"reflected character" (Americans, viii). Miinsterberg drives home hispoint with a striking visual simile:The two books [American Traits and The Americans] aremeant to be like the two pictures of a stereoscope, which mustbe seen both together to get the full plastic effect of reality.(Americans, x)37Havelock Ellis praised The Americans as a "frank but appreciative studyof American institutions," and years later Henry Steele Commager sa-luted it as "the fairest and most sympathetic analysis of the Americancharacter by any German interpreter."38Miinsterberg's elaborate effort to employ various perspectives and todemonstrate his awareness of them belongs in part to the rhetoric of sci-ence: this reflexivity is meant to make his writings unique and scientificand convincing. Just as his first book on America declared itself to havebeen written from the "point of view of a German," so, a decade later, heentitled another collection of essays American Problems from the Point ofView of a Psychologist. But this effort to see things from different view-points belongs as well to the rhetoric of cultural mediation, to Miinster-berg's self-positioning between Germany and the United States. He wascareful to acknowledge validity in both countries' social systems, stressingtheir common features and predicting their eventual convergence. Hisprose is filled with balanced, antithetical constructions ("on the one hand,", available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Indeed, in hisquest for balance he comes perilously close at times to self-contradiction.Nevertheless, it must also be said that standpoint, for Miinsterberg,was largely a selling point. Whatever his assumed standpoint - as cul-tural insider or outsider, German observer or psychological scientist - henever truly questions the authoritativeness of his own position. As theone who has viewed his subject from every angle, he is "the one whoknows." His extensive discussions of perspective thus have a singlesubtext - he is an expert.39WOMAN'S ESSENCE/WOMAN'S SPHEREIt is from this authoritative stance that Miinsterberg set out to de-scribe (and thereby to control) the new mystery, the modern Americanwoman, both in herself and as a symbol of her nation. The Americanssingles out American women as "those whose self-assertion and claims toequality are the most characteristic of American life." Indeed, "many whohave studied American life would say that [American women] are thewhole story" (557). The link in Miinsterberg's mind between the newAmerican woman and new cultural conditions may be seen in this nearlyemblematic passage from the book:Woman everywhere is full of contradictions; and if the Ameri-can woman is different from all her sisters, it is because thecontradictions in her face and mien seem more modern, morecomplex and unfathomable. (559-60)40Modernity, complexity, contradiction, unfathomability - all come togetherin a physically visualized image of a woman's face: the "Americanwoman."41Before we describe in some detail Miinsterberg's pursuit of this figure,it will be helpful to state two foundational assumptions of his thought.The first is his belief that the ideal society is an organic, hierarchicalwhole. Though he declares the young American woman to be "morefavoured by fortune than either man or woman in any other part of theworld can hope to be," he poses a basic question: "Is this advantage of hersalso a gain to the family, to society, and the nation?" (Americans, 558) Ifthe answer is no, then her individual "advantage" is ultimately no advan-tage at all, for individuals cannot prosper if the nation is harmed. Miin-sterberg's ideal society was not, to his mind, a mere abstraction: Germansociety was close to achieving this ideal, and German citizens could attestto the satisfaction that comes from knowing one's duty and doing it, thepleasure and security that derive from occupying a place consistent with, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use292 RENA SANDERSONone's true inner nature, the harmonious feeling that comes from partici-pating in group ideals.42Munsterberg's first, organic, assumption leads directly to the secondidea at the heart of his thinking. To believe that each member of societyhas a natural place and a true inner nature is to embrace what we havecome to call essentialism - the idea that members of one race (or gender orsocial class or nation) have certain common physical, intellectual, andemotional traits that are not shared by members of the other races (orgenders or social classes or nations).43 Munsterberg's gender essentialismmay be seen - to choose one illustration out of many - in AmericanTraits, where he offers a "psychological formula" on whichthe observations of all times and all nations have agreed: in thefemale mind the contents of consciousness have the tendency tofuse into a unity, while they remain separated in the man'smind. Both tendencies have their merits and their defects; but,above all, they are different, and make women superior in somefunctions, and man superior in some others. (159-60)He posits woman's superiority in matters of "tact and aesthetic feeling,her instinctive insight, her enthusiasm, her sympathy, her natural wis-dom and morality." But, he says, we must beware of "her lack of clearnessand logical consistency, her tendency to hasty generalization, her mixingof principles, her undervaluation of the abstract and of the absent, herlack of deliberation, her readiness to follow her feelings and emotions."Public duties, it is clear, require "man's harder logic. If the whole nationalcivilization should receive the feminine stamp, it would become power-less" (160).This formula defining two gendered spheres of activity was, Mvinster-berg claimed, the basis of German social life, which rested on two cardinalprinciples:One of these, which sounds of course utterly commonplace, is,that it must remain the central function of the woman to bewife and mother; and the other is that public life and culture,including politics, public morality, science, art, higher educa-tion, industry, commerce, law, literature, the newspaper, andthe church, are produced, formed, and stamped by men. {Ameri-can Traits, 135)German society with its traditional gender division was in proper har-mony with nature (as revealed by psychological science). Miinsterbergcertainly did not see himself as an enemy of woman: he was, like manyother male experts at the time, speaking "for her own good."44While essentialism was clearly a cornerstone of Munsterberg's socialthought, it was in no way unique to him. On the contrary, essentialism, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of useGender and Modernity in Transnational Perspective 293dominated the thinking of most social scientists at the turn of the century.In America, essentialism maintained its hold until around 1930, by whichtime "cultural determinism had largely supplanted racial determinism asthe favored explanation among social scientists for human differences."45In Germany, essentialist thought had prevailed at least since the Enlight-enment, when there were "massive efforts to 'educate' the populace onwhat were seen as the fundamental, a priori differences between thesexes and the races."46 Miinsterberg's contemporaries in the fatherland,such as Georg Simmel and Otto Weininger, were busy turning out trea-tises on sexuality and gender relations that were invariably essentialist ifnot misogynist.47It is important to note, however, that essentialism can be put to variousand conflicting uses. Simmel, for example, saw women's nature standing inopposition to the fragmentation and depersonalization of modern life, andtherefore equated feminization with demodernization.48 Weininger, on theother hand, associated modernization with the threat of feminization. Thisexample, as Rita Felski points out, shows that the same essentialist view ofgender can give rise to "a radically divergent meta-narrative."49 Thus,while Miinsterberg declared that American women who left the domesticsphere were violating their own essence, many of these very women justi-fied themselves precisely by pointing to that essence. When single, highlyeducated, and career-minded New Women stepped out of their sphere toenter public life, they did so in the belief that they were being true to theirnature as nurturers and guardians of morality; they were only extendingthe range of their influence from the home to the broader society. Onecommentator, writing in 1912, declared,Woman has a special function in developing the welfare of hu-manity which man cannot perform. This function consists ofher power to make, of any place in which she may happen tolive, a home for all those who come there. Women must nowlearn to make their cities great community homes for all thepeople.50Attending to civic and social ills reported by muckraking journalism,individually and jointly through clubs and settlement houses, Progres-sive women set about improving the quality of life at local, state, andnational levels. Their quarrel with the likes of Miinsterberg, in short, wasover the interpretation of an agreed-upon essentialism.THE FEMINIZATION OF AMERICAN CULTURE, REVISITEDThe story of Miinsterberg's involvement in the "feminization" debatescovers roughly twenty-five eventful years, from his arrival in the United, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

As a professionalacademic, Miinsterberg had much to say about the American woman'seducation and her role in educating others.51 His rhetoric of reclamation,however, is not that of straightforward attack. On the contrary, he dis-plays his open-mindedness, describing women and their changing roles inlaudatory terms before turning to condemnation. Noting the meager edu-cational opportunities for German women in the late 19th century, hepraises the accomplishments of women students in American universitiesand in the elite women's colleges, and he sneers at those who wouldexclude women from higher education on the grounds of supposed mentalor physical incapacity (Americans, 566; American Traits, 140).52 In fact,he reminds us, in both Germany and America he had personally champi-oned the educational advancement of certain individual women in defi-ance of male traditions.53Nevertheless, it is not to be supposed that males and females haveidentical intellectual ability: women's intellectual output "is not inferiorto men's, but it is entirely different" (Americans, 585). While concedingthat women college students actually outperform the men (566), he ex-plains away their accomplishments as symptoms of the inferiority ofAmerican colleges, which put greater value on "industry, attention, andgood-will than on critical acumen or logical creativeness" (586). Coeduca-tion, a practice unknown in Germany, earned Miinsterberg's approval, atleast in its elementary and high school forms. Boys and girls who sharethe same classroom are free of immature romanticism and less subject to"regrettable one-sidedness." Employing his favorite simile, Miinsterbergwrites,Just as in a stereoscope a normal perception of depth is broughtout by the combination of two flat pictures, so here the constantcombination of the masculine and feminine points of view re-sults in a normal feeling of reality. (Americans, 562)At the college level, however, coeducation could result in eventualmarital friction. Encouraged by coeducation to see herself as equal orsuperior to her male classmates, the college woman, once married, typi-cally looked down on her husband for becoming absorbed in business andfor losing his cultural interests (American Traits, 142-3). In Germany, bycontrast, women understood that their education was inferior to that oftheir husbands (American Traits, 141-42) - presumably a desirable stateof affairs.The basic attitudes Miinsterberg expressed in his first two books on, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Though normally old-fashioned about academic matters, he sup-ported the introduction of "home economics" into the college curriculum.Ever sensitive to what he imagined were the true psychological needs ofwomen, he writes that a woman's college years are the one time in her lifewhen she might develop her "purest and finest emotions . . . her highestmental energies," and he asks,Have we a right to fill this time too with the trivial miseries ofhousehold care and turn the enthusiastic eye of the youngwoman from the Parthenon to the kitchen utensils and thesewing table? (American Patriotism, 173)54Choosing neither the Parthenon nor the kitchen utensils (as mere uten-sils), Miinsterberg constructs an argument that aestheticizes home eco-nomics and treats it as a cultural study with as much intellectual validityas any other:In short, the cup of tea at the breakfast table may to the naivemind be just tea in a cup, and that is all. To the trained mindboth the cup and the tea are the crossing points of thousandfoldinterests. (186)Colleges should not teach cooking and mending but rather the "wealth ofhistorical, sociological, biological, chemical, aesthetic and economical in-formation" that were part of a true education in domestic science (188).The chief benefit of such an education was that it would dispel "thedepressing idea that the work of the housekeeper is drudgery" (189).55What education alone could not accomplish would be achieved bytechnical means. Miinsterberg's influential book Psychology and Indus-trial Efficiency, which appeared in Germany in 1912 and in an Englishtranslation the following year, advocated the application of "scientificmanagement" to the kitchen, the pantry, and the laundry (177).56 Inother words, science, in combination with the right attitude, would leadto personal satisfaction and social harmony. At a time when feministsand socialists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman were proposing neigh-borhood kitchens and political alliances among women as a response tothe ills of domesticity, Miinsterberg, once again, was ready with a male-directed solution.Whatever his professed concern about the happiness of women them-selves, he was even more concerned about the influence that women - asteachers and as social activists - might have on others. Women's promi-nence in teaching roles was, like coeducation, a major difference betweenGermany and the United States. In this country, he writes, elementaryschooling is totally controlled by women who find the call of teaching, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

At highergrade levels, however, women teachers are a problem, because they "can-not discriminate between the superficial and the profound" (AmericanTraits, 164). It is therefore important that young males be taught by menwho will provide "manly inspiration, direction, and control" (165; cf.Americans, 584).The feminization of education, of course, was but one aspect of themuch discussed feminization of the culture at large. In The Americans,Mvinsterberg describes the spreading female influence not only in theschools, but also in the church, public welfare, social reform, the arts,nursing, and city beautification. As historians have pointed out, Progres-sive women exercised considerable power even though they did not partici-pate directly in the centers of political and economic control. Relyingprimarily on their own informal and formal networks of clubs, organiza-tions, settlement houses, and unions, women who carried out progressivework represented the interests of different classes and income levels -from the immigrants and the poor to factory workers and clerks, fromsettlement workers to housewives.57 Women were working not only toexpand their own legal and political rights, but were active as well inadvancing the causes of workers, consumers, and racial minorities.58Although Miinsterberg initially expresses admiration for women's ser-vice activity and recognizes it as representing "incontestably a powerfulin-born idealism" (Americans, 570), he nevertheless finds that this publicwork is fraught with dangers for the society as a whole. As he saw it,there were basically three ways in which women's "self-assertion" threat-ened the "American race."The first derived from the social and political direction of women'spublic activity. Like many contemporaries, he worried over the ostensiblydeclining quality of the immigrants coming to our shores. Though hesympathizes with the hardships of new arrivals from Southern and East-ern Europe, he wonders "whether, if this stream of immigration is contin-ued, it will not undermine the virility of the American people" - a "viril-ity" associated primarily with the "Germanic races" that have settledhere (163).59 Similarly, though he professes admiration for certain "distin-guished negroes" and denounces lynching and racially discriminatoryenforcement of the law, he also employs blatant racist caricatures andtalks of "negroes" as though they were not Americans at all (167-84).Politically active women conveyed to these downtrodden people un-realistic and dangerous ideas of social mobility and equality, thus chal-lenging Munsterberg's ideal of an organic society in which every race,class, and gender stayed in its proper place.The second threat posed by women's emancipation came from the rela-tive failure of educated white women to reproduce. Although Miinster-berg calls the term "race suicide" an exaggeration,60 he presents at lengthmost of the arguments made by those who feared the decline of America's"best" racial stock (Americans, 581-83): emancipated women tend to, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

What made this low rateof reproduction suicidal, of course, was the rapid rate of reproductionamong the non-Germanic peoples - the new immigrants and the "ne-groes." The "self-assertion" of the American woman made her "perhapsthe finest flower of civilization, but awakens at the same time seriousfears for the propagation of the American race" (583).The third and most far-reaching danger, however, stemmed not fromradical politics or demographics but from women's essential unsuitabilityfor public, cultural work. In Miinsterberg's view, the typical Americanwoman, uneducated but firmly opinionated, "spins a web of triviality andmisconception over the whole culture" (587). Although in Germany, the"real bulk" of cultural work was done by men who gave it "character anddirection" (American Traits, 156-57),61 American society, unfortunately,was "a government of the women, by the women, and for the women"(Americans, 571).To rectify the situation in America, Miinsterberg took aim at a widerange of targets. His 1909 article "The Intemperance of Women," whichfirst appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal, concludes that the problem ofalcoholism should not be "handed over to those who are influenced by merefeeling" but should be "left to [male] experts who would thoroughly studythe economic and social, the hygienic and psychological conditions" - onlythen could we hope for "steady progress" (American Problems, 113). Simi-larly, issues of economics were best handled not by the woman-dominatedsettlement movement but by the new science of "Economic psychotech-nics" that Miinsterberg, following the work of Frederick W. Taylor andFrank Gilbreth, proposed in his Psychology and Industrial Efficiency.62 Asa promoter of true psychological expertise, Miinsterberg crusaded againstcharlatans. His essays "My Friends, the Spiritualists" (in American Prob-lems), "Thought Transference," and "The Intellectual Underworld" (bothin Psychology and Social Sanity) expose the ignorance, vapidity, and out-right quackery of various - mostly female - usurpers: mediums, astrolo-gers, psychics, spiritualists, and faith healers.63 His 1913 essay "The Mindof the Juryman" concludes that women are more stubborn than men, lessamenable to rational discussion, and therefore unfit for jury duty (Psychol-ogy and Social Sanity, 189-98).64Among the phenomena Miinsterberg witnessed first hand was the riseof mass culture: the assembly-line production of commodities combinedwith the use of modern media for advertising, sensationalism, the manipu-lation of desire. From his first arrival in the United States, he had ex-pressed misgivings about American democracy's leveling tendencies: inDie Amerikaner, for example, he plays upon the common root of the Ger-man words for equality (GZeic/iwertigkeit) and uniformity (Gleichformig-, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use298 RENA SANDERSONkeit), declaring that democratic equality promotes uniformity and stan-dardization in everything, from fashions in hats and ties to religion andworldviews (2:253). The rise of mass culture, which created unprece-dented uniformity in objects and in persons, signaled the triumph of theworst sides of American modernity: a lack of discrimination, disrespectfor true expertise, the triumph of mediocrity - precisely the characteris-tics Miinsterberg identified with women.His essay "The Fear of Nerves," first published in 1909 in MetropolitanMagazine, was an early attempt to define the psychological features of lifein a modern society driven by fashions of the market and the media. Hailedas "splendid" by William James and praised in a New York Times edito-rial,65 the article debunked the widespread idea that the country was in thegrip of "nervousness" caused by the complexity of modern life.66 Taking a"masculine" course, Miinsterberg defends modern technology and dis-misses "neurasthenia" as merely a fashion (American Problems, 14-15).But he also finds something real that needs treatment: Americans' " weak-ness of will," "weakness of attention" (15) - a "bad habit of the nerves, butnot nervousness" (16). After presenting a long list of American characterflaws, he traces them to one cause: "the predominance of the feminine mindin the shaping of national society" (19). Women lack men's ability to concen-trate, and it is the "predominance of women" thatgives to the American life a general aspect of haste and ner-vousness, where every movement is quickly taken up andquickly forgotten, where fads and fancies are alternating withundignified rapidity, and where public discussions too oftenremain superficial and controlled by feeling. (20-21)It is noteworthy that the technologies associated with mass culture - forexample, the advertising industry and the film industry-were in thehands of men, and Miinsterberg gladly advocated applying his psychologi-cal "science" to these fields. But when he wanted to denounce their dis-turbing effects on society, he thought of feminized consumers, of women.He thus anticipated a gendered pattern that would dominate discussionsof middlebrow culture in the 1920s and beyond.67A feature of mass culture that Miinsterberg found especially troublingwas its heavy infusion with the new, more liberal, sexual morality.68 Theemergence of this increasingly vulgar America confronted Miinsterbergwith evidence that his campaign for a healthy hierarchical society wasbeing lost, but he was not one to abandon a fight. In his long 1914 essay"Sex Education," he argued against various "reformers" - challengers toproper psychological authority - who called for frank public discussion ofsexuality. Convinced that such open discussion would stimulate uncon-trolled sexual activity, thereby causing "that evil which it hopes to de-stroy" (Psychology and Social Sanity, 6),69 he nevertheless found himselffacing a paradox - to advocate a "policy of silence" he had to violate that, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The early Puritans, who were reticent about sex, had theright idea, but now that reticence was mistakenly being blamed for soci-ety's present problems: "This new age, which takes its orders from Broad-way with its cabarets and tango dances, must ridicule the silence of ourfathers and denounce it as a conspiracy" (50). Modernity, in other words,presented a challenge to patriarchy ("fathers") and its control over theflow of information ("sex education").In fact, despite its simple title, "Sex Education" covers many topicsand reveals Miinsterberg's many anxieties about modern life. Under theguise of psychological analysis, he goes in for old-fashioned moralizing,decrying a wide range of activities and trends, from coeducation (nolonger the healthy practice it once was) to staged melodramas and movieswith sexual themes, from public discussions about contraception and eu-genics and venereal disease to the unsavory realities of dance halls, fromthe causes and effects of adultery to those of prostitution.The survival of Western civilization was thus at stake, threatened bynon-Germanic "races," mass culture, hedonism, sexual excitation, sexualdisease, nervousness, women. Munsterberg"s "scientific" linking of these"threats" confirms Deborah Jacobs's view that the new social sciences,which "advanced themselves through the creation and exploitation ofneeds (markets?) for their allegedly superior abilities at making distinc-tions," ended up "conflating the less-valued terms of superior/inferiorbinaries in a huge and amorphous category where women, natives, per-verts, the poor, mass culture, and the ill bleed one into another."70THE MALE REACTIONMiinsterberg's alignment of women's emancipation with a levelingand lowering of cultural life illustrates Andreas Huyssen's well-knownclaim thatthe political, psychological, and aesthetic discourse around theturn of the century consistently and obsessively genders massculture and the masses as feminine, while high culture,whether traditional or modern, clearly remains the privilegedrealm of male activities.71Seen from a global standpoint, Miinsterberg was part of an interna-tional chorus of intellectuals who were sounding the tocsin over "thedecline of the West" (thus preserving their own status while saving "civili-zation") and who deplored the rising tide of "hyperdemocratization."72But America was already a self-professed democracy, a country wherewomen, for all of their disadvantages, enjoyed greater freedom than else-, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use300 RENA SANDERSONwhere, and where, therefore, many men were already seeking to restrictthat freedom. In the United States, that is, Miinsterberg's social writingsparticipated in a continuing discourse that began in the 19th century andprogressed through the first half of the 20th, a discourse that both warnedagainst the emasculating effects of women's cultural takeover and calledfor men to reclaim that "privileged realm of male activities."One well-known manifestation of this male reaction was the idealiza-tion of manly adventure that began in the 1890s and, by the turn of thecentury, had become a popular cult of physical virility.73 Because Ameri-can culture was believed to have been weakened by overcivilization, over-restraint, and mass standardization, there were calls for revitalizationthrough physical masculinity, male force, and the strenuous life thatcombined "martial bellicosity" with a growing enthusiasm for such sportsas boxing, football, and bicycling.74 Outdoorsmanship and fitness, the BoyScout movement, and primitivism were also promoted as part of this"return-to-masculinity" movement.In the more ethereal realm of culture, there were parallel develop-ments. Well before 1900, as American women gained power, women'svalues and their influence on society came under scrutiny by both menand women. A common explanation for the rise of women's culturalinfluence - an explanation embraced by Miinsterberg and by manyothers - was located in America's seemingly anomalous history: becausethe American continent needed to be settled, men had become absorbed inpractical matters of business and labor, and the cultural realm was there-fore taken over by women {Americans, 588).75 In fact, this quasi-historicalexplanation of a unique American identity is a cultural myth with ahistory that dates back at least to the writings of early foreign visitors,such as De Tocqueville and the Austrian Isidore Lowenstein.76Male reformers who sought to reassert masculine control over culturethus had their own manhood questioned on the principle that "culture isfeminine and cultivated men tend to be effeminate."77 Some men re-sponded to these doubts by stressing the differences between male andfemale cultural contributions. Male authors devised standards that distin-guished women's work from their own. Henry James, for example, in a1868 book review of Dallas Galbraith (a novel by Rebecca Harding Davisthat he admitted he had not read), attacked women writers, especiallybest-selling popular writers, for their "earnest," "sentimental," "didactic"work and defined the formalist aesthetics of the "objective novel" in con-trast to the school of women's writing that appeals "to the conscience, tothe sense of right and wrong, to the instincts of charity and patronage."78By thus linking the domestic, sentimental, and reformist impulses foundin writing - mostly in women's writing - James exemplifies the pointmade by Suzanne Clark that the modernistreversal against the sentimental helped to establish belea-guered avant-garde intellectuals as a discourse community,, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

The men have been feminized.81Moreover, the intellectual life of women "turns out on examination not tobe an intellectual life at all, but sociological activity" conducted by "thecountless national organizations for improving, elevating, uplifting this,that, or the other."82 True interest in "intellectual things," however, "isfirst, last, and all the time disinterested."83 True imaginative thought is"wayward and masculine" and above all "useless."84 These dicta, withtheir echoes of Matthew Arnold and Oscar Wilde, are meant as a reproachto women writers who believe that "the real test of ideas lies in theirutilitarian success,"85 and they indicate how Stearns is aligning himselfwith the newly forming high-modernist aesthetic.86Thus, Miinsterberg's writings are further significant evidence thatthere is a gender-focused dialectic at the core of modernity and ofmodernism.87 The image of woman's "nature" as emotional, idealistic,and superficial - "In the room the women come and go / Talking ofMichelangelo" - provided modernist males with the grounds for ridicul-ing concepts and social developments associated with women's emancipa-tion: social reform, progressive politics, popular culture. The argumentthat women's emancipation was endangering society discouraged womenfrom public life and opened the way for men to resume roles of leader-ship, reclaiming for male professionals the fields of education, socialscience, social work, psychology, and the civic duties that women hadthreatened to dominate. Moreover, antagonism to all forms of publicpower for women ultimately proved inseparable from opposition to theempowerment of minorities, of immigrants, and of the working class -"the masses, which follow any fashion and hysteric outcry" (Preface to1914 reprinting of The Americans, vi).88According to Miinsterberg and many others, only by restoring theproper gender balance in the realm of culture could the nation be savedfrom the threats of race suicide and social dissolution.

Moreover, contrary to explanationsthat see this transformation as a result of World War One, Miinsterberg'swork shows that the change was already occurring before the war and in atransnational manner.DEFENDING THE FATHERLANDIn the academic year 1910-11, Miinsterberg resided in Berlin as aHarvard exchange professor - in effect an outside observer again - andthis visit challenged his earlier assumptions about Germany. Upon hisreturn to the United States, he wrote a pair of essays describing thechanges he had noticed, especially in women and in gender relations.Though he praises the German woman's traditional frugality, selfless-ness, and efficiency, he also observes with ambivalence the influence ofthe American model.89 And though he notes certain healthy develop-ments, he has doubts about German women in colleges and in the work-force. Returning to his idee fixe, he wonders if this "public life work" is "inharmony with the functions of woman as a wife and mother" (137). Al-most echoing Henry James, he asserts that women's cultural contribu-tions bear the stamp of mediocrity: "All that the women have given hereas in America are some best sellers in fiction and their like in paintingand scholarship" (126).Also affecting Miinsterberg's view of Germany was his growing asso-ciation of modernity with sexual permissiveness. Whereas his 1912 es-says on Germany express ambivalence toward developments there, his"Sex Education" article of 1914 denounces Germany's moral corruption.He deplores the "wave of immorality" and the "pathetic decadence" sweep-ing through German drama and literature and affecting the behavior ofthe nation's youth.90 His homeland, which for so many years had servedhim as a superior society against which to measure America, was becom-ing modernized - Americanized.Once the Great War broke out in Europe, he became a convenienttarget for anti-German sentiment in America. Indeed, the supreme ironyof his life is that his consciously Teutonic persona - his formality in man-ner and dress, his Prussian-style mustache - ultimately worked againsthim and against Germany. His continued calls for American neutrality,even as America leaned increasingly toward support of England, led tohis public denunciation by former friends, colleagues, and supporters. Itwas quite possibly the stress of becoming a pariah in his semiadoptedcountry that led to his fatal cerebral hemorrhage at age fifty-three onDecember 16, 1916, less than four months before the United States de-clared war on his homeland., available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

As it is, one can only say nowthat he was too profoundly German to see the war and itscauses as they are seen by the Americans among whom he hadlived so long and taught so much.91By the end of World War One, Munsterberg's name was well on its wayto oblivion, both within the American academic world and in the publicarena: "By 1919, less than 3 years after his death, there was hardly anyreference to any of his more than 10 books and dozens of articles in basicand applied psychology."92 His prolific work was "obliterated, or perhapsit would be better to say dropped, from the official memory of the Ameri-can press and public."93 Although in some respects his thinking was out oftouch with the postwar world and its intellectual currents (he was, forexample, an anti-Freudian), in other ways his views were still most rele-vant. For example, of the thirty-three essays in the 1922 collection Civili-zation in the United States, at least sixteen are on topics that Miinsterbergdealt with directly in his writings. Nevertheless, he is mentioned no-where in the anthology or in its bibliographical notes (though there arefavorable references to various Harvard figures who broke with him).This omission was probably no oversight. After all, Harvard wanted toforget Miinsterberg, and editor Stearns proudly proclaimed himself a"Harvard Man." By the same token, there is no German among the threecontributors to this 1922 book who discuss "American Life from the For-eign Point of View." Our "recovery" of Munsterberg's place in the earlymodernization of America thus teaches us something about the role ofpolitical censorship within the process of historical understanding.94CONCLUSIONIt is always difficult to estimate any specific thinker's contribution toa broad discourse - which is one reason for Michel Foucault's famousshrug, "What matter who's speaking?"95 In Munsterberg's case, the diffi-culties are compounded by his active participation in many discoursesand by his postwar erasure. Nevertheless, for students of modernity he isunquestionably a significant figure. Though many of his judgments strikeus today as wrongheaded or worse, he retains his importance both as arepresentative of his time and as an influence upon it, notable both for hisideas and for the way he arrived at them., available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core. Open University Library, on 11 Feb 2017 at 06:45:46, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use304 REN A SANDERSONAs we have seen, he attacked the growing power of American womenas a violation of true female nature and a detriment to the country. Likemany other (mostly male) thinkers, he called, in the name of national andracial health, for masculine reassertion in all areas of public, cultural life.He brought to his tireless crusade the authority of a newly emergingapplied psychology and the authority of his German perspective.Despite his professed belief in the power of science to solve socialproblems and to guide the world into the new age, Miinsterberg was, likemany of his contemporaries, deeply ambivalent about modernity. Indeed,cultural historians have offered labels such as "antimodern modernism"(T. J. Jackson Lears) and "reactionary modernism" (Jeffrey Herf) to de-scribe the ambivalent reactions of a wide range of thinkers - in Americaand in Germany - to the threats and promises of the unfolding future.96Miinsterberg is thus of special interest because of his place in the middle,not simply between the old and the new but between two modernizingcultures with very different histories.If he resembled many of his contemporaries in his ambivalence aboutsocial change, he resembled them as well in his use of the Americanwoman as a vehicle for expressing that ambivalence. For him, as for manyothers alarmed by threatening social transformations, she served as anideal "Other," a figure of difference that allowed him to define his ownintellectual position on modernization and emancipation and to (re)defineat the same time his own role in a changing world.It was Miinsterberg's view that the promise of modernity could berealized only if women remained in their premodern condition. To theextent that he welcomed change, his response may have been "consistentwith New World optimism" (in the words of his principal interpreter),97but he envisioned a distinctly masculine future run by a "new culturalleadership" of "scholarly experts" (Preface to the 1914 reprinting of TheAmericans, vi). He historicized manhood by dehistoricizing womanhood.Stripping woman of her historically accrued functions, restoring her os-tensibly timeless, universal, and essential nature, he defined the contem-porary in masculine terms: man was the agent of history, whereas womanwas outside history. Simultaneously trivializing female nature (as shal-low, emotional, conformist) and appropriating female roles (the bearer ofculture, the solver of social problems), he sought to channel modern devel-opments in safe directions.As this study has suggested, Miinsterberg's rhetoric of mediation andhis near obsession with shifting perspectives may be read as characteris-tic markers of bicultural discourse. It is necessary to add, however, thathis mediatory stance contributed to the acceleration of developments hedeplored as well as those he advocated. The very paradox that he encoun-tered in calling for reticence about sex applied, in a sense, to nearly all ofhis cultural criticism: by warning against various aspects of modernityand of American life, he inevitably called attention to them, popularizedthem, and planted ideas about them into contexts over which he had no, available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

German visitors such as Wilhelmvon Polenz, Arthur Holitscher, Fritz Voechting, Annalise Schmidt, PaulRohrbach, and Adolf Halfeld all sought in various ways to understandAmerican modernity through the American woman, whose uniquenessepitomized American difference." Miinsterberg's writings on the Ameri-can woman are thus significant as part of a transnational movement to-ward masculine reassertion that affected both the direction of Americanmodernity and the Americanization of the world.NOTES1.

Except forThe Americans, virtually all of Miinsterberg's other works in English were writ-ten by Munsterberg himself or, in some cases, translated by him from his ownGerman original. Though I will cite The Americans in Holt's authorized transla-tion, I will occasionally refer to the German text, Die Amerikaner, 2 vols. (Berlin:Ernst Siegfried Mittler und Sohn, 1904). Works, by Munsterberg are cited paren-thetically in the text.9. Except as noted, all citations of Miinsterberg's articles will be to the ver-sions reprinted in these collections. Munsterberg also published numerous uncol-lected essays in such periodicals as the New York Times, Century, Current Litera-ture, Chautauquan, Outlook, Cosmopolitan, Independent, Everybody's Magazine,Reader Magazine, Science, and Scientific American Supplement.10. Some of Miinsterberg's colleagues in psychology at Harvard regarded hispopular work as pseudoscience, and they resented his quest for the limelight.Even after they themselves had turned to applied psychology, "they continued toview his studies as vulgarizations mainly because Munsterberg himself was vul-gar" (Kuklick, Rise of American Philosophy, 211).11.

I am thus aligning myself with Lisa Rado's call for modernist studies that"move in the direction of a more culturally based criticism, a more historical andinterdisciplinary approach" ("Lost and Found: Remembering Modernism, Rethink-ing Feminism," in Rereading Modernism, 12) and with Rita Felski's defense ofliterary-critical readings of sociological texts (Gender of Modernity, 35-36).15.

In the first decade of the century, Miinsterberg's intrusions into German-American relations led to rumors that he was a German spy and to a rebuke of hisactivities from Harvard's President Eliot (see Hale, Human Science, 87-105).25. Eight letters from Willa Cather to Miinsterberg are contained in theMiinsterberg Manuscript Collection at the Boston Public Library. In the end,Miinsterberg's articles on Germany appeared elsewhere (see note 89).26. Although the figure who most influenced Gertrude Stein during her Rad-cliffe years was William James, it should be remembered that Miinsterberg alsoplayed a role in her development. By her own account, Stein and a young Harvardstudent "worked out a series of experiments in automatic writing under the direc-tion of Miinsterberg"; this led to her publishing the results of her own experi-ments in the Harvard Psychological Review. The report "was the first writing ofhers ever to be printed. It is very interesting to read because the method of writingto be afterwards developed in Three Lives and Making of Americans alreadyshows itself" (The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas [New York: Random House,1933], 77-78).27. See Landy, "Hugo Miinsterberg," 794. Perhaps ironically (in view of mytopic), one of Miinsterberg's psychology students, William M. Marston, went on tocreate the comic strip figure of Wonder Woman (Hale, Human Science, 120).28. Margaret Munsterberg"s biography reprints a glowing letter from Sunday(415). In his work Sex in Relation to Society (1910), Havelock Ellis describesMiinsterberg as a "distinguished psychologist" and an "impartial and competentcritic of the American people" (Studies in the Psychology of Sex [New York: Ran-dom House, 1936], 2: 486, 459)., available at https:/www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0361233300006359Downloaded from https:/www.cambridge.org/core.

Because Miinsterberg was a Danzig-born Jew, Keller finds it "question-able whether his credentials as a German national would have been as fullyaccepted in Germany as they were in America" (States of Belonging, 114). Never-theless, the fact remains that Miinsterberg was warmly praised and decorated bythe Kaiser.30. Max Weber came to the United States, at Miinsterberg's invitation, tospeak at the Congress of Arts and Science at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904.Afterward, he traveled for three months here, and his observations affected hislater writings on capitalism and Protestantism, on bureaucracy, and on politicalorganizations (see Lewis A. Coser, Masters of Sociological Thought: Ideas in His-torical and Social Context [New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1971], 239).31. In English, the best book-length treatment of Amerikanismus is by BeekeSell Tower, Envisioning America: Prints, Drawings, and Photographs by GeorgeGrosz and his Contemporaries, 1915-1933 (Cambridge: Busch-Reisinger Mu-seum, Harvard University, 1990). See also Theresa Mayer Hammond, AmericanParadise: German Travel Literature from Duden to Kisch (Heidelberg: Carl Win-ter Universitatsverlag, 1980), and Frank Trommler's informative piece on Amer-ikanismus in the two-volume collection America and the Germans: An Assessmentof a Three-Hundred-Year History, ed. Frank Trommler and Joseph McVeigh(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985), 2: 332-42. With few ex-ceptions, such as Helmut Lethen, Neue Sachlichkeit 1924-1932: Studium zumWeifien Sozialismus (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1970), and American Paradise, neitherGerman nor American studies have given more than passing attention to theimportant role played by gender within Amerikanismus and thus within theearly-20th-century Americanization of Europe.32.

The chapter "Women" in American Traits (1901) anticipates the discus-sion of women in The Americans (1904). Both Miinsterberg's German (in DieAmerikaner) and Holt's English versions owe something to Miinsterberg's earlieraccount in English. Following Miinsterberg's dialectic, I will therefore quote fromboth books, in the hope of achieving the "full plastic effect" of his reality.38. Ellis, Studies in the Psychology, 2: 486; and Henry Steele Commager, ed.,America in Perspective: The United States through Foreign Eyes (New York: Ran-dom House, 1947), 261.39. Munsterberg"s commitment to the idea of expertise - and his recognitionof the need for what is known today as interdisciplinarity — may be seen in hisprogram for the international academic conference of 1904 (see Miinsterberg,"The Scientific Plan of the Congress," in Congress of Arts and Science, UniversalExposition, St. Louis, 1904, ed. Howard J. Rogers, 8 vols. [Boston: HoughtonMifflin, 1905-7], 1: 85-134; see also Miinsterberg's article "The St. Louis Con-gress of Arts and Sciences [sic]," Atlantic Monthly 91 [May 1903]: 671-84).

In Miinsterberg's Die Amerikaner, the passage reads: "Das Weib istwiderspruchsvoll iiberall, und wenn die Amerikanerin anders ist als alle andern,so ist sie es dadurch, dass die Widerspriiche in ihrem Antlitz moderner, ver-wickelter, unlosbarer erscheinen" (2: 261). Unlosbarer is perhaps stronger thanHolt's "unfathomable" in its suggestion of "unresolvability."41. This passage neatly illustrates the thought process analyzed by LuceIrigaray in her Speculum, de I'autre femme, the thought process that attempts (inJonathan Culler's succinct restatement of Irigaray) "to relegate the feminine to aposition of subordination and to reduce the radical Otherness of woman to aspecular relation: woman is either ignored or seen as man's opposite" (Culler,"Reading as a Woman," in On Deconstruction: Theory and Criticism After Struc-turalism [Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982], 58; see also Irigaray, Speculumof the Other Woman, trans. Gillian C. Gill [Ithaca: Cornell University Press,1985]).42. For a further discussion of Munsterberg"s organicism, see Hale (HumanScience, 56-69).43. The term essentialism and the validity of the concept(s) implied by theterm remain matters of debate. According to some writers, women's mental,moral, and personal attributes really are different from those of men, and a truefeminist position would respect these essential differences. For the best-knownexamples of this view, see Carol Gilligan, In a Different Voice: PsychologicalTheory and Women's Development (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982);and Mary Field Belenky et al., Women's Ways of Knowing: The Development ofSelf, Voice, and Mind (New York: Basic, 1986).

Quoted by Riley, Inventing the American Woman, 160.51. According to Trecker, the interest of "scientific conservatives" in women'seducation probably stemmed from education being the area in which the "feministchallenge to the old ways of thinking" had made its greatest advances ("Sex,Science and Education," 355). Views similar to Miinsterberg's were common insocial science of the time. See, for example, the chapter "Adolescent Girls andtheir Education," in G. Stanley Hall's major study, Adolescence (New York: D.Appleton, 1905), 2: 561-647.52.

In his essay "Race Decadence" (1911), Theodore Roosevelt explained thatGermany at least did not show the "decadence" of "wilful [sic] sterility" (LiteraryEssays [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1926], 187-88).60.

Guy Reynolds has recently identified in the writings of Van Wyck Brooks,H. L. Mencken, Harold Stearns, Joseph Hergesheimer, Lionel Trilling, and ErnestHemingway a gender-specific "series of oppositions" of feminine and masculinecharacteristics whose terms are "based on the terms used by American criticsduring the approximate period 1915-22" (Willa Gather in Context: Progress, Race,Empire [New York: St. Martin's, 1996], 43). Reynolds provides a table of opposi-tions that aligns the "feminine" with "neurosis," "uprootedness," the "utilitar-ian," " 'low' art," the "corruption of culture," and "gentility"; the "masculine," bycontrast, is aligned with "health," the "usable past," the "disinterested," "highart," "renewal of culture," and a "new 'earthy' writing."88.

Praise for German women appears in Munsterberg's "The New Germany,"which appeared in North American Review (February 1912) and was reprinted inAmerican Patriotism (1913) as "The Germany of To-day." Also reprinted in thatcollection is his more ambivalent essay, "The German Woman," which was firstpublished in Atlantic Monthly (April 1912).90.

Landy attributes Munsterberg's "fallfrom grace" to a variety of causes: transitions and debates within the field ofpsychology; cultural and political tensions between Germany and America; Mun-sterberg's personal arrogance and vanity; Munsterberg's untimely death (794-96).93.

Hale, Human Science, 8. Contrasting Munsterberg's views with those ofmore pessimistic German social theorists, such as Friedrich Tonnies, GeorgSimmel, and Max Weber, Hale traces Munsterberg's "optimism" to his philosophi-cal synthesis in which "principles of efficiency and scientific management did notdestroy the natural order but allowed its fruition" (8) - principles that Miinster-berg, in my view, clearly associated with male control.98. Just as a warning can be taken as praise, the converse is also true. Accord-ing to Beck, the American traits that Miinsterberg praised in Die Amerikaner(self-direction, self-realization, self-perfection, self-assertion) were taken up bycritical postwar German writers who restated them "in such exaggerated termsthat the positive connotations were virtually lost" (.Germany Rediscovers Amer-ica, 234).99.
