INTRODUCTIONThe physical configurations of an active noise control(ANC) system are very important as they determine theupper limit of the performance the system can achieve. Toachieve global sound power reduction, secondary sourcesshould be close to the primary source, for example, withinhalf the wavelength from the primary source in the freefield.1 Another important step in designing the physical partof an ANC system is to find the best positions for errormicrophones and a proper cost function for minimization.To actively reduce the radiated sound power, micro-phones should provide an error signal that is proportionalto the total radiated sound power. According to ISO 3744,the sound power level can be measured with 20 micro-phones on a hemisphere in a semi-anechoic chamber, andthe radius of the test sphere should be equal to or greaterthan each of these three sizes: (1) twice the largest sourcedimension; (2) a quarter of the wavelength of interest; and(3) 1 m. Therefore, it is not practical for use in ANC sys-tems, especially at low frequencies or when the noisesource is large.2 Another way to measure the total soundpower is to use sound intensities measured in the near fieldof the noise sources, but Berry et al. found that the strat-egy of minimizing the near-field sound intensity suffersfrom two main limitations due to the fact that sound inten-sity is a signed quantity.3In cases where control of total sound power is difficultor unnecessary, control of sound radiated into specified areasoffers an alternative. A commonly used error sensing strat-egy for local control is to minimize the sound pressurewithin a local area.4 Julliard et al. applied error sensors inthe far field from an inlet fan and yielded up to 15 dB attenu-ation in a large angular range in the radial extension of thesensor location.5 Rafaely investigated the potential use of aspherical loudspeaker array for local active control of soundand created a larger quiet zone compared to a monopolesource with the error microphones within the local areawhere noise reduction is required.6 All of the above errorsensing strategies can create a local quiet zone; however,they cannot guarantee noise reduction in the far field.Qiu and Zhao proposed to use the sum of the squaredsound pressures at several points within an angle as the costfunction and achieved directivity control from the near tothe far field, but some of the error points are far from theprimary source.7 For the compactness and stability of ANCsystems, error microphones should be located in the nearfield of the primary and secondary sources. This paper willinvestigate a near-field error sensing strategy that canachieve directivity control in both the near and far fields.The motivation for investigating this method arises from anindustry project, where the noise radiated from a haulingtruck to a direction where a community locates is requiredto be reduced.8The challenge of near-field error sensing is to find anappropriate cost function and the best positions for errormicrophones. For the active control of free field radiation,the optimal positions for error microphones are where thenoise reduction is the greatest when the strengths of second-ary sources are optimized by minimizing the total radiateda)Electronic mail: wangsp822105@126.com598 J.

Zanderand Hansen investigated several error sensing strategies,including the minimization of pressure at a point, the totalreal acoustic power output, an estimate of the acousticpotential energy, and a new error sensing strategy based onminimization of the power flow determined by a modaldecomposition of the duct sound field and found that thebest strategy is minimizing the downstream power flow.11Qiu et al. compared eight different cost functions for near-field error sensing of a monopole and dipole primary sourceand found that the most appropriate strategy is minimizingthe sum of the weighted mean active intensity in a directionnormal to the surface surrounding all the primary and con-trol sources.12Another near-field error sensing strategy is the virtualerror sensor arrangement, where physical error microphonesare located near the primary source to estimate the soundpressure at virtual error sensor locations far from it and cre-ate a quiet zone there,13 but it can only achieve local control.Berkhoff showed the effectiveness of applying virtual errorsensors on an active noise barrier with numerical simula-tions.14 Fuller et al. applied the virtual error sensor technol-ogy on a portable generator set and achieved overallreductions of between 0.5 and 4.6 dBA at virtual error sensorlocations; however, because of the inaccuracy of the model-ing of transfer functions, it is lower than the noise reductionat physical sensors (3.5–11 dBA).15 Peterson et al. investi-gated the virtual error sensing in a rigid-walled acoustic ductand found that theoretically it is possible to obtain infinitereductions at virtual locations and this can be extended tocreate a moving quiet zone, but the noise reduction willdecrease for high excitation frequencies and larger virtualdistances.16,17 Petersen et al. proposed a virtual sensing algo-rithm for local active noise control systems using Kalmanfiltering theory and demonstrated its effectiveness by imple-menting the algorithm on an acoustic duct arrangement.18 Aproblem with the virtual error sensor arrangement is that itrequires preliminary identification of the system.In this paper, a new near-field error sensing strategy isproposed for active directivity control of radiated sound. Byimplementing an array of near-field microphones in a planeclose to the primary source, sound radiation in the desireddirection is reduced in both the near and far fields. Therequirements on the error microphone array are investigatedwith numerical simulations. The feasibility of the proposedmethod is demonstrated with experiments in an anechoicchamber. In practical applications, the error microphonescan be located on a plane perpendicular to the directionwhere noise reduction is required, and by summing up thesignals at all the microphones as one error signal, only a sin-gle channel active controller is needed, resulting in the lowcomplexity and cost of the system.II. THEORYA schematic diagram of the near-field error microphonearray is illustrated in Fig. 1. The array is located in front ofthe primary source on the z¼ z0 plane with evenly distrib-uted error microphones, and noise reduction is requiredin the direction defined by the unit vector n (sin h cos u,sin h cos u, cos h), where h and u are shown in Fig. 1.Based on the spatial Fourier transform, the amplitude ofthe sound in wavenumber domain can be expressed as anintegral over the z¼ z0 plane19Pðkx; ky; z0Þ ¼ð11ð11pðx; y; z0Þejðkxxþkyyþkzz0Þdxdy;(1)wherekx2 þ ky2 þ kz2 ¼ k2; (2)k¼ c/2pf is the wavenumber; c is the sound speed in the air;f is the frequency of interest; p(x, y, z0) is the sound pressureat any point (x, y, z0) in the z¼ z0 plane; and kx, ky, and kz arethe components of the wavenumber in x, y, and z directions,respectively. Noise reduction in the direction of n isrequired, so kx, ky, and kz can be calculated withkx ¼ k sin h cos u;ky ¼ k sin h sin u;kz ¼ k cos h; (3)where h 2 (p/2, p/2) and u 2 [0, 2p). The amplitude ofsound radiation in this direction can be calculated with Eqs.(1) and (3).The sum of the weighted sound pressures at severalsampling points in the z¼ z0 plane is used to approximatethe integral in Eq. (1). The squared amplitude of the sum ofthe sound pressures at L error points evenly distributed onthe z¼ z0 plane multiplied by a weighting factor is definedas the cost functionJ ¼XLi¼1pðxi; yi; z0ÞWðxi; yi; z0Þ2; (4)FIG. 1.

Ifthere are sufficiently many points on the plane, P(kx, ky, z0)will be minimized if J is minimized. In the experiments, n isdirected perpendicular to the microphone array and eachweighting factor W is unity. The cost function Eq. (4) can besimplified as the squared amplitude of the sum of the soundpressures at all the microphones.In Eq.

InEq. (9), I is a LL matrix where all the elements are 1.According to the spatial Fourier transform, P(kx, ky,z0) represents the amplitude of the sound propagationthrough the z¼ z0 plane along the (kx, ky, kz) direction, sothe noise reduction can be guaranteed in this directionfrom the near to the far field if Eq. (4) is minimized,which is different from traditional local control. The ideaused here is similar to that in planar near-field acousticalholography, where the wave field is measured on a planarsurface to reconstruct the three-dimensional field.17 To thebest of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time thespatial Fourier transform is applied in ANC for directivitycontrol of sound radiation. For effective control perfor-mance, the suitable geometric configurations of the size ofthe microphone array, the microphone spacing and the dis-tance between the array and the primary source are investi-gated in this paper. This sensing strategy improves thecompactness of the ANC system and reduces the complex-ity and cost of the system. Because all the error signalsare summed before feeding into an active controller, itreduces the requirements of the active controller from mul-tiple error channels to a single error channel, and increasesthe convergence speed of the adaptive system.III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONSAs shown in Fig. 1, the size of the primary source in thesimulations is LxLyLz m, which is simulated by 216monopoles evenly distributed within this volume, emittingsound energy at the same frequency but with random ampli-tudes and phases. The primary source is located within thecuboid from (0, 0, 0) to (Lx, Ly, Lz). A single secondarysource is at (h, Lyþ r, s). The near-field error microphonearray is on the z¼ z0 plane, which is parallel to the primarysource. The size of the microphone array is LW m. Thedistance between the array and the primary source is d,which is equal to z0. The vector n represents the directionwhere noise reduction is required.

Soc. Am. 144 (2), August 2018 Wang et al.A. Directivity controlThe frequency of interest is 340 Hz and the wavelengthk is 1 m. The size of the primary source is set asLx¼Ly¼ Lz¼ 1 m. The secondary source is k/10 away fromthe primary source (r¼ 0.0886 m, s¼ 0.0500 m). The pri-mary sound pressure level (SPL) distribution in the evalua-tion plane is shown in Fig. 2(a). An array of 13 13 errormicrophones are evenly distributed on the plane ofL¼W¼ 3 m at d¼ 0.4 m in front of the primary source, andEq. (9) is used to optimize qs.The distributions of the SPL with control are shown inFigs. 2(b) and 2(c). In Fig. 2(b), h¼ 0, u¼ 90, and a quietzone with more than 10 dB noise reduction is created directlyin front of the error microphone array from the near to thefar field. For h¼ 30 and u¼ 90, the SPL with control isshown in Fig. 2(c). It is obvious that the error microphonearray successfully creates a quiet zone in the target directionas well, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposederror sensing strategy to achieve directivity control.B. Effects of the error microphone spacingFigure 3 shows the noise reduction (NR) when there are4 4, 7 7, and 10 10 error microphones on a 3 m 3 mplane which is located 0.4 m in front of the primary source.The desired noise reduction direction is perpendicular to theerror microphone plane, so h¼ 0, u¼ 90. It can be seenthat the system does not function until the distance betweentwo neighboring microphones is reduced to 0.5 m, whichcorresponds to 7 7 error microphones, as shown in Fig.3(b). This indicates that there is a constraint on the micro-phone spacing.FIG. 2.

Acoust. Soc.

Table Ilists the spacing requirements for effective active control withthe error microphone array parallel to the primary sourceplane and d¼ 0.4 m. The maximum allowed distance betweenneighboring microphones is 0.5 m for 340 Hz and 0.25 m for680 Hz, and it remains the same for different sizes of themicrophone array, so it can be deduced that the maximumallowed microphone spacing is approximately half the wave-length of the frequency of interest in this case, which is simi-lar to the rules in near-field acoustical holography (NAH).20C. Effects of the size of the near-field errormicrophone arrayFigure 5 shows the NR in the evaluation plane when thesize of the primary source is 1 m 1 m 1 m. h and u are 0and 90, respectively. The distance between neighboringerror microphones is fixed at k/4, which satisfies the require-ments mentioned above (less than k/2). The minimum sizeof the error microphone array is 2 m, which is approximatelytwice the size of the primary source. This is consistent withthe discussions in ISO 3744, where the measurement radiusof the hemisphere is required to be equal to or greater thantwice the characteristic source dimension for the determina-tion of the sound power of the noise source.2The NRs for h¼ 60 and u¼ 90 with different arraysizes are shown in Fig. 6. The size of the primary source is1 m 1 m 1 m, and the distance between neighboringmicrophones is fixed as k/6, which is sufficient. It can beseen that the system starts functioning when L¼W¼ 4 m.Because h¼ 60, the equivalent size of the array, which isthe size of its projection on the plane perpendicular to n is2 m 2 m and it is still twice the size of the primary source.It can be concluded from Figs. 5 and 6 that, to achieve effec-tive directivity control, the minimum equivalent size of theerror microphone array should be twice the size of the pri-mary source.D. Effects of the distance between the microphonearray and the primary sourceFigures 7(a) and 7(b) show the NRs at 340 Hz for a7 7 error microphone array on a 3 3 m plane (the micro-phone spacing is k/2) when d¼ 0.2 and 0.4 m. In the simula-tions, Lx¼ Ly¼Lz¼ 1 m, h¼ 0, and u¼ 90. The NR in thedesired direction is less than 10 dB when d¼ 0.2 m eventhough the error microphone array satisfies the requirementsmentioned above; however, the NR increases when d¼ 0.4 m,which means the distance between the microphone array andprimary source affects the noise reduction performance aswell.The noise reduction when d¼ 0.2 m can be increasedwith more error microphones in the array. As can be seenfrom Fig. 7(c), when the microphone spacing is reduced toapproximately 1/3 the wavelength at 340 Hz, the noisereduction increases. The closer the microphone array is tothe primary source, the smaller the distance between neigh-boring microphones should be. This is similar to the rule innear-field acoustical holography, where the microphonespacing should be equal to or less than the distance betweenthe sound source and microphone array because a largemicrophone spacing will result in insufficient spatial sam-pling and cause aliasing in reconstruction.20To sum up, the simulations show that the proposed near-field error sensing strategy can effectively create a quietzone in the desired direction from the near to the far field.FIG. 4.

A smallermicrophone spacing is required when the array is close tothe primary source.IV. EXPERIMENTSThe experimental setup in the anechoic chamber is shownin Fig. 8. Two loudspeakers are used to simulate the primarysource and secondary source, respectively, and the distancebetween their centres is approximately 0.4 m. The origin ofthe coordinate is at the floor. The centre of the primary sourceis at (0, 0) m in the y-z plane and it faces the positive z direc-tion. The near-field error microphone array consists of 4 4microphones (microphone model: CHZ-213; preamplifiermodel: YG-201) evenly distributed on a 1.5 m 1.5 m plane,which is approximately 0.35 m in front of the primary sourceand parallel to the x-y plane. All the microphones were cali-brated using a B&K 4231 Sound Calibrator and their phasedifferences are less than 2 at 1000 Hz. The frequency ofinterest is 240 Hz. The signals picked up by the 16 errormicrophones are summed first and then fed into an activecontroller as a single input signal. A commercial adaptiveANC controller (TigerANC-II Lite) embedded with theFxLMS algorithm is used in the experiment.21,22The SPL within a 2.8 m 2.2 m area in the y-z plane(1.4 m< y< 1.4 m, 0.6 m< z< 2.8 m) in front of the errormicrophone array at a height of 0.9 m with and withoutcontrol and the corresponding noise reduction are shown inFig. 9. The numerical simulation results obtained with themeasured acoustic transfer functions and Eq. (9) are alsoincluded for comparison, which shows a local quiet zonewithin the direction perpendicular to the error microphonearray. The experimental noise reduction in Fig. 9(c) is simi-lar to the numerical simulation results in Fig. 9(f), whichdemonstrates the feasibility of the near-field error micro-phone array. There exist some differences between the simu-lation and experimental results because the system is hard toconverge to the best condition in experiments due to thebackground noise.Experiments with 16 error signals as 16 inputs to themulti-channel active controller were also carried out and theresults are shown in Fig. 10. In this case, the cost function isthe sum of the squared sound pressure at all the error micro-phones, which is the most commonly used cost function inactive noise control.22 The experimental and numerical sim-ulation results agree reasonably well in Fig. 10. It can befound by comparing Fig. 9(c) with Fig. 10(c) that the near-field error microphone arrangement achieves much highernoise reduction in the desired direction than the traditionalmulti-channel active noise control. With all the error signalssummed up, only a single-channel active controller isrequired, which minimizes the complexity and cost of theANC system.For broadband primary noise below 250 Hz, Fig. 11(a)shows the error signal (the sum of the 16 signals picked upby the error microphones) with and without control, whichshows apparent noise reductions within this frequency band.The noise reduction decreases above 200 Hz because of thelimited taps of the control filters but the noise reduction isstill more than 10 dB. Figures 11(b)–11(d) show the SPLs atthree different points in the far field, which are marked asasterisks in Fig. 12(a). It can be seen that the noise reductionin Fig. 11(c) is higher than that in Figs. 11(b) and 11(d)FIG. 8. (Color online) The experimental setup in an anechoic chamber.FIG. 9.

Acoust. Soc. Am. 144 (2), August 2018 Wang et al.because the point investigated in Fig. 11(c) is in the directionperpendicular to the error microphone array. It demonstratesthat directivity control of broadband noise can also beachieved with the error microphone array. The noise reduc-tion in Fig. 11(c) is limited around 200 Hz. This is partly dueto the limitation of the physical configurations of the second-ary source and error microphone array, as well as the fre-quency responses of the primary or secondary sources.Another reason might be the limited size of the anechoicchamber used for the experiment and that the boundaries arenot 100% sound absorbent, which makes the experimentalresults a little different from the numerical simulation resultsin the free field. These reasons will be further investigated inthe future.Figures 12(a)–12(c) show the primary SPLs in the 1/3octave band with central frequencies 100, 125, and160 Hz, and Figs. 12(d)–12(f) show the correspondingnoise reductions. It can be seen that the noise is signifi-cantly reduced in the direction perpendicular to the near-field error microphone array in the 1/3 octave band withthe central frequencies 100 and 125 Hz. Directivity controlis also achieved for the central frequency 160 Hz, but thenoise reduction is smaller. More microphones in a largerplane might help improve the performance within this 1/3octave band.For the error microphone array adjusted to have an angleof approximately 54 between the x-y plane, the SPLs andNRs in the y-z plane (1.4 m< y< 1.4 m, 1.0 m< z< 2.8 m)FIG. 10.

Am. 144 (2), August 2018 Wang et al. 605are shown in Fig. 13 with the noise reduction performancewith 16 separate error signals included for comparison.Similar to Figs. 9 and 10, the near-field error microphonearray achieves much better performance than 16 error sig-nals. It can be seen from Fig. 13(c) that the effective noisereduction direction is changed and still remains approxi-mately perpendicular to the error microphone array. Noisereduction in any direction can be achieved by placing thenear-field error microphone array perpendicular to the direc-tion or weighting the error signals according to Eq. (5)before summing them. In practical applications, the near-field microphone array could be easily implemented byinstalling the array perpendicularly to the desired noisereduction direction. If that is inconvenient or there isnot enough space for such a perpendicular installation, theerror signals ei(t) can be convolved with the designed timedelay filters first and then added up and fed into the activecontroller for minimization. The time delays are functions ofh, u, and x and y coordinates of the error microphones.Alternatively, the general complex weighting factors can beimplemented in frequency domain. By minimizing the sumof the error signals multiplied by the weighting factors, thestrengths of the secondary sources can be obtained and thentransformed into time domain with inverse fast Fourier trans-form (IFFT) and fed into the secondary sources.V. CONCLUSIONSIn order to reduce sound radiated to a certain direction,a new near-field error sensing strategy was developed byplacing a planar error microphone array near the primarysource and minimizing the weighted sum of the sound pres-sure at all these points. The weighting factor corresponds tothe phase shift from the error microphones to the plane per-pendicular to the direction where noise reduction is required.The effectiveness of the proposed strategy to achieve direc-tivity control from the near to the far field was demonstratedwith numerical simulations and the requirements on thenear-field error microphone array were discussed. It wasfound that the microphone spacing should be no more thanhalf the wavelength of the frequency of interest. The mini-mum equivalent size of the array is approximately twice thesize of the primary source when the secondary source isclose to the primary source. The distance between the errormicrophone array and primary source also affects the noisereduction performance and smaller microphone spacing isrequired when the array is close to the primary source.Experiment results in the anechoic chamber demonstratedthe feasibility of the proposed method. The possibility ofusing microphone arrays of other shapes such as sphericalmicrophone arrays to achieve directivity or even global con-trol will be investigated in the future.FIG. 12.
