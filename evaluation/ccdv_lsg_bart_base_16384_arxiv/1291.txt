ABSTRACT: 
A great deal of literature has examined the factors involved in single-goal pursuit. However, there is a burgeoning realization that employees hold multiple goals at any one point in time and that findings from the single-goal literature do not necessarily apply to multiple-goal situations. Research is now being conducted on multiple goals, but it is being conducted across a broad range of disciplines, examining different levels of the goal hierarchy. Consequently, researchers are using the same label to refer to distinct concepts (the “jangle” fallacy) or different labels to refer to similar concepts (the “jingle” fallacy), and some aspects of the multiple-goal space are yet to be examined. We derive seven general principles of the multiple-goal process from a broad review of the literature. In doing so, we provide a common architecture and an overarching perspective of the theory for ongoing research as well as highlighting a number of areas for future research.

MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 1Multiple Goals: A Review and Derivation of General PrinciplesUnsworth, K.L., Yeo, G., & Beck, J. (2014). Multiple goals: A review and derivation of generalprinciples. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 35(8), 1064-1078.A great deal of literature has examined the factors involved in single goal pursuit. However, thereis a burgeoning realization that employees hold multiple goals at any one point in time and thatfindings from the single goal literature do not necessarily apply to multiple goal situations.Research is now being conducted on multiple goals, but it is being conducted across a broadrange of disciplines, examining different levels of the goal hierarchy. Consequently, researchersare using the same label to refer to distinct concepts (the jangle fallacy) or different labels torefer to similar concepts (the jingle fallacy), and some aspects of the multiple goal space are yetto be examined. We derive seven general principles of the multiple goal process from a broadreview of the literature. In doing so, we provide a common architecture and an overarchingperspective of the theory for ongoing research as well as highlighting a number of areas for futureresearch.INTRODUCTIONIt is well established that goals are coremotivational constructs that influencebehavior (Locke & Latham, 2013). To date,research has primarily focused on single-goalsituations, but it is increasingly recognizedthat managing multiple goals is the normrather than the exception (Ashforth,Harrison, & Corley, 2008; Sun & Frese,2013; Vancouver, Weinhardt, & Schmidt,2010). Importantly though, given thecomplexities involved in the pursuit ofmultiple goals, it is unlikely that findingsfrom single goal research can be directlytranslated to the multiple goal contexts. Forexample, consider research regardingimplementation intentions: Diverse evidencefrom single goal contexts indicates that theseconscious acts of planning in pursuit of aparticular goal predict goal attainment (e.g.,Diefendorff & Lord, 2003; Gollwitzer &Brandstatter, 1997). However, recentresearch suggests they are not beneficial inmultiple goal contexts because theassociated planning highlights the difficultiesthat are involved in managing multiple goalsand thus reduces goal commitment (Daltonand Spiller (2012).Fortunately, research on multiple goals hasbegun to emerge across a wide variety ofdisciplines. These include Developmental(e.g., Hofer, 2010) and EducationalPsychology (e.g., Berger, 2012),Experimental Social Psychology (e.g., Koo &Fishbach, 2008), Industrial/OrganizationalPsychology (I/O psychology: e.g., Vancouveret al., 2010), Management (e.g., Ethiraj &Levinthal, 2009), Marketing (e.g., Dalton &Spiller, 2012), Organizational Behaviour(OB: e.g., Bateman, O'Neill, & Kenworthy-U'Ren, 2002), Social Psychology (e.g.,Sheldon & Elliot, 1999), and SportsPsychology (e.g., Carr, 2006). Researchersgenerally agree that goals are hierarchicallyMULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 2structured (see Austin & Vancouver, 1996)and research varies from a focus on long-term goals such as values and identitiesat higher levels of the hierarchy to projectgoals and day-to-day tasks at lower levels.This diversity in multiple goal researchefforts has great potential to advanceknowledge. Indeed, the divergence inapproaches has yielded a variety of uniquefindings and theoretical insights. However,this diversity has also resulted in a dilemma,which we refer to as the elephant problem.Specifically, we see a parallel between thecurrent state of the multiple goal literatureand an Indian parable in which several blindmen strive to learn about an elephant. Oneman touches the tail and reaches theconclusion that the elephant is like a rope;another touches the trunk and concludes theelephant is like a tree; and so forth. Byexamining only one aspect of the elephant inisolation, each man draws conclusions that,although true for some aspects of theelephant, do not represent the elephant as awhole.Similarly, multiple goal research ischaracterized by separate streams that areexamining different aspects of the multiplegoal space in isolation of each other. Webelieve this situation is problematic forfuture advancement of multiple goalresearch. Two primary problems relate tothe jingle and jangle fallacies (Kelley,1927), which both concern impediments tothe development of a common vocabularyand architecture. The jingle fallacy occurswhen the same label is used for two distinctconstructs or phenomena. For example, thebroad concept of multiple goals has takenon different meanings depending uponwhether the multiplicity occurs across levelsof the hierarchy, such as studying how goalsat one level of abstraction (e.g., collegecourse goals) influence goals at another level(e.g., college exam goals; Campion & Lord,1982), or within levels, such as studying howseparate aspects of one goal (e.g., speed vs.accuracy) compete for attention andresources (e.g., Locke et al., 1994).Similarly, the concept of multiple goalpursuit has been used when consideringboth simultaneous (e.g., Schmidt & DeShon,2007) and sequential (e.g., Leroy, 2009;Madjar & Shalley, 2008) goal pursuit. Thejangle fallacy occurs when different labelsare used to refer to the same construct orphenomenon. For example, the term goalhierarchy is used in OB, whereas goalsystems is used in experimental socialpsychology, yet both refer to the overarchingstructure of goals. This example and othershave resulted in the development ofindependent research silos and thusrepresent missed opportunities forknowledge integration. For instance,knowledge of goal hierarchies is likely toinform understanding of goal systems andvice versa; and likewise for ourunderstanding of managing multipleidentities versus multiple tasks. Fallaciessuch as the jingle and jangle impede thedevelopment of a common language andframework, making it difficult for multiplegoal researchers to build on the work ofothers (see also Vancouver et al., 2010).The multiple-goal space is large andcomplex, so it makes sense that the literaturehas progressed in the manner describedabove. Yet, we see this as a potentialwatershed moment for the goal pursuitliterature. If the status quo is maintained,multiple goal research may continue toevolve along distinct pathways, hindering usfrom ever seeing the whole elephant.However, we believe that enough knowledgeabout multiple goals has accumulated suchthat general principles of the multiple goalprocess can be extracted. Doing so requiresMULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 3a broad review and organization of themultiple goal literature, which is theapproach taken in the current manuscript.Specifically, we reviewed the research acrossmultiple disciplines and identified a broadrange of articles that collectively address abroad spectrum of the goal hierarchy.Keywords were based on the heuristic levelsmentioned above (multiple tasks, goals,identities, values) and terminology usedwithin these literatures (e.g., dual tasks, goalsystems, goal hierarchy, dual identities,identity integration). We derived a set ofmultiple goal principles from this literature,which we define as general rules thatcharacterize how the given aspect of the goalprocess operates. In the following sections,we present the multiple goal principles thatwe have generated from our review anddiscuss our interpretation of this holisticperspective of multiple goal research interms of implications for current knowledgeand future research.Multiple Goal PrinciplesWe derived seven general principles fromthe multiple-goal literature that summarizethe evidence and associated conclusionsaccumulated from research to date (seeTable 1). To begin, we discuss the basicframework of multiple goals within thehierarchy. The first principle contains twosub-principles; one refers to the structure ofmultiple goals within the hierarchy and theother outlines how they are activated(Principles 1a and 1b). The remainingprinciples can be roughly mapped ontovarious stages of the goal process; namely,how goal conflict is managed via goalalignment (Principle 2) or prioritization (as afunction of the mechanisms of goal-basedinformational and affective value, goal-performance discrepancies and expectancy;Principles 3-6) and the goal shieldingconsequences of prioritization (Principle 7).As indicated in Table 1, the evidence usedto support each of these general principlesvaries according to the discipline/s fromwhich it originated and the level of the goalhierarchy that was the focus when generatingthe evidence. We highlight these differencesin our review, and refer to them in ourdiscussion of what we know and where weneed to go.Principle 1: Goal Structure & ActivationThe issues of goal structure (i.e., how thegoals exist in relation to each other) andactivation (i.e., when a goal is triggered) areaddressed across a wide range of disciplinesand there is broad consensus across theseareas (e.g., Austin & Vancouver, 1996;Cropanzano, James, & Citera, 1993;DeShon & Gillespie, 2005). With regard tostructure, researchers agree that goals can becategorized, albeit crudely, into ahierarchical structure of levels ranging frommore concrete goals at lower levels to moreabstract goals at higher levels (e.g., DeShon& Gillespie, 2005). Indeed, such a goalstructure was also proposed to reflect anindividuals personality (Cropanzano et al.,1993).However, within this broad consensus thereare a variety of terms which are used.Therefore, in order to establish a commonvocabulary, we now introduce the terms weuse for each level and their definitions. Wedefine tasks to be specific behaviors such asteaching a class, catching the bus to work,and so on. These tasks are at the bottom ofthe goal hierarchy, thus they correspond tothe notion of means in goal systems theory(Kruglanski et al., 2002), the task goals ingoal hierarchy models (Cropanzano et al.,1993), the goals in multiple goal pursuittheory (Vancouver et al., 2010), and theachievement tasks in the self-regulationmultiple goal model (Lord, Diefendorff,MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 4Schmidt, & Hall, 2010). At the next highestlevel are the long-term project goals that anindividual might have, also called personalprojects (Little, 1983, 1989), personal goals(Winell, 1987) or achievement goals(DeShon & Gillespie, 2005). These goalscould include performance goals (such as ajournal paper), collegiality and citizenshipgoals (such as maintain a supportive team),non-work goals (such as keep the houseclean, spend time with the family), and soon. At the next level of goal abstraction are apersons identities (Cropanzano et al., 1993),possible selves (Lord et al., 2010; Strauss,Griffin, & Parker, 2012) or principle goals(DeShon & Gillespie, 2005); and at the topof the goal system hierarchy sits a personsvalues (Cropanzano et al., 1993) and self-goals (DeShon & Gillespie, 2005). Thesehigher-level goals are the most abstract andexist for longer periods of time than thelower-level goals (Bateman et al., 2002).We acknowledge that these differentiationsare only heuristics and that the complexityof this domain is such that neatcategorizations are not always possible. Forexample, the hierarchy is likely to consist oflevels within levels (e.g., collective identityversus personal identity) and overlap acrosslevels (e.g., longer-term tasks acting asproject goals, or self-defining identities actingas values). Nonetheless, we adopt theproposed hierarchy as an organizingarchitecture because it is conceptuallyimportant to contrast the relative position ofvarious goals in the hierarchy (i.e., higher- vslower-level goals).Principle 1a: Goals exist in a hierarchy fromlong-term abstract multiple values at the topof the hierarchy, through multiple identities,multiple project goals, and multiple tasks.Now we turn to a discussion of goalactivation. Goal activation is thought to be afunction of the connections between goals(Kruglanski et al., 2002). Theorizing andempirical research have shown that goals canbe cognitively linked to each other betweenand within goal hierarchy levels forming aconnectionist architecture similar to a neuralnetwork (Hanges, Lord, & Dickson, 2000).Connections refer to the linkages betweenthe mental representations of the goals. Aconnection between two goals is describedas facilitative if achieving one goal helpsachievement of the other; this connectionthen triggers goal activation. A connection isdescribed as inhibitory if achieving one goalimpedes achievement of the other; this typeof connection blocks activation (Kruglanskiet al., 2002). Thus, when a particular goal isactivated, all other goals which areconnected to that goal will either beactivated (if connected through a facilitativelink) or inhibited from activating (ifconnected through an inhibiting link) (seee.g., Lord & Brown, 2001; Lord, Brown, &Freiberg, 1999). If goals are unrelated toeach other then there is no connection andno corresponding activation pattern. Forexample, if your identity as a researcher isactivated, then the project goals that havefacilitative connections to that identity (e.g.,write papers, analyze data) are activated,those that have inhibitive connections (e.g.,do paperwork, answer emails) aredampened from activating, and those whichare unrelated (e.g., eat healthy food, walkthe dog) are not affected. To date, empiricalresearch has identified the existence of suchconnections at the lowest two levels of thehierarchy (e.g., Manneti et al., 2009) butonly inferred their existence at the higherlevels through correlations (e.g., Oishi,Schimmack, Diener, & Suh, 1998; Sosik,Jung, & Dinger, 2009) or theorizing (e.g.,DeShon & Gillespie, 2005).MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 5Principle 1b: When a goal is activated, apattern of activation occurs such that goalswith facilitative connections are alsoactivated and goals with inhibitiveconnections are not.If the pattern of goal activation is such thatmultiple competing goals are activated at thesame time, then goal conflict ensues as theperson must resolve incompatible actiontendencies (see e.g., Stroebe, Mensink,Aarts, Schut, & Kruglanski, 2008). If leftunresolved, research shows that detrimentaleffects ensue  whether that be increasedstress (e.g., Dickson & Moberly, 2010;Emsley, 2003; Sheldon & Emmons, 1995)or decreased goal attainment (e.g., Hofer,2007, 2010; Li & Chan, 2008; Soman &Min, 2011). Thus, employees are driven toresolve this goal conflict (Laran &Janiszewski, 2008). In Principle 2, wediscuss the notion of goal alignment as onestrategy for managing goal conflict. Then inPrinciples 3-6, we discuss the moretraditional notion of goal prioritization as away to deal with conflicting goals.Principle 2: Goal AlignmentThe notion of goal alignment has beeninvestigated in the social psychology andmanagement literatures and has primarilyfocussed on the project goal and identitylevels of the goal hierarchy (see e.g., Sluss &Ashforth, 2008). Though not explicitlylabelled as such in this literature, we proposethat goal alignment reflects a strategy forresolving goal conflict. We define goalalignment as the act of cognitively reframingthe representation of goals to highlight theircommonalities and reduce their differences.Two types of goal alignment strategies haveemerged. The first type relates to aligningthe conflicting goals themselves eitherthrough integrating goals into a compoundgoal (e.g., Karoly et al., 2005; Kreiner,Hollensbe, & Sheep, 2006) or nestingconflicting goals by conceiving one as ahigher-level goal (e.g., Ashforth, Rogers, &Corley, 2010; Brewer, 1999). For example,within the identity literature a number ofstudies have looked at how employees dealwith holding organizational, professionaland/or personal identities by creating acompound or focusing on the overlap of theidentities (e.g., George & Chattopadhyay,2005; Sundaramurthy & Kreiner, 2008; vanDick, Van Knippenberg, Kerschreiter,Hertel, & Wieseke, 2008). Similarly,research has looked at managing multipleidentities by nesting one within asuperordinate identity such as having acultural identity nested within the nationalidentity (Hopkins, 2011; Simon, Reichert, &Grabow, 2013; Simon & Ruhs, 2008), adiscipline identity within the universityidentity (Hornsey & Hogg, 2002; Wenzel,Mummendey, & Waldzus, 2007), or adepartmental identity within anorganizational identity (e.g., Edwards &Peccei, 2010; Ishii, 2012; Reade, 2001).The second approach to goal alignment isthrough finding commonality in the tasksconnected to the conflicting goals. Kopetz,Faber, Fishbach, and Kruglanski (2011)found that goal conflict could be avoidedthrough identifying a lower-order goal thatsatisfies all the activated higher-order goals.Nonetheless, they also found that this wasmoderated by the extent to which suchcommonality was feasible  if there were notasks that were connected to the conflictingproject goals then goal alignment was notpossible.Principle 2: Goal alignment occurs throughmerging or nesting goals, or identifying alower-order goal that satisfies all activatedgoals.MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 6When multiple conflicting goals are notaligned, one goal must be prioritized toresolve conflict around the allocation ofresources. Most of the multiple goalliterature in the I/O, OB and experimentalsocial psychology disciplines focuses on goalprioritization, which refers to the act ofdirecting resources to one of the activatedgoals and not to the others. Next we discussfour principles regarding factors thatinfluence which goal is prioritized.Principle 3: Prioritization  Goal-BasedInformational ValueThe OB and experimental social psychologydisciplines argue that the connectionistpattern associated with a given goal providesinformational value that influences goalprioritization (see also Forster, Liberman, &Friedman, 2007). Goal-based informationalvalue refers to information regarding thedegree to which the goal is valuable for, orhelps to achieve, goals at other levels asindicated by the goals pattern ofconnections. Although this literature is notexplicit regarding the underlyingmechanisms, the arguments proposed alignwith expectancy theories  namely, thegreater the informational value of the goal,the more likely it is to be prioritized as it willhave a greater subjective expected utility(Klein, 1989). Research has primarilyconsidered the informational value indicatedby the intersection between the task andproject goal levels of the hierarchy.Interestingly, to our knowledge, no researchhas directly measured the informationalvalue of goals, instead they measureindicators of value, namely multifinality,equifinality and self-concordance. A goalsmultifinality (Kruglanski et al., 2013) refersto the number of higher-order goals it hasfacilitative connections with and can beconsidered colloquially as bang for thebuck. A goals equifinality (Kruglanski,Pierro, & Sheveland, 2011; Winell, 1987),on the other hand, is the number of lower-order goals that a goal has facilitativeconnections with; in other words, thenumber of different ways there are forachieving a goal. The term self-concordancefocuses on the task level (likely a function ofthe focus of research to date) and refers tothe degree to which a particular task is moreor less densely interconnected throughfacilitative connections with higher-orderproject goals, identities and values (Adriasola& Unsworth, 2011; Ford, 1992; Little, 1989;Sheldon & Kasser, 1995). Thus, high levelsof multifinality, equifinality and self-concordance for a given goal are associatedwith higher informational value.Multifinality and self-concordance thereforerelate to upward connections.Theoretically, then, the more a task orproject goal has upward facilitativeconnections, the more informational value ithas because it helps to achieve more higher-order goals (Kruglanski et al., 2002).Consequently, multifinality and self-concordance should be positively associatedwith indicators of prioritization. Indeed,empirical research in experimental socialpsychology finds that tasks with highermultifinality are the ones which are chosenand pursued (Chun, Kruglanski, Sleeth-Keppler, & Friedman, 2011; Kruglanski etal., 2013; Kruglanski & Orehek, 2009) andempirical OB research shows that higherself-concordance is related to greatermotivation and more effort allocation(Adriasola, Steele, Day, & Unsworth, 2011;Adriasola, Unsworth, & Day, 2012; Bono &Judge, 2003; Molina, Unsworth,Hodkiewicz, & Adriasola, 2013; Sheldon &Elliot, 1999).Equifinality relates to downwardconnections. Based on the availabilityheuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974),MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 7theoretical and empirical research suggestthat the more tasks that are attached to agoal, i.e., equifinality, the more likely anindividual is to be committed to that goal(Kruglanski et al., 2011). It is worth noting,however, that recent studies suggest that theincreased motivation produced byequifinality occurs only at the early stages ofthe goal attainment process (Huang &Zhang, 2013).Principle 3: Goals with the greatest goal-based informational value, as reflected bymultifinality, equifinality and self-concordance are more likely to beprioritized.Principle 4: Prioritization - Goal-BasedAffective ValueAnother factor that can influenceprioritization is the degree of positive affectassociated with a goal (Custers, 2009).Following Zajonc (1980), we define goal-based affective value as the degree to whichthe goal is associated with positive feelings.In comparison to goal-based informationalvalue which is a more rational constructionof value (what goal should I pursue?),goal-based affective value is the emotionalconstruction of value (what goal do I wantto pursue?).When considering the role of affect inmultiple goal pursuit, work has primarilybeen conducted within the experimentalsocial psychology discipline and has focusedon the task and project goal levels of thehierarchy. This work has shown that goalsassociated with positive affect are morelikely to be prioritized because theyrepresent a highly desired state (e.g., Custers& Aarts, 2007). This positive affective valuemay be created externally through the co-activation of positive affect with the goal(e.g., through the subliminal presentation ofpositive words before the goal presentation;Custers, 2009; Custers & Aarts, 2005).Alternatively, the affective value may comefrom connected goals. Similar to the processof cognitive activation described earlier,empirical research has shown that bothpositive and negative affect are transferredfrom the higher-level goal with which it wasoriginally associated to lower-level goalsthrough their connections (Fishbach, Shah,& Kruglanski, 2004). That is, a goal that haspositive affect will transfer that affect to anyother goals with a facilitative connection toit. For example, imagine a person who has agoal of attending a conference. This goalhas high positive affective value for him orher (i.e., they feel very positive about theanticipated experience) and can be achievedby working on a particular paper; therefore,the task of working on that paper is alsoimbued with high positive affective value andthus is more likely to be prioritized.Principle 4: Goals associated with positiveaffective value are more likely to beprioritized.Principle 5: Prioritization - Goal-Performance DiscrepanciesResearchers within the I/O and socialpsychology disciplines have drawn oncontrol theories to propose that goal-performance discrepancies (GPD; i.e., thediscrepancy between the current and desiredstate) influence which goal is prioritized(e.g., Carver & Scheier, 1982; Klein, 1989).GPDs are proposed to represent an errorsignal that alerts the individual of the need toreduce the discrepancy. Thus, in general,the goal with the largest GPD is expected tobe prioritized. This work has typically beenconducted at the level of tasks and, insupport of the arguments, studies haveshown that GPDs are related to the amountof effort directed toward a task (Johnson,MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 8Chang, & Long, 2006; Kernan & Lord,1990).It should be noted that some authors havequestioned the centrality of GPDs role inself-regulation (e.g., Bandura, 2013;Bandura, & Locke, 2003; Locke, 1991).Specifically, these authors argue that thedesire to reduce GPDs is unlikely to beadaptive, as individuals could abandon theirgoals to reduce GPDs. Rather, the authorsargue that discrepancy production  in otherwords, setting new goals  is likely the key tosuccessful behavior. However, using bothcomputational models and empirical datacollected from lab and field sources, it hasbeen demonstrated that discrepancyproduction arises as a result of discrepancyreduction at higher levels of the goalhierarchy (e.g., Campion & Lord, 1982;Donovan & Williams, 2003; Scherbaum &Vancouver, 2010). Furthermore, goalabandonment has disadvantages that likelyoutweigh the benefit of eliminating its GPD,such as the creation of discrepancies athigher levels of the hierarchy (e.g., identities,values). Thus, we view discrepancyreduction as a fundamental driver ofmultiple-goal prioritization.Principle 5: Goals with the largest GPDs aremore likely to be prioritized.Principle 6: Prioritization - ExpectancyOur final prioritization principle relates toexpectancy. Expectancy is defined as thebelief that effort will result in desiredoutcomes, such as a specific level of taskperformance (Vroom, 1964). Individuals useexpectancy to prioritize multiple goals, oftenallocating resources towards goals with thehighest expectancy (Van Eerde & Thierry,1996). Yet, the relationship betweenexpectancy and goal prioritization is likelymore complex than a simple positive linearrelationship (Vancouver, More, & Yoder,2008). Rather, a variety of work has shownthat the relationship between expectancyand goal prioritization is variable, such thatpositive and negative linear effects have beenobserved, as well as non-monotoniccurvilinear effects. Much of this work andsurrounding debate has been conductedwith regard to self-efficacy (e.g., Bandura,2012; Vancouver, More, & Yoder, 2008;Yeo & Neal, 2013), a form of expectancydescribed as beliefs in ones capabilities toorganize and execute the courses of actionrequired to produce given attainments(Bandura, 1997, p. 3).For instance, in a study of dual-goalprioritization, Schmidt and Dolis (2009)showed that when participants thought theycould accomplish both goals, time wasallocated approximately equally between thegoals. Yet, when participants did not thinkthey could accomplish both goals, the goalwith the higher expectancy was prioritized.In another multiple goal study, Louro,Pieters, & Zeelenberg (2007) showedexpectancy for one goal had an inverse-Urelationship with the effort allocated to thatgoal, such that moderate levels ofexpectancy resulted in the highest amount ofeffort, compared to very low (when there islittle chance of success) and very high (whensuccess is virtually assured) levels ofexpectancy. Similarly, Beck and Schmidt(2012) demonstrated a non-monotonicrelationship between self-efficacy andresource allocation. Specifically, increases inself-efficacy were positively related toresource allocation for people starting froma generally low level of self-efficacy, yetpeople who are already very confidentreduced their resource allocation as theybecome even more efficacious.Principle 6: A goals expectancy will affect itslikelihood of prioritization depending uponthe expectancy of other goals.MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 9Principle 7: Goal ShieldingThe final principle relates to the goalshielding consequences of goalprioritization. This research has primarilybeen conducted within the experimentalsocial psychology discipline from a goalsystems theoretical perspective. Goalshielding is the process whereby non-prioritized goals are inhibited (i.e.,shielded) as a consequence ofprioritization. Further, just as the non-prioritized goals are forgotten, any lower-order goals that have connections to thenon-prioritized higher-order goals are alsothought to be forgotten (Shah, Friedman, &Kruglanski, 2002). This shielding isproposed to occur due to the inhibitoryconnections between them (Shah et al.,2002) and to the memory process ofretrieval-based forgetting (McCullough,Aarts, Fujita, & Bargh, 2008).Empirical research regarding goal shieldinghas primarily focused on the project goallevel of the goal hierarchy and evidencesupports the proposed arguments. Forexample, when individuals have an activatedgoal, they have been shown to report fewerdistractions and less cognitive interferencesuggesting the shielding from other goals(Strickland & Galimba, 2001).Principle 7: When one goal is prioritized,non-prioritized goals (and lower-level goalsassociated with the non-prioritized goals) areshielded.Dynamics & Integration of PrinciplesIn this section we review past workrelated to the integration of principles andthe dynamic process of multiple goalpursuit. We have derived seven generalmultiple-goal principles from the literature.We presented them separately to highlightthe core concepts that have arisen fromtheory; however, we are not arguing that theyoperate statically or in isolation of eachother. Instead, consistent with the view thatthe multiple goal process is dynamic andgoverned by a complex set of interrelatedfactors (e.g., Sun & Frese, 2013; Vancouveret al., 2010), our review suggests that thesegeneral principles operate in concert witheach other and that the factors incorporatedin the principles change over time.Unfortunately, there has been limited workto date around the integration of theprinciples. Given the complexity of theprocesses involved and the difficulties incollecting appropriate field data it is perhapsnot surprising that little empirical work hasexamined the integration of the principles.Two notable exceptions are the works ofSchmidt and Vancouver (see also Forster etal., 2007; Steel & Konig, 2006 for integrationin single-goal contexts).A number of studies by Schmidt andcolleagues (Schmidt & DeShon, 2007;Schmidt & Dolis, 2009; Schmidt, Dolis, &Tolli, 2009) have looked at the interactionbetween GPD, expectancy and errorsensitivity (i.e., the degree to which a personis sensitive to GPD  what we consider to bean alternative conceptualization of valuebecause a goal that is highly valued will havehigher error sensitivity than a goal that is notvalued). Vancouver and colleagues (Ballard,Yeo, Loft, Vancouver, & Neal, 2014;Vancouver et al., 2010; Vancouver,Weinhardt, & Vigo, 2014) have developedcomputational models that integrate thesesame principles of GPD (called valence),expectancy and a broad conceptualisation ofgoal importance or value (called gain) toprovide a more precise explanation of theprocess by which multiple goals areprioritized. Furthermore, this work alsoexamines the changing nature of the processby presenting a computational model thatMULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 10specifies GPDs, expectancy, and value asdynamic variables (Vancouver et al., 2010).This model recognizes, for example, thatdecisions to act on a prioritized goal canchange the GPDs of one or more goals, andthese changes (weighted by the value of thegoal), as well as the passage of time, canaffect expectancies; further, the nature ofthese changes should influence subsequentprioritization decisions (e.g., Ballard et al.,2014; Fishbach, Friedman, & Kruglanski,2003; Fishbach & Zhang, 2008). This modelhas been shown to account for existingempirical findings such as the effect ofincentives on prioritization and the tendencyto switch priority from the goal that has theleast likelihood of attainment to the goal thathas the greatest likelihood of attainment as adeadline approaches.In addition to work from I/O psychology,experimental social psychology research hasalso examined the dynamics of multiple goalprocessing; it has been demonstrated thatsituational or non-conscious cues mayactivate higher-order goals (termed bottom-up activation) provoking a reassessment ofthe perceived value of goals and subsequentresource allocation (e.g., Aarts &Dijksterhuis, 2000; Bargh, Gollwitzer, Lee-Chai, Barndollar, & Trotschel, 2001; Lord& Brown, 2001). For example, if you decideto take the bus home but then see a sign onthe bus about being healthy, that mightactivate your health project goal and promptyou to get off a stop or two early to walk therest of the way.Finally, both I/O psychology andexperimental social psychology literatureagree that, over time, momentary decisionsare thought to collectively emerge asdynamic prioritization patterns (Ballard etal., 2014; Vancouver et al., 2014) and habits(Aarts & Dijksterhuis, 2000). Individualsmay strive for multiple goals sequentially,alternate between the two, or emphasize oneover the other, and these patterns candepend on environmental and individualdifference variables (e.g., Fishbach & Zhang,2008; Louro, Pieters, & Zeelenberg, 2007;Schmidt et al., 2009).DiscussionWe started our paper with the premise thatthe research on multiple goals was anexemplar elephant problem  thatdifferent literatures were covering differentaspects of the phenomenon. Examination ofTable 1 shows this to be the case. Theprinciples can be likened to the body partsof the elephant and the disciplines areundergoing the investigation separately.Although multiple goal researchersindividually may be aware of othersresearch, our review has attempted toaddress this problem more broadly byhelping everyone to see all the parts of theelephant together. Our broad, principle-based approach allows a critique of multiplegoal research within a common architecture.That is, consideration of multiple goalpursuit requires acknowledgement that goalsexist in a hierarchical structure and areactivated according to their pattern ofconnections; activated goals can either bealigned or prioritized; and prioritization isinfluenced by value (informational andaffective), GPDs and expectancies and alsohas goal shielding consequences. As shownbelow, using this broad lens to consider whatwe know about multiple goal pursuituncovers some jangle and jingle fallacies aswell as research gaps that provide anopportunity for theory building.The Jangle Fallacy and ItsImplicationsThe jangle fallacy occurs when differentnames are used to describe the samephenomenon. Assessing currentMULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 11understanding of multiple goal pursuitwithin the common architecture presentedhere highlights at least two examples of thejangle fallacy. First, we argue that the termsmultifinality and incentives from theexperimental social psychology and I/Opsychology literatures respectively, are usedto describe similar underlying processes.The I/O psychology literature hasdemonstrated that incentivized goals aremore likely to be prioritized (e.g., Schmidt &DeShon, 2007). We propose that incentivesare indicators of goal-based informationalvalue, specifically, multifinality. Anincentivized goal should enhancemultifinality by creating a connectionbetween that goal and a higher-order goalrelated to rewards. Monetary incentives areoften used in this literaturewe suggest thatthis reward creates a facilitative connectionbetween the incentivized goal and thehigher-order goal of financial gain.Furthermore, other research finds that self-set tasks produce more motivation thantasks which have monetary rewards (e.g.,Erez, Gopher, & Arzi, 1990), and thesefindings can also be explained viamultfinalitynamely, self-set tasks are likelyto be connected to other higher-order goals(e.g., achievement) beyond monetaryincentives. Future research could employ ahierarchical approach to determine whetherthe influence of incentives on prioritizationis indeed explained by the multifinality ofincentivized goals.Second, the integrative models describedearlier by Schmidt and Vancouverincorporated a construct of value referring tothe importance of the goal. We propose thatPrinciples 3 and 4 (goal-based informationaland affective value) are more specificconceptualizations of goal value achieved bycreating a common architecture of a goalhierarchy. We therefore believe that thisrepresents an example of the jangle fallacyand that informational and affective valueare the source of the importance and valueidentified in Vancouver et al.s (2010)conception of gain and Schmidt andDeShons (2007) error sensitivity.This latter example also has widerimplications. The I/O psychology literaturepredominantly draws on control theories tosituate gain/error sensitivity as a moderatorof the effect of GPD (e.g., Schmidt &DeShon, 2007; Vancouver et al., 2010) suchthat GPDs are weighted more strongly andtheir subsequent effect on prioritization isstrengthened when the goal is of high value.On the other hand, research in OB andmanagement has treated value constructs asdirect causal predictors of goal prioritization(e.g., Bateman et al., 2002; Molina et al.,2013; Sosik et al., 2009). As the twoconcepts have been presented in differentliteratures under different labels, thisinconsistency has not been identified in thepast. We hope that our commonarchitecture promotes researchers toexamine whether goal-based informationaland affective values operate as directinfluences on prioritization or whether theymoderate the effects of other factors such asGPD.The Jingle Fallacy and Its ImplicationsThe jingle fallacy occurs when the sameterm is used to define different concepts. InPrinciple 1, we proposed a set of definitionsfor the wide range of phenomenaencountered within the field of multiplegoals and we hope this will help to reducethe linguistic jingle fallacies. Nevertheless,jingle fallacies remain, one of which wedescribe here.The phenomenon of connected goals existsin both the experimental social psychologyand the OB literatures. However, theMULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 12research assumes different underlyingmechanisms of the connectionistframework. The experimental socialpsychology literature draws on goal systemstheory to posit that the downwardconnections from a given goal to multiplelower-order goals are equally weighted  forexample, if there is one downwardconnection from a project goal of healthyteeth to the task of cleaning teeth, thatconnection would have a weighting of 1;however if there was an additionaldownward connection, such as flossing, thenthese two connections would each have aweighting of .50 (Kruglanski et al., 2002).Further, this literature argues that each goalhas the same degree of weight to spreadacross its downward connections. Forexample, the weightings of downwardconnections from a second project goal ofkeep fit (e.g., do exercise and stretches)would also add up to 1 (.50 each). Empiricalevidence in the OB literature, on the otherhand, suggests that multiple connectionswith a common goal can be differentiallyweighted and that goals can have differentamounts to spread across the lower-levelgoals. For example, Oishi et al. (1998)showed that there are different degrees ofconnectedness between certain values andcertain identities; Sosik et al. (2009) alsodemonstrated different connection strengthsbetween values and identities and betweenidentities and behaviour; and Adriasola andcolleagues have shown that employees areable to distinguish the strength of theconnection between the lower-order goalsand their associated higher-order goalswhich are then differentially related to lower-level behavior choice (Adriasola et al., 2011;Adriasola & Unsworth, 2011; Adriasola etal., 2012; Molina et al., 2013). Once again,prior to this review, these inconsistenciesexisted in different literatures and thereforewent undiscovered. It could be that thedifferent methodologies used by thedifferent disciplines may account for thefindings (experimental methods usingstudents compared to self-report survey datausing employees) or that a complexcombination of the two perspectives canaccount for the different results. This is, yetagain, another question which needs to beanswered by future research.Next Steps: Drawing the ElephantBy mapping out the principles that haveemerged from different disciplines, we havehighlighted a number of areas in themultiple goal space which need moreresearch. To return to our metaphor, wehave tried to draw a picture of the elephantusing existing knowledge, but we have foundthat the picture is incomplete. There are twofurther interrelated areas where we seescope for future research. The first relates toaddressing isolated research gaps; and thesecond relates to an integrative approach toresearch in this field.Inspection of Table 1 indicates that existingtheory and research has not been conductedacross all combinations of principles andlevels of the hierarchy. For example, we didnot locate any research regarding multiplevalues. Research is required to determinehow a person manages multiple values andwhether the principles outlined in ourreview generalize to the values level of thehierarchy. Further, we proposed that goalalignment and goal prioritization arealternative strategies for dealing withconflicting goals. However, goal alignmentresearch has primarily been conducted atthe level of identities; whereas goalprioritization research has primarily beenconducted at the lowest levels of thehierarchy. It is thus important to determinewhether Principle 2 (goal alignment)MULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 13generalizes to lower levels of the hierarchy;and whether Principles 3-6 (prioritization)generalize to higher levels. For example, doGPDs influence prioritization of multipleidentities and values? Perceptions of currentand desired goal states may be less preciseand more difficult to compare for thesetypes of goals due to the higher levels ofabstraction. Does this mean that GPDs willhave a weaker influence on prioritization foridentities and values, or possibly even be ameaningless construct in these contexts?Another example relates to goal shieldingresearch  this work has been carried out atthe lowest two levels of the goal hierarchyand it seems sensible to assume that goalshielding also occurs at higher levels (e.g.,when your work identity is activated thenyour home identity is shielded), butempirical evidence is lacking.A critical challenge for future research is toconduct more integrative work thatenhances understanding of how theprinciples operate together during multiplegoal pursuit. We believe that the commonarchitecture provided herein the form ofprinciples that relate to the basic frameworkof multiple goals, how goal conflict ismanaged via goal alignment or prioritization,and the goal shielding consequences of goalprioritizationshould facilitate these efforts.For example, future work could clarify therelative weight of the various factors inpredicting prioritization. Some researchershave argued that affective value is the mostimportant factor for prioritization (Custers &Aarts, 2007), although others place GPD(Vancouver et al., 2010) or informationalvalue (Unsworth, Adriasola, Johnston-Billings, Dmitrieva, & Hodkiewicz, 2011) asbeing most important. Further, futureresearch should consider how theseprinciples intersect  for example, whatfactors lead a person to align their goalsrather than prioritizing them? Integrativework can also investigate whether theprinciples play out differently at differentlevels. For example, the amount of timeremaining before the deadline has beenshown to be crucial for the expectancy oflower-level goals (e.g., Vancouver et al.,2010)presumably because time is a limitedresource for tasks in this research; however,time to deadline may be less important forthe expectancy of higher-level goals such aslong-term projects or identities as deadlinesare more vague at these levels. Finally, whatare the implications for our understandingof multiple goal pursuit when goalprioritization is considered within ahierarchical, connectionist structure?Connections among goals may influenceperceptions of GPDs and expectancy inaddition to influencing informational andaffective value.ConclusionIn conclusion, this paper has turned aspotlight onto the elephant of multiplegoals. There is a clear need to conduct moreresearch into multiple goals both because ofits prominent nature in employees lives (wecannot keep ignoring the elephant in theroom, so to speak) and because findingsfrom single goal research may not applydirectly. Our integrative review found thatboth the jingle and jangle fallacy exist in themultiple goal space. We incorporatedresearch from different disciplines acrossdifferent levels of goals (including tasks,project goals, identities and values) andderived seven general principles which webelieve characterize the multiple goal spaceat a broad level. But the work is not yetcomplete. There are still many unansweredquestions such as how we resolveinconsistences between different disciplines,whether the results at one level correspondwith the findings from other levels, andMULTIPLE GOAL PRINCIPLES - 14whether the factors operate in the same wayacross the different levels of abstraction.Importantly, much more research isrequired to understand how the principlesoperate together. We hope that this reviewacts both as a call to action and as acommon architecture with which the fieldcan compose an integrated theory. We arestill left with many questions, but we hopethat we have now begun to clarify what weknow about the elephant and what we stillneed to discover.REFERENCESAarts, H., & Dijksterhuis, A. (2000).
