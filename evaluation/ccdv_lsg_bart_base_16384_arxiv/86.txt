ABSTRACT: 
Recognition memory for Spanish-Catalan cognate and noncognate words was tested at retention intervals of 30 minutes, 3 days, and 7 days using a remember/know response procedure. We observed a clear mirror effect for the cognate-noncognate stimulus class and a remember-know response categorisation at the immediate retention interval. However, the cognate and noncognate mirror was still observed at 3 and 7 days, whereas the remember-know mirror disappeared at both retention intervals. Also, we ran a repeated testing condition to be able to carry out a sequential item analysis and observe the fate of the original remember and know responses 3 or 7 days later. The analysis supported the idea that there was a loss of contextual information that was at the root of the disappearance of the remember-know mirror effect. These results provide support to the idea that it is the imbalance between recollection and familiarity that is the most likely cause of the mirror effect.

We observed a clear mirroreffect for the cognate-noncognate stimulus class and a remember-know response categorisation at theimmediate retention interval. However, the cognate and noncognate mirror was still observed at 3 and 7days, whereas the remember-know mirror disappeared at both retention intervals. Also, we ran a repeatedtesting condition to be able to carry out a sequential item analysis and observe the fate of the originalremember and know responses 3 or 7 days later. The analysis supported the idea that there was a loss ofcontextual information that was at the root of the disappearance of the remember-know mirror effect.These results provide support to the idea that it is the imbalance between recollection and familiarity thatis the most likely cause of the mirror effect.On a recognition test it is quite frequent to findthat one class of stimuli gives rise to higher hitsand lower false alarms than another. This so-called mirror effect is one of the most importantexplanatory problems for recognition memorytheories because the pattern is difficult to explainin a simple way based on single factor theories ofrecognition memory (e.g., Gillund & Shiffrin,1984; Glanzer & Adams, 1990; Hintzman, 1988;Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997). If we assume, as singleprocess theorists do, that items presented at test-ing vary simply along a single dimension offamiliarity, then the difficulty lies in the need topostulate simultaneously that test items have ahigh strength when old and a low one when new,given that both have been extracted from the samestimulus class. Some single process theories havepostulated that subjects use likelihood ratios(Glanzer & Adams, 1990; Shiffrin & Steyvers,1997), instead of memory strength, as the basis fortheir decision. A simpler explanation has beenintroduced recently in the form of two-processtheories (Joordens & Hockley, 2000; Reder,Nhouyvansivong, Schunn, Ayers, Angstadt, &Hiraki, 2000). According to these theories, thehigher hit rate in the mirror pattern is due to thefact that the corresponding stimulus class showsmore possibilities of recollection (greater distinc-tiveness), whereas the lower false alarms are dueto inferior pre-experimental familiarity.The two-process theory also offers a straight-forward explanation of the results in theremember-know (r-k) literature (Gardiner &Richardson-Klavehn, 2000) and the correspond-ing mirror (see Reder et al., 2000). The remember-know mirror is defined as the pattern of data inwhich more remember hits are associated withfewer false alarms than their corresponding knowhits and false alarms. If ``remember'' is associatedwith greater recollection than know, and viceversa with regard to familiarity, two-process the-ories could also predict a remember-know mirror.This seemingly simple explanation has provento have considerable predictive power.

This reduction is also presentwhen the overall results are partitioned as afunction of confidence or r-k response categor-isation (Hockley, Hemsworth, & Consoli, 1999;Joordens & Hockley, 2000). When pseudowordsare not recollectable, due to their novelty, they donot show a mirror pattern. Only after a familiar-isation phase does the mirror appear at a laterstage in training (Reder, Angstadt, Cary, Erick-son, & Ayers, 2002). Furthermore, the adminis-tration of midazolam (Hirshman, Fisher,Henthorn, Arndt, & Passannante, 2002)Ða sub-stance producing anterograde amnesia that sup-posedly affects the recollection processÐreversedthe mirror in favour of high-frequency words.Finally, when age is taken into account, the hitadvantage for low-frequency words is diminished,as in Alzheimer's disease patients (Balota, Bur-gess, Cortese, & Adams, 2002), which is congruentwith the well-known fact that there is a very steepdecrease in the ``remember'' type of recognitionwith age (e.g., Parkin & Walter, 1992). In con-clusion, the appeal to the dual processes ofrecollection and familiarity seems to provide amore straightforward explanation of the overalldata than a single view does.In the following experiment, we pursue twoclosely related goals. The first is to replicate themirror effect with a new stimulus class recentlyreported in the literature (Algarabel, Gotor, &Pitarque, 2003). The mirror effect has been foundfor stimuli such as word frequency, concreteness,imagery, meaningfulness, familiarity, picturesversus words (Glanzer & Adams, 1985; Glanzer,Adams, Iverson, & Kim, 1993) or distinctivenessof orthographic features (Malmberg, Steyvers,Stephens, & Shiffrin, 2002), to name but a fewstimulus classes. Our idea was to use stimuli fromone language with varying similarities to anotherlanguage, following the suggestion that to get amirror pattern the stimuli have to differ in recol-lective capabilities and previous familiarity (seeJoordens & Hockley, 2000). In fact, we have foundthat in a situation in which there were differencesin contextual information between two conditionsthat were equally familiar, the hit advantage forthe more recollectable class was present, but thefalse alarm advantage was not (Pitarque, Algar-abel, Gotor, & Luciano, 2003). In our case, wetook advantage of the Catalan-Spanish bilingual-ism, and assumed that cognate (c) words weremore familiar but less recollectable than non-cognate (nc) ones in the Catalan language. Webase this differential recollectability on the factthat Spanish is the dominant and familiar lan-guage, whereas Catalan is by contrast more dis-tinctive phonetically and phonologically (seeMalmberg et al., 2002; Rajaram, 1996; Rajaram &Geraci, 2000). There is clear evidence in favour ofthis interpretation (e.g., Reder et al., 2000),although it is not critical for the results that we willbe presenting.Second, and more importantly, we intend toobserve simultaneously the c-nc and the r-k mir-rors as a function of relatively intermediateretention intervals. We make the novel predictionthat an interaction between both types of mirrorsand the retention interval should be found if thetwo-process theory is correct, based on theassumption that both mirrors reflect a differentuse of recollection and familiarity. Traditionally,the remember-know paradigm is used in the lit-erature under the assumption that both responsesreveal a different balance in the use of recollectionand familiarity. Our hypothesis is that wordsincluded in an experimentally manipulated sti-mulus class, and defined as noncognate, are lessrecollectable by definition than those words self-selected by a participant through a rememberresponse. Further, we assume that context has amuch lower role than the item in recognition, asthe experiments on context change show (e.g.,Smith & Vela, 2001). By this account, we expectthat recollection suffers more from the effect ofdelay, and we should expect a greater impact ofretention interval on the r-k as compared to the c-nc mirror. Additionally, in the case where contextevidence is lost, we should also expect that ahigher proportion of remember responses wouldbecome know, as originally demonstrated byKnowlton and Squire (1995). If this were the case,the shift would indicate that subjects change theirjudgement from being more recollective to beingmore familiarity based. To substantiate this point,we will carry out an item analysis similar to thatperformed by Knowlton and Squire (1995,Experiment 3), in order to observe the fate of ther-k judgements and the responses given to cognateand non-cognate stimuli between successive tests.In a previous paper, Joordens and Hockley (2000)did not find a significant decrease in hits with veryshort retention intervals, although the effect wasin the correct direction, and they did find anunexpected increase in false alarms. Theyassumed that remember items were subject tomore forgetting than know items, an assumption80 ALGARABEL, PITARQUE, GOTORDownloaded by [University of Valencia] at 03:45 28 May 2015 that we believe is wrong. We also expect to shedlight on this point, because the transfer mechan-ism between the remember and know responsecategories will also explain why there is anincrease in false alarms over time.As mentioned previously, there are reasons tobelieve that the context in which the retentioninterval has been manipulated underestimatesforgetting in the know response category becausesome initially ``remembered'' items becomeknown after the loss of contextual information.The literature investigating the effect of retentioninterval shows that when participants are askedto categorise their recognition responses asremember or know, the remember responsedecreases or deteriorates more sharply than theknow response (Gardiner & Java, 1991, MaÈntylaÈ ,1994), at least within the first week or so (see alsoYonelinas, 2002). In fact, some of the reports inthe literature (Gardiner & Java, 1991) argue thatknow responses remain largely stable across avariety of relatively short retention intervals(although see for example Hockley & Consoli,1999). In any case, one can observe frequently(e.g., Knowlton & Squire, 1995) that although thedecrease in both remember and know responsesmay happen over delays of 1 week, the decreasein d' is produced for different reasons in eachcase. Whereas in the case of remember responsesthere is a pronounced deterioration in the hit partand a modest increase in the false alarm rate, inthe case of know responses the pattern is theopposite.In this experiment, the encoding task was toprovide the Spanish equivalent of a Catalanword. Two groups of participants were later tes-ted after 3 or 7 days (between subjects) on dif-ferent words requiring a recognition response anda remember-know judgement in sequence. Inorder to carry out the item analysis, we ran thesame conditions on two additional groups of sub-jects, but this time they were tested on the samestimuli.METHODParticipantsA total of 84 psychology students participated inthe experiment for course credit. All of themhad a perfect knowledge of Spanish but wereknowledgeable of Catalan as a second language todifferent degrees.Materials and procedureWe selected 168 Catalan words from Spanish-Catalan norms (Nacher, Gotor, & Algarabel,1998), half of which were cognates. The studyphase of the experiment consisted of a list of 94words, with the first and last 5 considered as pri-macy and recency buffers. We constructed twoseparate lists of the same lengths. Both lists wereequated on word frequency (Alameda & Cuetos,1995) in Spanish and Catalan (Gotor, Borras, &Perea, 1994) and length. Concretely, the specificmean values for the main parameters for both listswere 105 per 2 million (frequency), 5.6 (number ofletters), and 0.1 (similarity ratio); and 121, 5.52, and0.2 for noncognate lists A and B, respectively. Forcognates, the respective values were: 131 (fre-quency), 5.8 (length in letters), and 1 (Similarityratio) for list A; and 115, 5.86, and 1 for list B.The test lists were created according to thefollowing procedure. We divided each study listinto seven consecutive blocks of 12 words, andfrom each block we sampled 6 different words foreach of the two 42-word test lists. Both lists werecompleted with another 42 words from the alter-nate list following the same procedure. The pro-cess was carried out independently for eachparticipant, who received a different randomisedstudy list printed in a booklet. Participants weretold that their task was to provide the Spanishtranslation for each Catalan word in the blankspace provided to the right of each word, or leavethe space blank if they did not know the answer.They were also told that they would be tested withan unspecified memory test at a later point,although they did not know that they were goingto be tested twice.Each word was timed by the experimenter, andevery 5 seconds participants were told to advancea word, until the end of the list was reached, atwhich point the booklet was collected. The firsttest started 30 minutes after the study phase (n =84). The second test started 3 days later for onegroup (n = 22) and 7 days later for the other (n =19). The two tests were identical except for thedifferences in retention interval. In addition, twomore groups were run and tested twice with thesame words, at either 3- (n = 25) or 7-day delays (n= 18). In both cases old words, regardless of theirtranslation status, were randomly mixed with newwords from the alternate list in equal proportions.The second test was not announced in advance,and there were no environmental cues suggestingthat it was going to take place.THE MIRROR EFFECT 81Downloaded by [University of Valencia] at 03:45 28 May 2015 All tests were self-paced and completedquickly. The instructions given to the participantsasked for two responses to each stimulus. The firstresponse was a new/old discrimination, the second(only for yes responses), a remember/know/guess.The instructions followed others usually found inthe literature (e.g., Rajaram, 1996) with theaddition of instructions for ``guess''. If the initialresponse was ``old'', and they were able to bring tomind specific aspects of the previous occurrencelike details of the physical appearance, place in thelist, or any other image or idea that occurred at themoment of the presentation, they now had torespond ``I remember''. If they recognised theword as old, but were unable to recollect any otherspecific event, then they were to say, ``I know''.RESULTSThe level of guess responses was low (see Tables1±3), and they were excluded from further ana-lyses because they were not related to the mainhypothesis of the paper. The proportion of non-cognate words not translated in the study was14.07%, although, as will be shown, noncognatewords were better recognised. The significancelevel for all statistical tests was p < .01, unlessotherwise noted. For clarity we will analyse thestimulus class variable and the remember-knowresponse category independently for each reten-tion interval. We think that this strategy isnecessary for simplicity in the description,although we will return to a finer-grain examina-tion in the general discussion.We took as the dependent variables the dis-crimination index d', and then unpartitioned andremember-know proportions in each experi-mental condition. Tables 1 (immediate retentioninterval), 2 (non-repeated tests), and 3 (repeatedtests) present a complete view of all data on whichsubsequent analyses are based. Yonelinas andJacoby (1995) suggested the use of a transformedknow measure [Know independent; k = k/(1±R)]to make it independent from the proportion ofremember responses. Although this is a debatablepoint (see for example, Gardiner & Richardson-Klavehn, 2000), we did carry out this analysis here,but this led to similar conclusions, and so forsimplicity these analyses are not reported.Immediate retention intervalAs expected, the difference in d' for the c-nc dis-tinction was significant in a within-subject analysisof variance, F(1, 83) = 82.69, MSe = .032, indicat-ing clearly that noncognate words were betterrecognised than the cognate ones. With regard tothe mirror effect, we analysed first the c-nc, fol-lowed by the r-k mirrors. A within-subjects ana-lysis of variance on the proportion of hits showedthat noncognate hits were superior to the cognateones, F(1, 83) = 52.59, MSe = .016. The equivalentanalysis on false alarms showed the opposite pat-tern, F(1, 83) = 21.81, MSe = .004. The same typeof analysis showed a mirror effect for theremember-know response categorisation, F(1, 83)= 40.21, MSe = .055, and F(1, 83) = 14.85, MSe =.002.

We retain this analysis for reasons ofclarity, but later we will show convergent evidencewith a different approach.Non-repeated conditionAt 3 days, the difference in d' for the c-nc dis-tinction was significant and in favour of the ncstimuli, F(1, 21) = 34.228, MSe = .028. To be brief,we again obtained a mirror effect for the c-ncstimulus class for hits, F(1, 21) = 24.324, MSe =.014, and false alarms, F(1, 21) = 10.41, MSe = .032,but the remember-know mirror became non-sig-nificant due to the hit side of the pattern of effects.Statistically, F(1, 21) < 1, MSe = .026, ns, for hits(with means in the opposite direction, 0.25 vs.0.29), and false alarms, F(1, 21) = 6.24, MSe = .005,p < .05.At 7 days, noncognates were more discrimin-able than cognates, F(1, 17) = 17.36, MSe = .237.The c-nc mirror followed a pattern similar to thatof the immediate condition, although the falsealarm rate failed to reach significance. However,now the r-k mirror disappeared because the hitside showed a reversed pattern. Noncognate hitswere superior to cognates, F(1, 18) = 15.17, MSe =.013, and the opposite was true for false alarms,F(1, 18) = 5.38, MSe = .006, p < .05. However, ther-k pattern was reversed on the hit side, F(1, 18) =10.334, MSe = .015, but not for false alarms,F(1, 18) = 15.84, MSe = .007.Repeated conditionThe pattern of the repeated condition at 3 dayswas identical to that of the immediate test. Briefly,noncognates were significantly better dis-criminated, F(1, 24) = 45.235, MSe = .207. The nc-cmirror was present: for hits, F(1, 24) = 23.72, MSe= .018, and false alarms, F(1, 24) = 21.42, MSe =.003, as was the r-k mirror: for hits, F(1, 24) = 7.72,MSe = .061, and false alarms, F(1, 24) = 5.07, MSe= .005, p < .05.At 7 days, noncognates were more discrimin-able than cognates, F(1, 17) = 17.36, MSe = .237.The c-nc mirror followed the same pattern as inthe non-repeated condition described earlier: ford', F(1, 17) = 17.36, MSe = .237, and noncognatehits, F(1, 17) = 13.78, MSe = .015, and false alarms,F(1, 17) = 1.54, MSe = .016, ns; for r-k, hits, F(1, 17)< 1, MSe = .025, ns, and false alarms, F(1, 17) =4.026, MSe = .01, p = .061.As we indicated previously, the presence of ther-k mirror was verified by an analysis of varianceon a variable with dependent levels. An alter-native way of reaching the same conclusion is toanalyse separately the effect of delay on hits orfalse alarms for remember and for know for allconditions (repeated and non-repeated). Theanalysis should show an effect on remember hits,F(2, 165) = 32.95, MSe = .032, but not on knowhits, F(1, 80) < 1, MSe = .027, ns, and the usualpattern in false alarms for remember, F(1, 80) =6.41, MSe = .004, and for know, F(2, 165) = 22.99,MSe = .006. There is an additional prediction thatcan be made from some of the two factor models(Reder et al., 2000, pp. 296±297); a superior knowresponse level for both old and new responsesbecause their level of familiarity is higher in bothcases. In the present experiment, only on theimmediate test did the prediction hold; for hits,F(2, 165) = 7.92, MSe = .014, and for false alarms,F(2, 165) = 2.96, MSe = .005, p = .05. This is con-sistent with the presence of the r-k mirror effectonly at the immediate retention interval.Conditional item analysisBefore doing a conditional item analysis, weassessed the effect of repetition with the hope thatit would be as low as possible. We carried out abetween-subject analysis of variance of intervalTABLE 3Repeated testsHits False alarmsInterval NC C Total NC C Total3 Days Unpartitioned 0.85 0.66 0.76 0.10 0.20 0.15Remember 0.60 0.30 0.45 0.04 0.04 0.04Know 0.22 0.29 0.25 0.04 0.11 0.08Guess 0.03 0.07 0.05 0.02 0.04 0.03d' 2.31 1.447 Days Unpartitioned 0.76 0.58 0.67 0.25 0.33 0.29Remember 0.35 0.21 0.28 0.07 0.10 0.09Know 0.33 0.28 0.30 0.14 0.17 0.16Guess 0.08 0.09 0.09 0.04 0.06 0.05d' 1.37 0.70Mean proportions of remember and know responses to oldand new test words as a function of linguistic status (non-cognates, NC, and cognates, C), retention interval (3 days, 7days) for repeated tests (3 and 7 days later). The values for dis-crimination indices are also shown by interval and repetition.THE MIRROR EFFECT 83Downloaded by [University of Valencia] at 03:45 28 May 2015 (3±7 days) and repetition condition (repeated-nonrepeated). Although there was an effect forretention interval that is of little interest here, wefound a repetition effect for the hits proportions,F(1, 17) = 18.48, MSe = .026, but not for falsealarms, F(1, 80) = 1.25, MSe = .015, ns. Theinteractions were not significant for hits, F(1, 80) <1, MSe = .026, or for false alarms, F(1, 80) = 1.65,MSe = .015, ns.Table 4 presents the fates of the differentcategories of responses from the immediate test toeither 3 or 7 days.1 The scores represent the pro-portions of items over the total number ofresponses (R+K+M+G) that begin in one state andstay in the same one or change to a different one.The point that we want to make here is that thenumber of responses shifting from remember toknow is greater than the number shifting fromknow to remember. The statistical analysis sup-ports this statement, F(1, 44) = 8.81, MSe = .007.Moreover, this result is independent of the start-ing level of r or k responses because, at the sametime, the proportion of responses going fromknow or remember to misses is more or less equal,F(1, 44) < 1, MSe = .004, ns. Finally, there is amarginally significant interaction, indicating thatthe proportion of changes is greater for non-cognates than for cognates, F(1, 41) = 3.09, MSe =.01, p = .08.DISCUSSIONThe current experiment shows a very clear mirroreffect for the c-nc stimulus class for all retentionintervals, together with a general trend towards adecrease in hits and an increase in false alarmsover the delay period (concentring; Glanzer et al.,1993). However, the heuristic value of thisobserved mirror finds its place in the light of twoother partitions made with the same data. If wetake into account the cognate-noncognate divisionindependently for remember and know, we seethat there is no mirror for these two new slices ofdata for opposite reasons. Whereas the hitadvantage for noncognates is present in theremember part, the false alarm advantage for1 As indicated in the introduction, Knowlton and Squire(1995, p. 706) originally carried out an item analysis with asimilar purpose. However, we would like to point out a dif-ference in the way they computed the state changes. They tookas denominator of their calculated percentages changes, thenumber of responses in the original state (10-minute test con-dition). Their results, considered as final states R (remember),K (know), and M (miss), were: state changes from Remember:35.9, 28.5, 35.8, respectively; from Know: 10.1, 28.1, 61.6,respectively; and from Miss: 4.7, 9.8, 85.5, respectively. Each ofthese series of changes adds up to 100%. In our case, thedenominator is composed of all responses in a session(R+K+M+G), and the whole session adds up to a proportion of1. We have adopted this measure because it fits our purposesbetter, and makes our proportions independent of the parti-cular number of responses of the starting state. Otherwise, andbesides the fact that our proportions are lower, the conclusionswould be similar adopting either calculation procedure.TABLE 4Immediate and second testsDelayed test3 Days 7 DaysR K M G R K M GCognatesImmediate test R 0.25 0.11 0.06 0.03 0.11 0.12 0.07 0.02K 0.04 0.14 0.08 0.02 0.08 0.12 0.12 0.04M 0.01 0.02 0.15 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.17 0.03G 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.03NoncognatesR 0.50 0.13 0.07 0.02 0.27 0.15 0.08 0.04K 0.09 0.07 0.02 0.01 0.07 0.06 0.06 0.03M 0.01 0.02 0.05 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.08 0.01G 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.01Mean proportion of changes over the total number of responses in a session, among response states (M =miss, R = remember, K = know, G = guess) from the immediate test to the second test taking place at 3 or 7 days.84 ALGARABEL, PITARQUE, GOTORDownloaded by [University of Valencia] at 03:45 28 May 2015 cognates is present in the know slice of the data.This dissociation of the data, according to thesubjective response categorisation, is clear evi-dence in favour of the distinct weights of therecollection and familiarity processes and, on theother hand, of the validity in this context of theremember-know procedure.The results are more valuable in light of thedisappearance of the remember-know mirror at 3-and 7-day delays. The reason is very obvious, andit is easily observed in Table 1. It is the change inthe balance between the remember and knowproportions that is producing this dissociation.Whereas the predominance of remember respon-ses in the noncognate class persists at all retentionintervals, it reverses when one looks at theremember-know mirror. Presumably, and there isvery strong evidence in its favour, it is the balancebetween recollection and familiarity that is pro-ducing this shift in the pattern of data. The finalitem analysis supports this view in line with theidea that item and context information are inde-pendent sources of information, at least within thepresent experimental conditions. Forgetting con-textual information causes a remember responseto become a know response. This is also the reasonwhy sometimes (Gardiner & Java, 1991) forget-ting may not seem to affect know responses. Wethink that part of the loss in know responses iscompensated by previous remember responsesthat became know responses due to loss of con-textual information. We hoped to have had a smallor nonexistent repetition effect in order toobserve an accurate estimation of the remember-to-know transfer, but this turned out to beunfounded. Therefore, there is an under-estimation of the real r>k transfer, given thatrepetition affected only the remember hit rate.Many previous authors have pointed out thedifficulty or impossibility of completely rejecting atheory based on an isolated set of data. However,these results have a very natural interpretationbased on the two-factor theories (Joordens &Hockley, 2000; Reder et al., 2000), which appeal tothe interplay of recollection and familiarity as theunderlying cause of the experimental evidencedescribed in the literature and, particularly, of thedissociations implying the mirror effect.Manuscript received 20 January 2004Manuscript accepted 22 November 2004PrEview proof published online 5 April 2005REFERENCESAlameda, J.
