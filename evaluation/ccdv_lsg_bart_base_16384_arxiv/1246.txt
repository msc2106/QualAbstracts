© 2016 Acoustical Society of America. Beamformers enable a microphone array to capture acoustic signals from a sound source with high signal to noise ratio in a noisy environment, and the linear microphone array is of particular importance, in practice, due to its simplicity and easy implementation. A linear microphone array sometimes is used near some scattering objects, which affect its beamforming performance. This paper develops a numerical model with a linear microphone array near a rigid sphere for both far-field plane wave and near-field sources. The effects of the scatterer on two typical beamformers, i.e., the delay-and-sum beamformer and the superdirective beamformer, are investigated by both simulations and experiments. It is found that the directivity factor of both beamformers improves due to the increased equivalent array aperture when the size of the array is no larger than that of the scatter. With the increase of the array size, the directivity factor tends to deteriorate at high frequencies because of the rising side-lobes. When the array size is significantly larger than that of the scatterer, the scattering has hardly any influence on the beamforming performance.

INTRODUCTIONMicrophone arrays have been widely studied in speechcommunication applications, such as hands-free telephony,hearing aids, speech recognition, and enhancement.1–3 Abasic function of microphone arrays is the beamformer,which is designed to capture desired signals from the so-called look direction and suppress the interference from allthe other directions. Various array configurations have beenused for the beamformers design.4–6 Among them, linearmicrophone arrays are widely used and studied due to itssimplicity and easy implementation.Conventional approaches for designing beamformersusually assume ideal or known microphone characteristics.4,7However, these beamformers are sensitive to the errors inmicrophone characteristics.8 To combat this problem, sev-eral robust beamformer design approaches have been pro-posed in recent years.8–14 In Refs. 8–10, robustness isimproved by optimizing the mean performance, where theprobability density function of microphone characteristics istaken into consideration. Another popular approach is basedon the minimax design criterion with the worst-case perfor-mance optimization.11–13 The white noise gain constraintapproach is also widely used in robust superdirective beam-formers design.9,14Most commonly used robust design approaches onlyconsider the random errors in the microphone array charac-teristics. However, the non-ideal acoustic field inevitablyinfluences the beamformer performance, which is of signifi-cance to be investigated. In this paper, deviations caused bythe scattering from a near-field scatterer are of particularinterest. Acoustic scattering of a near-field human head havebeen considered in head mounted arrays, such as hearingaids, headsets and helmets.15–17 Using a uniform circulararray mounted on a rigid sphere, the scattering effect by therigid sphere can be utilized to design beamformers with nar-rower beamwidth and higher directivity factor (DF).18,19However, the influence of the near-field scatterer on the per-formance of the linear microphone array beamformers hasyet to be analyzed.In this paper, a near-field scattering model is established,where the near-field scatterer is assumed as a rigid sphere.Both the far-field plane wave model and the near-field pointsource model are used in the analysis. Furthermore, a reason-able analytical model considering the scattering of the speakeris utilized. The time domain simulation is used to analyze theinfluence of the scattering on the wave propagation, and thenthe influence of the near-field scatterer on the performance oftwo typical beamformers, i.e., the delay-and-sum (DS) andthe superdirective beamformers,1 are investigated. The DF ofarrays under four different configurations with and withoutthe scattering are compared, and some meaningful featurestogether with the physical explanations are presented. Theexperiments using arrays and rigid spheres under these differ-ent configurations further validate the features.II.

Far-field sound source model with a scattererWhen the sound source is far from the array, the inci-dent wave is usually assumed as plane waves as depicted inFigs. 1(a) and 1(b). In spherical coordinates, the incidentplane wave can be expressed as21piðr; hÞ ¼ p0ejkr cos h¼ p0X1l¼0ðjÞlð2lþ 1ÞjlðkrÞPlðcos hÞ; (1)where j¼ (1)1/2, p0 is the amplitude of the incident wave, kis the wave number, jl() is the spherical Bessel function oforder l, and Pl() is the Legendre function of order l.The total sound field with consideration of the rigidsphere scattering can be expressed as21,22ptot r; hð Þ ¼ p0X1l¼0jð Þl 2lþ 1ð Þ jl krð Þ j0l kað Þh0l kað Þhl krð Þ" #Pl cos hð Þ; (2)where a is the radius of the rigid sphere, hl() is the sphericalHankel function of order l, j0lðÞ, and h0lðÞ are the derivativesof the spherical Bessel and Hankel function, respectively.For the far-field plane wave, the sound pressure at eachmicrophone can be calculated by Eq. (2), then the perfor-mance of different beamforming algorithms with plane waveassumption under the influence of the scattering can besimulated.B. Point source model with a scattererWhen the sound source is located at the near-field regionof the array, the plane wave assumption is no longer validand the point source model is used.4 In spherical coordinates,the sound pressure at location re¼ (re, he, ue) generated by apoint source located at rc¼ (rc, hc, uc) can be expanded interms of spherical harmonics21pi reð Þ ¼ jxq0qejkr4pr¼ kxq0qX1l¼0jl kr<ð Þhl kr>ð ÞXlm¼lYlm hc;ucð ÞYlm he;ueð Þ; (3)where x is the angular frequency, q0 is the mean air density,q is the volume velocity of the source, r¼ jrercj, Ylm is thespherical harmonic of order l and degree m, r<¼min(jrej,jrcj) and r>¼max(jrej,jrcj).

A speaker model with a scattererConsidering that the microphone array is usually used tocapture the voice of a speaker, a proper speaker modelinstead of the point source will lead to a more reasonablenear-field model. In this paper, an analytical speaker model,in which the speaker’s head is represented by a rigid sphereand the speaker’s mouth is represented by a radially vibrat-ing piston mounted on the surface of the rigid sphere,21 isutilized. The basic schematic diagram of the speaker modeltogether with the rigid sphere scatterer is shown in Fig. 1(c).Two spherical coordinate systems are used in this diagram,referred to as O1 and O2, respectively. A receiver point islocated at r1¼ (r1, h1, u1) in the coordinate system O1 or atr2¼ (r2, h2, u2) in the coordinate system O2. The XZ planesof both coordinate systems are located within the same planeand in the same axial directions, and therefore u1¼u2.The speaker source is modeled as a rigid sphere ofradius b, and the mouth is modeled as a piston of radiusb sin h0 located on the surface of a rigid sphere. To simplifythe simulations, the mouth of the human head is assumed toface the center of the microphone array, as depicted in Fig.1(d). The amplitude of the surface velocity of the humanhead sphere is assumed asUðh;uÞ ¼u0; 0  h  h0; 0  u < 2p0; h0  h  p; 0  u < 2p:(5)The velocity distribution can be expanded in terms of spheri-cal harmonics as23Uðh;uÞ ¼X1l¼0Xlm¼lUlmYlmðh;uÞ: (6)The spherical harmonic coefficients are given byUlm¼u02ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi4p2lþ1rP0l1 cosh0ð ÞP0lþ1 cosh0ð Þh i; m¼00; m 6¼0;8><>:(7)where Pml ðÞ is the associated Legendre function of degreel and order m, and for l¼ 0, P01ðxÞ ¼ 1.

After that, the coefficients C0lmand D0lm in Eq. (12) can be obtained, and the sound pressureat each microphone can be calculated by Eq. (11). Then theperformance of different beamforming algorithms with thespeaker source model under the influence of the scatteringcan be simulated.Apart from the commonly used array patterns, the DF isalso utilized in this paper to numerically assess the directiv-ity performance of the microphone array beamformers,which is defined as9DF kð Þ ¼ 10 log10jH k; hl;ulð Þj214pð2p0ðp0jH k; h;uð Þj2 sin hdhdu0B@1CA;(20)where (hl, ul) is the look direction of the beamformer andH(k, h, u) is the array response.III. SIMULATIONSIn this section, the effects of a near-field scatterer on theperformance of linear microphone array beamformers arepresented with numerical simulations on two typical beam-formers, i.e., the DS and the superdirective beamformers.The DS beamformer has the benefit of the maximum robust-ness,1 while the superdirective beamformer has the benefit ofthe maximum directivity.9,14 Geometrical arrangements ofthe sound source, the rigid sphere and the microphone arrayare shown in Fig. 1. A diagonal loading factor of e¼ 0.001 isused for the robust superdirective beamformer design.14 Inthe following simulations, the microphone array is placed inthe x axis with the center being the origin of the coordinatesystem.A. Beamformers with the far-field plane wavescattering modelFigure 2 depicts the time response of the plane wavescattering from a rigid sphere and shows what happens whena short plane wave pulse impinges on a rigid sphere, usingsimilar calculation method as described in Ref. 20. The planewave incident from the direction of z> 0. Nine frames of thetime response are listed sequentially from top left to bottomright. In each frame, the total sound field is calculated overan area of x 2 [0.3 0.3] m and z 2 [0.1 0.5] m. The centerof the rigid sphere is located at [0 0 0.3] m. In the timedomain simulation, the radius of the rigid sphere a is 0.1 m,the sampling frequency is 12.8 kHz, and the time incrementbetween each frame is three sampling intervals. It can beseen that the wavefront is delayed due to the influence of thescattering and the delay is mainly manifested in the area of x2 [0.15 0.15] m and z 2 [0.1 0.2] m, i.e., the rear side ofthe rigid sphere. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate thatthe scatterer at the look direction of the array has the mostinfluence on the beamforming performance. In the followingsimulations, the rigid sphere is placed in the broadside direc-tion, i.e., hs¼ 90, with a distance of 0.3 m between the cen-ter of the rigid sphere and the center of the array.J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 140 (2), August 2016 Hu et al. 927Figure 3 depicts the normalized array patterns with andwithout consideration of the rigid sphere scattering at 1.0and 3.5 kHz. In this simulation, a five-element linear micro-phone array with element spacing d¼ 4 cm is used, and theradius of the sphere is 10 cm. The results indicate that thebeamwidth of both the DS and the superdirective beamform-ers becomes narrower when the rigid sphere scattering isconsidered. Because of the diffraction effect, the transmis-sion time between the signal source and the microphonelocated at the rear side of the rigid sphere is increased asdepicted in Fig. 2. This increases the phase differencesbetween microphones, and leads to the increase of the effec-tive element spacing and the effective aperture of the array.Therefore the beamwidth of the beamformer becomes nar-rower. Note that similar phenomenon has been noticed formicrophone array mounted on a rigid sphere.18,19Figure 4 depicts the normalized array patterns with thebeamformers steered to the direction of h¼ 60. It can beseen that the scatterer has little influence on the performanceof the beamformer when the array is steered away from therigid sphere. Therefore, in the following simulations, thebeamformer is designed with broadside look direction.Figure 5 depicts the DF of the far-field DS and superdir-ective beamformers with and without consideration of therigid sphere scattering for different microphone number M,element spacing d and rigid sphere radius a. It can be seenthat when the size of the microphone array is no larger thanthat of the rigid sphere, the DF of both the DS and the super-directive beamformers becomes higher, as depicted in Figs.5(a)–5(b). When a plane wave is scattered by a rigid sphere,the sound energy is concentrated in the direction of the inci-dent wave.22 This increases the sound pressure received bythe microphones at the broadside direction for small-sizedarrays, leading to a higher DF. When the size of the micro-phone array is close to that of the rigid sphere, the increasedequivalent array aperture will lead to a narrower beamwidthand a higher DF, similar to the feature of the microphonearray mounted on a rigid sphere.18,19 When the size of thearray is significantly larger than that of the rigid sphere, rigidsphere scattering only influences a small part of the micro-phone array and there is hardly any variation of the DF, asdepicted in Fig. 5(d).An interesting phenomenon that should be noted in Fig.5(c) is that the DF deteriorates under the influence of scatter-ing. This is mainly caused by the increased side-lobe level.Although putting the sphere in the look direction of thebeamformers causes the beamwidth to become narrower, italso cause some degradation to the side-lobe levels, similarto the circular array mounted on the rigid sphere.18 When thesignal incidents from the main-lobe direction, the micro-phone array is located at the rear side of the rigid sphere, i.e.,the shadow region as depicted in Fig. 6(a), and the beam-width of the beamformer becomes narrower because of theincreased equivalent array aperture. When signal incidentsFIG. 2. (Color online) Time responseof the plane wave scattering from arigid sphere.928 J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 140 (2), August 2016 Hu et al.from the side-lobe direction, most of the microphone ele-ments will no longer be in the shadow region if the size ofthe microphone array is no larger than that of the rigidsphere, as depicted in Fig. 6(b). Therefore the increment ofthe side-lobe level is limited. However, when the size of thearray is larger than that of the rigid sphere, the microphonearray will be influenced by the shadow region when thesignal incidents from the side-lobe direction, as depicted inFIG. 3.

Am. 140 (2), August 2016 Hu et al. 929Fig. 6(b). The corresponding side-lobes would arise muchhigher at high frequencies and the DF of the correspondingbeamformers becomes lower as depicted in Fig. 5(c).B. Near-field beamformers with the point sourcescattering modelIn the near-field beamformer simulation, the distancebetween the sound source and the center of the array is keptat 0.6 m. Figure 7 depicts the DF of the near-field DS andsuperdirective beamformers with and without considerationof the rigid sphere scattering. For the near-field situation, thesound energy of the point source is also concentrated in thedirection of the incident wave after rigid sphere scattering.22Meanwhile, because of the diffraction around the rigidsphere, the transmission time between the point source andthe microphone at the rear side of the rigid sphere is alsoincreased.20 Therefore, the DF of both the DS and the super-directive beamformers becomes higher, when the size of themicrophone array is no larger than that of the rigid sphere, asdepicted in Figs. 7(a)–7(b).Similar to the far-field situations, the beamformers suf-fer from the increased side-lobe level, when the size of thearray is larger than that of the rigid sphere. The DF of thecorresponding beamformers becomes lower at high frequen-cies as depicted in Fig. 7(c), where it can also be seen thatthe DF tends to decrease at high frequencies under the influ-ence of scattering. Under the point source assumption, therigid sphere scattering influences the sound field more evi-dently than that under the plane wave assumption.20 The cor-responding side-lobe levels under the point source scenariotend to be higher at high frequencies. As a result, the corre-sponding DF decreases at high frequencies as depicted inFig. 7(c). When the size of the array is significantly largerthan that of the rigid sphere, there is hardly any variation ofthe DF, as depicted in Fig. 7(d).C. Near-field beamformers with the speaker scatteringmodelIn this simulations, the sound source is assumed to be aspeaker model, the radius of the speaker is b¼ 0.1 m, l0 is1.0 m/s and h0 is 13.2. The distance between the mouth andthe center of the array is kept at 0.6 m. Figure 8 depicts theDF of the near-field DS and superdirective beamformer withand without consideration of rigid sphere scattering. Similarto the near-field situation with the point source, the DF ofboth the near-field beamformers becomes higher when thesize of the microphone array is no larger than that of theFIG. 5.

When the size of the microphone array is largerthan that of the rigid sphere, the corresponding DF tends todecrease at high frequencies and becomes lower than thatwithout rigid sphere scattering. When the size of the micro-phone array is significantly larger than the rigid sphere, thereis hardly any variance of the DF. Furthermore, when com-pared with Fig. 7, it can be found that the DF is nearly thesame as those with a point source model. This indicates thatthe physical model of the sound source has little influence onthe performance of the beamformer.FIG. 7.

Am. 140 (2), August 2016 Hu et al. 931From the above simulations, it can be concluded that theDF of the beamformers becomes higher, when the size of themicrophone array is no larger than that of the rigid sphere.However, the drastic increment of the side-lobe level causedby the scattering leads to a lower DF of the beamformerswhen the size of the microphone array becomes larger.When the size of the array is significantly larger than that ofthe rigid sphere, the scattering only affects a small part ofthe microphone array and there is hardly any variation of theDF. It should be noted that although not shown in this paper,the same conclusions can be obtained when the beamformersare steered to other directions as long as the rigid sphere isplaced in the look direction.IV. EXPERIMENTSThe experiments were carried out in an anechoic cham-ber as shown in Fig. 9. Two uniform linear microphone arraysconsisting of 10 MEMS microphones with element spacing 4and 0.8 cm were used. Two removable rigid spheres with radiiof 10 and 5 cm, respectively, were placed in the broadsidedirection of the array and rotated with the array synchro-nously. The distance between the center of the sphere and themicrophone array is 0.3 m. By fixing the position of thesource and rotating the linear array around the center axis ofthe turntable, signals from different directions were recordedusing an NI PXIe-4497 multi-channel measurement systemwith 16 kHz sampling frequency and 24 bit sampling preci-sion. As shown in Sec. III that similar beamformer variationis expected under different source model, only far-field sourcewas used in the experiments.Figure 10 depicts the normalized array pattern for thefar-field DS and superdirective beamformers with M¼ 5,d¼ 0.8 cm, and a¼ 10 cm at 1.0 and 3.5 kHz. It can be seenthat the beamwidth becomes significantly narrower when therigid sphere is placed in the look direction of the beamform-ers. This coincides with the theoretical analysis since thearray size is smaller than the size of the sphere. The directiv-ity of the DS beamformer without consideration of the rigidsphere scattering at 3.5 kHz seems a little abnormal. This ismainly caused by the directivity of the MEMS microphoneFIG. 9.

As expectedfrom the simulation, the beamwidth is still narrower underthe influence of the near-field scatterer when the array size isclose to that of the sphere.Figure 12 depicts the normalized array pattern for thefar-field DS and superdirective beamformers with M¼ 10,FIG. 11.

However, the correspond-ing side-lobes of the beamformers become much higher, andthis will lead to a lower DF.Figure 13 depicts the normalized array pattern for the far-field DS and superdirective beamformers with M¼ 10,d¼ 4 cm, and a¼ 5 cm at 1.0 and 3.5 kHz. When the arraysize is significantly larger than that of the rigid sphere, there ishardly any influence on the array pattern of the beamformers.This meets the expectations from the theoretical analysis.V. CONCLUSIONSThis paper investigates the influence of a near-field scat-terer on the performance of a linear microphone array beam-former. The numerical models are established based on arigid sphere scatterer and three different source models, i.e.,the far-field plane wave, the near-field point source, and thenear-field speaker model. From simulation results with twotypical beamformers, the delay-and-sum and the superdirec-tive beamformers, it can be found that the directivity factorof the beamformer becomes better when the array size is nolarger than the size of the scatterer. This is a beneficial fea-ture useful in designing small array with high directivity.When the array size is larger than that of the rigid sphere,the directivity factor drops down at high frequencies due tothe rising side-lobes. However, when the array size is muchlarger than that of the rigid sphere, there is hardly any varia-tion of the beamforming performance since the scatteringonly influence a small part of the array. Experiments in theanechoic chamber validate these remarks.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by National Science Foundationof China Grant No. 11374156.1M. Brandstein and D.
