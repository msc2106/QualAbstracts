  1The strategically located land index support system for human settlements land reform 1 in South Africa 2 3 4 Creating sustainable human settlements is fundamental in fostering spatial and socio-economic 5 integration in South Africa. Policy makers are often faced with the problem of identifying strategically 6 located land for human settlements land reform in South Africa. To date there is no tool or standard 7 framework that assists the government to identify land that is strategically located for land reform.

The quality and aesthetics of housing as well as its proximity to other related urban 24 amenities such as schools, road networks, places of worship and open spaces, and economic 25 opportunities form the bedrock of sustainable human settlements. In building houses, land 26 becomes ‘an up-front component’ (Huchzermeyer, 2003, Harrison, Huchzermeyer, & 27 Mayekiso, 2003). The availability and accessibility of land as well as its proximity or distance 28 from other supporting physical, social and environmental infrastructure determines both the 29 functionality as well as the desirability of cities. 30 31 In South Africa, the colonial and apartheid spatial planning practices deliberately created cities, 32 towns and homelands (Bantustans) fragmented on racial and ethnic lines (Harrison, 33 Huchzermeyer, & Mayekiso, 2003). The Natives Land Act No. 27 of 1913 and the Group Areas 34 Act 41 of 1950 prohibited Africans from purchasing or leasing land outside the homelands. As 35 a result, Africans were located in townships and hostels far removed from urban amenities such 36 as water, electricity, schools and places of entertainment. The so-called ‘white cities’ (i.e. 37 where white people resided) were well positioned spatially, and well serviced with amenities 38 needed for a fulfilled urban life. The fact that black townships were located far from areas with 39 economic potential rendered them not strategically located from a service delivery point of 40 view. Consequently, the current urban and housing challenges in South Africa have its roots in 41 the history of land dispossession and segregatory policies. Williams (2000) therefore argues 42 that the cumulative impact of these racially contrived planning frameworks resulted in South 43 Africa having “Islands of Spatial Affluence” in a “Sea of Geographical Misery. Therefore, 44 there is a strong need to identify land that is strategically located to ensure spatial and social 45 integration. 46 South Africa’s skewed land ownership patterns are further complicated by the global and local 47 calls for sustainable environmental planning (World Commission of Environment and 48 Development, 1986). The realities of climate change and the subsequent threats to food security 49 and development at large, requires the state and its developmental partners to preserve natural 50 2capital. South Africa therefore finds itself in a space where demands for social justice at times 51 compete with international obligations for protecting environmental assets. Balancing the 52 relationship between poverty, inequitable access to resources, land reform and the protection 53 of biodiversity, remains a challenge to the South African government (Crane, 2006). The 54 creation of biodiversity and mega-reserves on one hand, and the demands for developments in 55 the built environment requires a scientific approach that can assist the state to ascertain the 56 best-possible land for these competing activities (Ramutsindela, 2003). Hence, the significance 57 of a geographic multi-criteria approach to land identification proposed herein. 58 59 A number of frameworks and legislations to support government developmental strategies 60 including land restitution and redistribution were introduced since the dawn of democracy in 61 1994 (Kepe & Tessaro, 2014). To accelerate the rate of land redistribution and restitution in 62 South Africa, the South African government seeks to follow a structured approach to land 63 acquisition. Cabinet decided in 2009 to implement the Comprehensive Rural Development 64 Programme (CRDP), and use it as a blueprint for land development and use. It was determined 65 that quality of land and its location are critical when acquiring land. Sector departments such 66 as, The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) does not have a 67 guideline or framework that clearly outlines what land is referred to as “strategically located” 68 for establishing human settlements. Likewise, The Minister in the then Department of Land 69 Affairs noted that at least 50 per cent of government land reform projects have failed to make 70 their beneficiaries permanently better off (Centre for Development and Enterprise (CDE), 71 2008). Furthermore, the land reform had a rural bias without making a significant impact in 72 improving spatial integration in urban areas. Moreover, according to the National Development 73 Plan, there is a strong desire to create smart and sustainable human settlements. Similarly, some 74 land acquisitions where people have resettled have been un-strategic as there are little amenities 75 present (Bradstock, 2006). Identifying this strategically located land is more than formal, 76 nominal or constitutional validity (Williams, 2000). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to 77 propose a Strategically Located Land Index (SLLI) using Geographic Information Systems 78 (GIS) and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). This provides a powerful and smart 79 spatial decision support system that makes it possible to identify land that is strategically 80 located for human settlements land reform. 81 82 The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: a look into the state of Geographic 83 Information Systems and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) in spatial decision 84 support systems for land suitability followed by the methods, results and discussion on the 85 usefulness of the SLLI. 86 87 2 GIS-MCDA IN SPATIAL PLANNING 88 Various methods to identify land suitable for establishing smart human settlements exist. These 89 tools are even more useful in the 21st century where there are global problems such as climate 90 change, sustainable development, urbanisation and land reform in the developing world. 91 Numerous studies show that the lack of carrying out of land suitability analysis especially for 92 human settlements can result in degradable land and settlements not being smart (La Rosa et 93 al., 2014; Malczewski, 2006b; Pinto-Correia & Carvalho-Ribeiro, 2012; Puertas, Henríquez, 94 & Meza, 2014; Thapa & Murayama, 2008; Zhou, 2015). Using land unsuitable for such use 95 results in negative environmental costs (Lui et al., 2014). Assessing land suitability is crucial 96 as every portion of the landscape is characterised by a different set of features that render it 97 more suitable for certain uses than other uses (Heacock & Hollander, 2011; Kliskey, 2000; 98 Marull et al., 2007; Park et al., 2011; Pourebrahim, Hadipour, & Mokhtar, 2011). 99 100 3Urban Planners have leveraged the use of GIS-MCDA in identifying land that is suitable to 101 establish communities and urban amenities (Hamzeh et al., 2015; Jelokhani-Niaraki & 102 Malczewski, 2015; Malczewski, 2006b). It is essential to combine GIS and MCDA in 103 developing Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS). Conventional MCDA techniques are 104 often non-spatial and assume that the area under analysis is spatially uniform. Consequently, 105 this makes MCDA unsuitable for spatial analysis and thus it is not suitable for urban planning. 106 Despite MCDA’s potential to be integrated into solving urban planning problems related to 107 spatial entities, multi-criteria decision analysis remained in operational research and 108 management fields for a substantial period of time as decision support systems (Phua & 109 Minowa, 2005). It is only recently (last two decades 1990’s and 2000’s) as a result of improved 110 technological capabilities that MCDA has addressed spatial problems. 111 112 Similarly, GIS technology is inadequate in decision-making capabilities (Malczewski, 1999; 113 2003). It cannot fully address complexities associated with resource management issues such 114 as identifying strategic land for human settlements land reform (Laskar, 2003). Moreover GIS 115 has limitations in representing judgements, values, arguments, combining the decision maker’s 116 preferences and heuristics into the problem-solving process (Jelokhani-Niaraki & Malczewski, 117 2015; Malczewski, 1999, 2006a, 2006b; Malczewski, 2006b). However, GIS remains a useful 118 tool for handling physical suitability analysis. Consequently, there is need of combining GIS 119 with other approaches used during land suitability analysis to create smart human settlements. 120 121 Concerning the specific literature on MCDA, a Scopus search returned 1286 articles whereas 122 when limited to GIS-MCDA 39 articles were found (Figure 1). There has been a significant 123 increase in the GIS-MCDA research since 1996 as a result of advances in the field of GIS and 124 MCDA, which makes integration possible. Integration frameworks combine GIS capabilities 125 of data acquisition, storage, retrieval, manipulation and analysis and the capabilities of MCDA 126 techniques for aggregating geographical data (spatial) data and the decision maker’s 127 preferences into a one-dimensional value to make a decision (Hamzeh et al., 2015; Jelokhani-128 Niaraki & Malczewski, 2015; Pourebrahim et al., 2011). Combining MCDA and GIS 129 techniques reduces complexity in the decision-making process. Effective multi-criteria 130 decision analysis in solving complex problems such as land reform is only possible with input 131 from GIS analysts, decision makers, and professionals in the spatial planning domain (Van 132 Niekerk, 2008). 133 134 [Insert Figure 1 here] 135 136 The increase in the volume of GIS-MCDA research can also be attributed to a number of 137 reasons. According to (Malczewski, 2006a), this was because of, first, a wider recognition of 138 decision analysis and support as an essential element of GI science initiatives on ‘Spatial 139 Decision Support Systems (SDSS)’, secondly the availability of low-cost and easy-to-use 140 MCDA software and mathematical programming techniques and thirdly, the proliferation and 141 availability of MCDA modules in such systems as IDRISI (Eastman et al. 1993). 142 143 Studies in which spatial decision support systems technology has been used for land 144 management are well documented in the literature. Arnold et al. (2000) designed specific tools 145 to address urban sprawl. These tools were designed to understand what effect land use change 146 has on water quality. Sanders and Tabuchi (2000) provided local planners in the United 147 Kingdom with an SDSS to analyse flood risk. Some spatial decision systems have been 148 developed as standalone programs, while others are solely web-based. These include the ‘What 149 4If?’ system (Klosterman, 2008) and the Wide Bay-Burnet Regional Information System 150 (WBBRIS) respectively (Pettit, Shy & Stimson, 2002). Petit et al., (2015) extended the ‘What 151 If?’ as an online tool that can be used for scenario building as well as a tool for walkability 152 analysis in neighbourhoods for Australian cities. Other systems have been developed mainly 153 to visualise potential spatial developments. Such systems include GAME and Key to Virtual 154 Insight (K2vi) (Geertman & Stillwell, 2004). GAME was developed to evaluate plan-based 155 scenarios on land development in New Jersey USA, whereas K2vi allows users to manipulate 156 and analyse two-dimensional and three-dimensional data within a virtual reality environment 157 to assist in sustainable urban design in Auckland, New Zealand. Likewise, Abdullahi et al 158 (2015) designed a GIS-MCDA to evaluate mixed land use development for a compact city in 159 Malaysia. Van Niekerk et al., (2016) used GIS-MCDA to develop a planning support system 160 to model growth potential in towns of the Western Cape province in South, Africa. Despite the 161 proliferation of GIS-MCDA tools in land suitability there are limited GIS-MCDA studies and 162 tools that have been explicitly developed to support and inform decisions regarding land 163 reform. Although esteemed institutes such as the Gauteng City Region Observatory (GCRO) 164 and African Centre for Cities (ACC) in South Africa have GIS systems, they hardly do focus 165 on land suitability and urban land reform in particular. Notwithstanding this, the GCRO, ACC 166 and Todes et al., (2015) are instrumental in stimulating robust debate in urban policy issues. 167 168 3 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 169 This section provides a step-by-step approach on how the SLLI for human settlements land 170 reform in South Africa was developed. Identifying land suitable for land reform is a complex 171 process. The approach taken to develop the SLLI involves using GIS-MCDA. A consultative, 172 participatory, anticipatory and collaborative approach was employed to improve user 173 acceptance within the DRDLR (Figure 2). The process involved criteria identification, criteria 174 weighting, mapping and assigning rule sets and generating the strategically located index. The 175 mapping, assigning of rule sets and computing of the SLLI was done using ArcGIS 10.2 and 176 the model builder tool in ArcGIS 10.2 177 178 [Insert Figure 2 here] 179 180 3.1 CRITERIA IDENTIFICATION 181 Criteria identification for identifying strategically located land was carried out through 182 participatory planning workshops (Figure 2). An initial workshop was conducted in September 183 2013, which consisted of professionals in government departments, consultants, and policy 184 makers. Most of these were officials from various sector departments such as DRDLR, 185 Economic Development, Human Settlements, Agriculture and Cooperative Governance and 186 Traditional Affairs. Selection of the criteria was guided mainly by national legislation and 187 policy documents such as the National Development Plan. The workshop resulted in criteria 188 which were grouped into seven broad themes namely proximity to Economic Development 189 Corridors (EDCs), proximity to Strategic Infrastructure Projects (SIP), proximity to 190 infrastructure, linkages to social amenities and markets, land with unique resources features 191 that provide a competitive advantage, vital infrastructure for social and economic development. 192 These themes produced over 60 criteria, which would make it impossible and complex to 193 develop a GIS tool. Accordingly, a core team comprising academic experts in GIS and town 194 planning, professionals such as Town Planners, GIS professionals, Environmentalists, built 195 environment professionals, Agronomists, Economists from various government departments 196 together with civil society were appointed to streamline the criteria. Literature and human 197 settlement guidelines were also consulted extensively in criteria selection (Bradstock, 2006; 198 5Jelokhani-Niaraki & Malczewski, 2015; Marquet & Miralles-Guasch, 2015; Marull et al., 199 2007; UNHABITAT, 2010; Van Niekerk et al., 2010). Consequently, the number of criteria 200 was reduced to 14 (Table 1) to make a well-informed decision and also to reduce complexity 201 and redundancy. Table 1 clearly shows that criteria relating to proximity have greater weight 202 because proximity dynamics have a wide array of positive outcomes which include; reduction 203 in vehicle emissions and improving the wellbeing of citizens (Marquet & Miralles-Guasch, 204 2015). Similarly, the criteria have to be logically sound and consistently relate to the objective 205 of identifying strategically located spaces for human settlements land reform. Likewise, the 206 workshop deliberations also made sure that criteria are realistic, transparent and simple (Saaty 207 1987). 208 209 [Insert Table 1 here] 210 211 3.2 CRITERIA WEIGHTING 212 During a sequel set of workshops with the core team1 participants engaged in an Group 213 Analytical Hierarchy Process (GAHP) for weighting each criterion using a pair wise 214 comparison matrix for the 14 criteria (Malczewski, 2006b; Saaty, 1987; Satty, 1980). The 215 GAHP was chosen for comparing criteria, because it is a comprehensive method of 216 multicriteria decision analysis (Malczewski & Rinner, 2015). Consequently, the pair wise 217 comparison matrix asks how important one criterion is relative to another based on a 1-9 scale 218 (Table 2). 219 220 [Insert Table 2 here] 221 222 Workshop participants were given a template with 105 pairwise comparisons of the 14 criteria 223 to complete. This template was computed using the GAHP calculator by Goepel (2014). 224 Consequently, the participants used the GAHP calculator software to create an overall 225 weighting matrix, which involves synthesizing each of the individual’s judgments and 226 combining the resulting priorities using a geometric mean (Malczewski & Rinner 2015). This 227 approach is better than the group consensus-reaching model because it relieves the group2 of 228 the need for a moderator who may be biased, through the use of an automatic feedback 229 mechanism (Dong & Cooper, 2016; Grošelj et al., 2015). The pairwise matrix had a consistency 230 ratio of 0.025, which implies that there were no logical inconsistencies in the matrix. Similarly, 231 the sum of the weight for all the criteria should add up to 1(one) to ensure consistency. 232 233 3.3 MAPPING AND ASSIGNING OF RULE SETS 234 Mapping of the 14 criteria was divided into two parts (1) data collection and geodatabase 235 development and (2) developing rule sets for the each criterion. The spatial data was collected 236 from the DRDLR, the National Geospatial Inspectorate and other government departments. 237 This data was stored into a geodatabase, which was divided into themes, namely 238 environmental/physical and socio-economic GIS layers. This data was assigned 239 Hartebeesthoek_1994 Geographic Coordinates Systems. Rule-sets for each criterion were 240 identified from literature (Durand & Gonzalez-Feliu, 2012; Fafchamps & Wahba, 2006; Leite 241 et al., 2014; Marquet & Miralles-Guasch, 2014, 2015). Accordingly, maps for each criterion 242 were classified using suitability scale of -1 to 2 were 2 is highly suitable, 1 moderately suitable, 243 1 Experts in GIS and town planning, professionals such as Town Planners, GIS professionals, Environmentalists, built environment professionals, Agronomists, Economists from various government departments together with civil society y. 2 Aggregating using an automated algorithm was utilised because it avoids using a moderator or judge who may be biased (Dong & Cooper, 2016. Moreover reaching consensus is almost impossible in the real world, hence utilising the algorithm by Goepel (2014) that ensures consistency and avoids biases. 60 marginally suitable and -1 unsuitable (Table 3). Assigning these rule sets enabled statistical 244 analysis using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) to derive the strategically located 245 index. In addition, the classification scale of -1 to 2 enables comparisons, normalisation and 246 simplifies interpretation of the results. 247 248 [Insert Table 3 here] 249 250 3.4 GENERATING THE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED INDEX 251 The WLC was chosen to calculate the (SLLI) where ௟ܵ total score of strategically located land 252 for a land unit is calculated using the following equation (1)3. 253 254 ௟ܵ ൌ ∑ ௜ܹ ௡௜ୀଵ ௜ܲ Equation 1 255 256 Where ௜ܹ of each criterion is calculated using GAHP, ௜ܲ represents value of each criterion 257 based on corresponding standards and n is the number of criterion. This approach was selected 258 because it is a risk averse and full trade off solution (Van Niekerk et al. 2016). Nevertheless, 259 when more control is required over the trade off one can apply the Ordered Weighted Average 260 (OWA) (Van Niekerk et al. 2016). 261 262 The final SLLI was a raster; however, for ease of use the SLLI values where extracted to points 263 and accompanying criteria justifying each point was attached using structured querying 264 language. The points were also converted to theisen polygons of 500m X 500m containing the 265 SLLI and accompany criteria to improve visualization. Lastly, these polygons where calibrated 266 or reclassified to improve usability using a range of 1-100 where 0-25 represents unstrategic 267 locations, 26-50 marginally strategic, 51-75 moderately strategic and 76-100 highly strategic 268 land to establish human settlements. Extensive validation and accuracy assessments were also 269 carried out to determine if the SLLI and accompanying criterion corresponds. The theisen 270 polygons where later plugged into the SLLI web viewer that mangers could use as a SDSS. 271 272 273 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 274 Figure 3 shows the strategically located land index for human settlements land reform while 275 Figure 4 shows strategic location for human settlements land reform according to strategic 276 location (suitability classes). From Figure 3 it is clear that land strategic for human settlements 277 (SLLI of 60-100) is mostly located along activity corridors and close to urban areas. Gauteng 278 and Mpumalanga provinces possess the majority of land; however they are also the two 279 smallest provinces in the country. It is necessary for the DRDLR and mangers to identify land 280 for human settlements using the SLLI so as to ensure that people are resettled where there are 281 necessary supporting services and also avoid mistakes of the past where people where settled 282 far away from economic opportunities. Moreover, the SLLI can be used to make comparisons 283 and motivate decisions objectively, unlike the current ad-hoc and subjective manner of 284 acquiring land. 285 286 [Insert Figure 3 here] 287 288 3 The summation using weighted linear combination (WLC) was chosen because it can easily be applied within a GIS environment using map algebra operations and the approach is also intuitively appealing to decision makers (Malczewski & Rinner 2015). 7In Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN) the highly strategic land in a dark green shade (SLLI 90-100) is also 289 along development corridors. Likewise, the most strategic land in the Eastern Cape is in the 290 central Eastern Cape. Similarly, in the Western Cape the most strategic land is on the Western 291 Cape seaboard and in the South Western Cape known for their picturesque vineyards. 292 293 [Insert Figure 4 here] 294 295 Table 4 gives an overview of the amount of strategic land available to establish human 296 settlements in South Africa. Only 7% of the country is highly suitable (SLLI of > 75) for human 297 settlements and 18% moderately suitable. These areas have to be targeted, as they are highly 298 accessible, already contain infrastructure and services as well as supporting land uses. This also 299 confirms the high disparity in South Africa as only few areas are well endowed (Bradstock, 300 2006). This will most likely lead to further densification and congestion in already established 301 areas, which can ultimately lead to inability to promote sustainability and smart cities. The 302 question therefore becomes, can more growth in these areas be sustained or should growth be 303 channelled elsewhere? Perhaps a paradigm shift in the county is required which focuses on 304 high-rise and high-density buildings as opposed to owning a land parcel. 305 306 Forty six per cent of the country is largely unsuitable for human settlements. This poses a 307 challenge in distribution of resources and can have implications in migration patterns as well 308 as hampering plans of creating smart cities. As a result, areas such as Cape Town, Durban and 309 Johannesburg continue to receive migrants and are plagued with service delivery issues and 310 these cities are known to be hotspots for service delivery protests (Tapela, 2013). This may as 311 well suggest that metropolitan cities in South Africa have reached a tipping point. 312 313 [Insert table 4 here] 314 315 It should be noted that the suitability for human settlements land reform is not evenly 316 distributed within the provinces (Table 5) further highlighting the inequalities in South Africa 317 20 years after independence. 318 319 [Insert Table 5 here] 320 321 Gauteng contains the largest (69%) of highly suitable land for human settlements per province, 322 because it is the country’s economic hub, highly urbanised area and yet it is the smallest 323 province in land size (Statistics South Africa, 2011). Continued resettling of people in Gauteng 324 is less costly as Gauteng contains infrastructure and services suitable for human habitation. 325 However, there should be caution as pressure on Gauteng will result in congestion, 326 overcrowding, and damage to the environment and strain on services which can lead to reduced 327 carrying capacity if necessary improvements and adjustments are not made. Gauteng is also 328 identified as highly suitable for agriculture (Musakwa et al. 2014); therefore there is conflict 329 between resettling for agriculture and or human settlements. Consequently, there has to be a 330 tool that facilitates decision-making amongst competing objectives. 331 332 Kwa Zulu-Natal contains 30% of highly suitable land and offers a better solution than Gauteng, 333 as it is much larger and also contains infrastructure and services necessary for human 334 habitation, particularly along the coast. The Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape 335 are generally harsh environments mainly due to climatic reasons as they have 53%, 57% and 336 70% of unsuitable land. The highly suitable land in the Cape provinces is mostly along activity 337 corridors and already established towns along the coastline. For example, the City of Cape 338 8Town receives migrants from the Cape provinces as a result of its suitability and strategic 339 location (Kok & Collinson, 2006). This is mainly because the neighbouring provinces 340 (Northern Cape and Eastern Cape contain only 1% and 2 % of highly suitable land. Perhaps 341 there is need to attract investment and to channel development in these areas to improve 342 suitability for human settlements and minimise migration to other provinces. 343 344 It is important to note that the above statistics and maps are indicative of where to target areas 345 for land reform to establish human settlements. The SLLI therefore provides a scientific 346 procedure of targeting land for human settlements as opposed to the current ad hoc systems 347 (Hall, 2009). The objective of this study is to propose using GIS-MCDA, a technique that is 348 scientifically grounded in systematically identifying land for human settlements. This is unlike 349 the current systems available at the Housing Development Agency (HDA) that are small scale, 350 which do not employ a structured GIS-MCDA. Furthermore, with the SLLI undesirable and 351 disastrous consequences under the Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP) that 352 established human settlements far away from infrastructure, economic opportunities and 353 services can be avoided. Land reform ultimately needs to make its beneficiaries better off 354 (CDE, 2008). Little or nothing is gained in the long run if justice turns out to be purely 355 symbolic, leave people poorer, or even worse off (CDE, 2008). Accordingly, the SLLI is crucial 356 to complement the political aspect of land reform as it makes sure that land used is suitable for 357 human settlements land reform, leads to spatial integration, densification, does not perpetuate 358 poverty as well as enabling access to opportunities. Tshikotshi, (2009) notes that the post-359 apartheid government’s resettlement programme still locates the urban poor households on the 360 peripheries of the cities, a pattern similar to the apartheid era. Therefore, in light of this, the 361 SSLI can be viewed not only as a technical tool but an enabler that ensures that mistakes of the 362 past in land identification and settlement creation are not repeated as well as ensuring the 363 potential of urban areas is maximised when people, jobs, livelihood opportunities and services 364 are aligned (Integrated Urban Development Framework, 2014). 365 366 It should be recognised however that deciding on a piece of land is an optimising procedure, 367 as other factors have to be taken into account. For example the carrying capacity, land uses, 368 dolomite status, conservation, spatial targeting and issues of global climatic changes. 369 Accordingly, the SLLI was deployed on an ArcGIS server to aid in decision-making. 370 371 4.1 SLLI VIEWER 372 The SLLI was deployed as a web application, developed in Adobe Flex and works across 373 browsers with a flash plug-in. This is the first step in centralising and coordination of 374 information within the DRDLR and across government departments. Unlike the raster-based 375 information it is vector based and it is meant to simplify information to facilitate decision-376 making and increase usability. Moreover, most managers at provincial level are familiar and 377 work with vector (cadastral data) in their day-to-day activities. The SLLI viewer consists of 378 two main layers containing both the agricultural index (Musakwa et al., 2014) and human 379 settlements index with supporting criterion. The purpose of the SLLI viewer is to simplify the 380 daunting task of searching relative information on what land can be best used for. The solution 381 makes available answers to key questions to be asked in order to make the decision on land 382 use. 383 384 9Figure 5 shows the SLLI viewer-landing page. 385 386 [Insert Figure 5 here] 387 388 The main functionality of the SLLI viewer is the search function and reporting function. There 389 are two main functions, namely the search by parcel key, and detailed search (Figure 6). For 390 this function Land Managers can search for the index overlaid on national cadastre wherein 391 decision makers can search for a land parcel using the unique land parcel key known as the 21 392 digit code (Figure 7). Once the search is completed it collates the average index for that 393 particular parcel as well as accompanying criteria. The viewer also has a reporting functionality 394 that allows users to generate pdf reports and Excel file for further analysis (Figure 8). 395 396 [Insert Figure 6 here] 397 [Insert Figure 7 here] 398 399 In addition, the detailed search allows users to search for SLLI for human settlements using 400 attributes that are used to filter to the necessary land parcel. This also allows minimizing the 401 results to be returned for reporting and to improve performance on the viewer. Province, 402 District Municipality, Local Municipality are compulsory fields to select before a user can 403 search. These fields are also used to narrow the search to a subset of data and zoom into the 404 area selected. 405 406 [Insert Figure 8 here] 407 408 The SLLI viewer also contains standard functions such as, identification and measuring tools 409 that can enhance the decision-making process. The SLLI viewer compares well with planning 410 support systems such as the What If? (Petit et al, 2015) in that it is built for Planners. However, 411 the SLLI does not support scenario building like the What If? system. Therefore, in future, 412 there is potential to include scenario building, which would improve the functionality of the 413 tool. Furthermore, both systems (SLLI and What If?, are policy oriented, collaborative systems 414 and utilise cadastral data at a local level which most Planners are familiar with. Additionally, 415 the interface of the SLLI viewer is simple and developed in consultation with the planners to 416 improve user acceptance (Geertman, 2008). Unlike other sophisticated systems such as 417 WBBRIS, the SLLI has potential to be deployed in other developing countries battling with 418 land reform as the SLLI employs replicable standard GIS-MCDA processes. Likewise, there 419 is scope for use of the SLLI not only in human settlements land reform but also as an enabler 420 in sound land use management as what the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act 421 (SPLUMA Act of 2013) envisages. 422 423 424 4.2 LESSONS LEARNT AND CHALLENGES 425 The SLLI viewer has several limitations. Firstly it is a web-based application, only accessible 426 at the DRDLR head office. This can lead to the SLLI system not being readily used throughout 427 the country. A solution is packaging all the data used, the SLLI grids, and supporting data that 428 can be used for querying into a geodatabase digital video disk (DVD). This can then be 429 distributed to managers at provincial level to start using the SLLI tool to assist them in 430 identifying strategically located land. Moreover, the geodatabase requires only ArcGIS 431 software that is available within the DRDLR and other government departments. This will 432 mean that the SLLI will be employed more for day-to-day decision-making, as it will not be 433 dependent on the viewer, and it also requires minimal capital outlay, which is often an 434 10impediment to the use of GIS in developing countries (Klosterman, 2001). Further training 435 perhaps is needed to train particularly non-GIS experts on how to navigate and query the SLLI 436 geodatabase. Distributing, training and usage of the SLLI geodatabase will mean 437 decentralisation of functionally and it will also be part of capacity building. Managers will be 438 able to make quick decisions instead of relying on the head office. 439 440 Potential users of the SLLI pointed out that the criteria are broad as they are to be utilised for 441 a national geospatial tool to identify strategically located land for land reform for human 442 settlements. However, it was established that there is potential to develop specific sub-criteria 443 for various land uses in cities such as industrial uses and recreational uses. Consequently, there 444 would be a need to develop new tools or viewers that are context specific such as for industry 445 use or recreation. Nevertheless, there was broad consensus that the SLLI is a huge step towards 446 improving identification of strategically located land. Another challenge common to 447 developing countries is the access and availability of data. As a result users are advised not to 448 alter the current state of the SLLI viewer or the desktop package. Users can only query and 449 obtain results for use. However, with time, when required the SLLI index can be updated using 450 new data obtained. For example, it is anticipated that in the future data such as roads and towns 451 are to change, therefore it becomes critical that the index be updated using such data. 452 453 Similarly, it also emerged that there were over-expectations as some users deemed the SLLI as 454 a tool that is supposed to make the decision for them. It should be cautioned that the SLLI 455 viewer is supposed to aid or facilitate decision-making not making the decision for the user 456 (Geertman & Stillwell, 2004). As a result many supporting datasets that enhances querying 457 were included. The SLLI is not the panacea to land acquisition. However, it goes a long way 458 towards making sure that correct, appropriate, smart and suitable land parcels are acquired. It 459 also ensures consistency and objectivity in land acquisition 460 461 An additional challenge faced was creating a common ground as well as the need to provide a 462 history of how the SLLI was developed, explaining what it can and what it cannot do. Overall, 463 the users generally acknowledged the utility of the SLLI during the training workshops. 464 However, key issues that have to be solved are capacity and management constraints. Some 465 users indicated that they are not familiar with spatial decision support systems and GIS. 466 Consequently, they found the system intimidating which may hamper its use. This scenario is 467 not only common within DRDLR, but in other government departments and developing 468 countries (Göçmen & Ventura, 2010) 469 470 Another issue that was identified is the issue of propriety where it was identified by users that 471 the SLLI could be useful for various government departments with a stake in planning for 472 cities, as the SLLI would add value in their operations. The SLLI viewer has been 473 identified that it could be potentially useful for the Housing Development Agency (HDA). 474 However, at present, functionality across government departments is not available as it is 475 strictly proprietary to one department. Sharing information across departments has been cited 476 as an impediment to the development process (Klosterman, 1995, 2001). Perhaps other 477 departments can make arrangements, as this will greatly facilitate coordination and 478 streamlining of decision-making, which will ultimately lead to efficient utilisation of resources 479 and creation of smart cities. Similarly, a challenge with the SLLI is that it was developed at 480 national level, which possibly implies that municipal powers are usurped and it may mean 481 unwillingness of local government to utilize the SLLI. Therefore, it requires coordination 482 between national and local governments for successful implementation and buy-in. 483 Nevertheless, the political, administration and operational challenges of universal use in 484 11government departments is hampered by political interest, operational deficiencies, and general 485 lack of tools to ensure meaningful coordination and successful implementation of land use 486 management tools in South Africa and Africa in general. Ultimately the successful 487 implementation of the SLLI depends on the interaction of macro-level processes with local- 488 level factors, overlapping legal and governance frameworks and, power relations (Lombard, 489 2015) 490 491 Despite the identified technical, operational and political challenges, the SLLI has been 492 generally accepted as a useful tool in identifying land for land reform. However, the success of 493 the land reform program goes beyond using a tool, as concerns of pressure groups with vested 494 interests have to be navigated. The continued success and implementation of the SLLI rests on 495 political buy-in from various stakeholders. Currently, it appears that the SLLI has weathered 496 some of the political storms as it is used as a standard tool within the DRDLR to identify land 497 for acquisition and as a general land use management tool. We also acknowledge that 498 politically connected people who can delay the adaptation of sound land use management tools 499 to their advantage may hamper the universal use of the SLLI. 500 501 5 CONCLUSION 502 This study aimed to develop tools that help identify land suitable for human settlements land 503 reform. A consultative and participatory process using GIS-MCDA was utilised to develop the 504 SLLI. A key component of the SLLI is that it enables streamlining and better decision making 505 based on a scientific basis, unlike the current systems. Consequently, the SLLI can assist 506 through acquisition of appropriate land, which enables creation of smart cities. The SLLI can 507 also be adapted and applied in countries with land reform problems. Similarly, the SLLI can 508 be applied to solve other problems such as identifying land potential. However, the SLLI 509 viewer only guides but does not make the decision. Other factors such as government policy, 510 human judgment and internal process have to be taken into cognisance. Lastly, a multitude of 511 challenges such as capacity issues and political interests have to be navigated for the SLLI to 512 be fully used in practice. Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction towards a more 513 structured process in establishing human settlements to ensure that cities are smart and liveable 514 for all. 515 516 517 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 518 This work was made possible by funding from the Faculty Research Committee, Faculty of 519 Engineering and the Built Environment, University of Johannesburg, South Africa and Agizo 520 Solutions.
