Climate-sensitive urban design is an increasingly important consideration for city planners and policy makers. This study demonstrates the use of a biophysical model to assess the response of urban climate to various changes, including population growth, reduced energy use, urban development and urban greening initiatives. Model inputs are intentionally derived using only publicly available information and assumptions involved in collating the data are discussed. Results are summarised in terms of the energy partitioning which captures changes in meteorology, surface characteristics and human behaviour. The model has been recently evaluated for the region, and those findings are drawn upon here to discuss the model’s capabilities and limitations. Model simulations demonstrate how both intentional and inadvertent changes to the urban landscape can alter the urban climate. For example, the impact of population growth depends on where, and how, people are housed, and recent changes in garden composition have reduced evaporation.

IntroductionGrowth in urban populations puts increasing pressure on cityplanners, policy makers and society to develop in a sustainable andresilient manner. Cities must have the capacity to mitigate the impactsof extreme weather in order to minimise damage to human health, theenvironment and the economy. Urban climate-related risks include, butare not limited to, thermal stress, ﬂooding, air quality events andextreme wind (e.g. Bell et al., 2007; Chen, Hill, & Urbano, 2009; Dessai,2002; Hsieh &Wu, 2012). In many cases the urban environmentenhances these risks. For example, urban areas are known to exacerbateheat stress for the following reasons:• The relatively limited amount of vegetation reduces the opportunityfor evaporation and its associated cooling eﬀects, contributing tocity temperatures that are typically a few degrees higher than in thesurrounding countryside (Howard, 1833; Oke, 1982).• Paved and built surfaces (e.g. roads, carparks, roofs) are fairlyimpermeable to water so rainfall is quickly routed into drainagesystems and directed away from the surface, thus removing thesource of moisture for evaporation (Grimmond &Oke, 1986;Grimmond, Oke, & Steyn, 1986; Oke, 1982; Xiao, McPherson,Simpson, & Ustin, 2007).• Buildings and roads absorb and store a large proportion of heatduring the day and the release of this heat after sunset meanstemperatures may remain high throughout the night (e.g.Grimmond &Oke, 1999b; Kotthaus & Grimmond, 2014a; Oﬀerle,Grimmond, & Fortuniak, 2005; Roberts, Oke, Grimmond, & Voogt,2006).• Dark surfaces (such as asphalt) absorb solar radiation well, and thearrangement of buildings and roads can trap energy, furtherincreasing the heat available (Sailor, 1995; Taha, 1997).• Human activities provide additional energy: directly through heat-ing buildings and as waste heat from air-conditioning units,electrical appliances, cooking, transportation and human metabo-lism (e.g. Bergeron & Strachan, 2010; Hamilton et al., 2009; Sailor,2011). In densely populated areas, this anthropogenic energy supplycan be substantial (Ichinose, Shimodozono, & Hanaki, 1999; Klysik,1996).Urban design options to moderate heat stress include increasingvegetation cover (e.g. parks, street trees, green roofs), incorporatingwater bodies or using high albedo building materials (e.g. Lee,Mayer, & Chen, 2016; Nakayama & Fujita, 2010; Ng, Chen,Wang, & Yuan, 2012; Sailor, 1995). Decisions may sometimes haveunforeseen and/or detrimental eﬀects.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/BY/4.0/).MARKair-conditioning in warm conditions releases additional waste heat intothe environment, further augmenting temperatures and exacerbatingheat stress, and putting pressure on power supplies (de Munck et al.,2013; Ohashi et al., 2007; Ramamurthy, Li, & Bou-Zeid, 2015). Tolower carbon emissions, one way to encourage use of public transportover private cars is to increase the cost of residents’ parking permits. InLondon, this has led to more people paving over their front gardens sothey can park oﬀ-road (GLA, 2005b). Vegetation and pervious gravel/soil surfaces have been replaced by impervious concrete or asphalt,enhancing runoﬀ and reducing inﬁltration of rain water, with the resultthat evaporation is restricted.Biophysical models use information about the urban surface (e.g.land cover, building height, radiative properties such as albedo orreﬂectivity) and inhabitants (population density, energy use), alongwith past, present or predicted meteorological data to simulatecomponents of the energy balance and/or water balance and thusinform about the environmental conditions. In addition to identifyingregions with the greatest risk of exposure, models can also indicate howthe risk may change over time. The physical processes represented inmodels enable us to understand why the risk may be greater undercertain conditions and, conversely, to identify measures that may beused to reduce exposure. Models permit the advantages and disadvan-tages to be explored to better inform planning decisions beforeinvestments are made. For example, the impact of several urban coolingmeasures (including water, vegetation, high albedo surfaces andbuilding dimensions) on pedestrian thermal comfort was assessed fora district in Toulouse that will soon undergo redevelopment (Martinset al., 2016). Potential feedbacks resulting from decisions (made bycitizens or government) can be assessed. In the Toulouse study, the highalbedo scenario was found to negatively impact pedestrian comfort asmore radiation was reﬂected from walls towards pedestrians.Understanding and managing climate-related risks in cities is ofprime importance, particularly as more variable and more extremeweather is expected in future (IPCC, 2012). The focus of this study isGreater London, home to more than 8 million people (ONS, 2011) andwith a daytime population (including workers and tourists) in excess of10 million (GLA, 2013). The Greater London region is divided into 33districts: 32 boroughs plus the City of London. For brevity, we refer toall 33 subdivisions as boroughs. There are 12 inner boroughs (plus Cityof London) and 20 outer boroughs (Fig. 1). Each borough is governedby a borough council (the City of London is governed by the City ofLondon Corporation), responsible for education, provision of servicesand urban planning. Some planning decisions are also made by theGreater London Authority, responsible for London as a whole. Theboroughs represent useful units in terms of governance and theavailability of socio-economic data (such as poverty, health statusand access to services) which can be used to gauge vulnerability (e.g.Wolf &McGregor, 2013). In future, borough-level risk estimates couldbe combined with socio-economic data in a move towards interdisci-plinary modelling of cities that involves social, economic and biophy-sical aspects of the city system (Masson et al., 2014). This would enableadaptive or coping strategies to be targeted towards exposed areas thatare most vulnerable.Numerous indicators exist to describe thermal (dis)comfort (deFreitas & Grigorieva, 2015), usually based on temperature and oftenmodiﬁed according to some combination of humidity, wind speed,radiation receipt or other variables in an attempt to account for thephysiological and psychological eﬀects that translate the physical airtemperature to thermal comfort experienced by humans (Johansson,Thorsson, Emmanuel, & Krüger, 2014). Well-known examples includethe physiological equivalent temperature (Höppe, 1999), mean radianttemperature (Thorsson et al., 2014) and universal thermal climateindex (Jendritzky, de Dear, & Havenith, 2012). Mesoscale modellingstudies often rely on 2 m air temperature output, sometimes combinedwith humidity, to represent human comfort (e.g. Theeuwes,Solcerová, & Steeneveld, 2013). Remotely sensed land surface tempera-ture (Wolf &McGregor, 2013) or urban heat island intensity(Tomlinson, Chapman, Thornes, & Baker, 2011) products are also used.Alexander, Fealy, &Mills (2016) considers the impact of urban devel-opment in terms of the surface energy balance. Certain indicators maybe more or less suited to particular applications, depending on spatialscale, period of interest and data available. Microscale studies mayconsider diﬀerences between sunlit and shaded areas around individualbuildings (e.g. Lindberg, Holmer, & Thorsson, 2008; Middel, Häb,Brazel, Martin, & Guhathakurta, 2014), whereas the computationaldemands of mesoscale simulations usually restrict the study period toa few days for typical grid-box sizes. A more user-friendly approach isadopted in this study to examine how London’s climate responds at thelocal-scale to changes in meteorology, urban design and policy.The objectives of this paper are: (i) to assess the response of theurban environment across Greater London to changes in surfacecharacteristics, population and energy use; (ii) to explain the routesby which these changes aﬀect the urban climate; (iii) to demonstrate amethodology which could subsequently be applied to other cities.2. The biophysical model2.1. Model descriptionThis study uses the Surface Urban Energy and Water balanceScheme (SUEWS), which has already been evaluated against observa-tional datasets at two urban sites in this region (Ward, Kotthaus,Järvi, & Grimmond, 2016). SUEWS considers the urban surface com-prised of seven surface types (paved surfaces, buildings, evergreen treesand shrubs, deciduous trees and shrubs, grass, bare soil and open water)with a single-layer soil store beneath each surface (except water). Theexchange of energy at the surface is written (Oke, 1987):Q * + QF = QH + QE + ΔQS. (1)Q* is net all-wave radiation; QF is anthropogenic heat ﬂux, i.e. theadditional energy supplied through human activities. These inputs heatthe air (QH, turbulent sensible heat ﬂux), evaporate water (QE,turbulent latent heat ﬂux) or are stored in (and later released from)the urban volume (ΔQS, net storage heat ﬂux). The storage heat ﬂux iscalculated using the Objective Hysteresis Model (OHM, Grimmond,Cleugh, & Oke (1991)). Evaporation is calculated using an adaptedPenman-Monteith equation (Grimmond &Oke, 1991) with surfaceconductance formulated after Jarvis (1976), Ward et al. (2016a). Arunning water balance is calculated at each time-step, providing soilmoisture, runoﬀ and surface wetness. Further details can be found inJärvi, Grimmond, and Christen (2011), Järvi et al. (2014) and Wardet al. (2016a).One of the advantages of SUEWS is its simplicity. High-performancecomputing is unnecessary, even when running the model for multipleyears or multiple areas. Required inputs include information about thesurface characteristics (e.g. land cover, building height, albedo, emis-sivity) and human behaviour (energy use, water use, populationdensity), along with basic meteorological data: incoming shortwaveor solar radiation (K↓), air temperature (Tair), relative humidity (RH),barometric pressure (p), wind speed (U) and precipitation (P). Theversatility of the model allows additional input information to beaccepted if available (Lindberg, Grimmond, Onomura, & Järvi, 2015),otherwise recommended values should provide a reasonable approx-imation in many cases (Ward, Järvi, Onomura, & Lindberg, & Grim-mond, 2016). Key site-speciﬁc information may need to be derivedfrom other sources (Section 3.1).The model runs in this study were performed using SUEWS v2016a(Ward et al., 2016b). Here, we focus on the modelled energy ﬂuxes (Eq.(1)). Results are presented in terms of the energy partitioning using themedian midday (1100–1400) Bowen ratio (QH/QE), βMM. Severalstudies have concluded that the balance between evaporation andH.C. Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161143sensible heat ﬂux is a key factor inﬂuencing elevated urban tempera-tures and contributing to the urban heat island (Fischer, Seneviratne,Lüthi, & Schär, 2007; Li and Bou-Zeid, 2013; Li et al., 2015). The lessenergy used for evaporation, the more energy is available for heatingthe atmosphere and augmenting air temperatures, i.e. greater risk ofthermal stress. Since βMM includes QH and QE, it will respond to changesin the surface energy partitioning which result from meteorologicalconditions (including temperature and humidity), surface water avail-ability, additional energy supplied by anthropogenic activities, landcover characteristics, properties of surface materials and state ofvegetation. This approach can therefore be used to summarise theimpact of a range of urban development or climate mitigation strategieson urban climate.2.2. Model evaluationModel output should always be interpreted with care, especiallywhen applied to a region or conditions that diﬀer from those for whichthe model has been tested. The year-round performance of SUEWS wasrecently evaluated using observational datasets collected in centralLondon, UK, and suburban Swindon (a large town located about120 km to the west of London) during the period 2011–2013. We aretherefore able to present this application of the model across GreaterLondon with a thorough understanding of its performance. To set themodel results in context, values from the observed datasets areprovided where available. These are denoted ‘OBS URB’ for the denseurban central London site and ‘OBS SUB’ for the suburban residentialSwindon site. The UK evaluation demonstrated good performance insummer, particularly for the suburban site, but highlighted two issues.Firstly, there is insuﬃcient information to enable the OHM coeﬃcientsused to calculate the storage heat ﬂux to account for building volume ordensity of building materials, with the result that ΔQS is underestimatedand QH overestimated at URB. Secondly, evaporation from open wateris likely overestimated, contributing to a modelled QE that is too high.The reader is referred to the full evaluation paper for detaileddiscussion (Ward et al., 2016a).In addition to the UK evaluation, SUEWS has also been evaluatedagainst observations at suburban sites in Los Angeles and Vancouver,North America (Järvi et al., 2011); for residential areas of cold-climatecities in Helsinki and Montreal (Järvi et al., 2014); also at a city-centresite in Helsinki (Karsisto et al., 2015); and at an urban and suburbansite in Dublin (Alexander, Mills, & Fealy, 2015). These studies demon-strate that SUEWS generally reproduces reasonable results, particularlyfor suburban areas during summer months. In dense urban areas thelarge magnitude and considerable spatial variability of QF presents achallenge to both modelling and measurement, so uncertainties arelargest in these areas. In general, as for the UK sites, ΔQS appears to beunderestimated for dense urban areas (Järvi et al., 2014). As QE is oftensmall in city centres it can be diﬃcult to measure and model accurately(Karsisto et al., 2015; Kotthaus & Grimmond, 2014a). These are fairlytypical issues encountered by modellers and urban climatologists, asopposed to particular limitations of SUEWS.3. MethodologyAn objective here is to demonstrate a methodology for locationslacking detailed information. Thus, the model runs have been carriedout using readily available information. One advantage of SUEWS is itsrelatively undemanding input requirements, but appropriate meteor-ological forcing data, representative surface cover and reasonableestimates of energy use are important.The ﬂexibility of SUEWS allows the user to deﬁne model grids (e.g.to reﬂect data availability and areas of interest). The focus of this workis at borough-level, but diﬀerent areas can be speciﬁed depending onthe application. Each borough is treated as a separate model grid and, atthis coarse scale, there is no interaction between grids. The approxima-tion has been made that all boroughs experience the same meteorolo-gical forcing, but surface characteristics must be speciﬁed individuallyfor each borough.To give an idea of the summertime behaviour under diﬀerentconditions, data for the month of July in two consecutive years (2011,2012) with very diﬀerent rainfall patterns are analysed. 2011 was a dryyear (602 mm rainfall, 76% of the 1981–2010 Normal for southernEngland), whereas 2012 was very wet (1047 mm rainfall, 132% of theFig. 1.

Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161144Normal) (Met Oﬃce, 2016). SUEWS is run from 1 January for the twoyears of interest, allowing several months’ spin-up prior to the July studyperiods. The model setup and parameters are essentially the same as forthe evaluation in central London (Ward et al., 2016a), except for themeteorological forcing data and site-speciﬁc input.3.1. Preparation of input information3.1.1. Meteorological forcing dataThe required meteorological forcing is provided by the WFDEIglobal data product (Weedon et al., 2014), available at 0.5° × 0.5°resolution at 3-h intervals for 1979–2012, downscaled to the modeltime-step (5-min). Diﬀerences in incoming shortwave radiation, rainfalland relative humidity result in small diﬀerences when using WFDEIinstead of observed data: Q* is overestimated but the impact on the heatﬂuxes is reduced by compensating eﬀects (see Appendix A).3.1.2. Surface cover fractionsNeighbourhood Statistics (NeSS, 2014) provides land cover data foreach borough based on the Generalised Land Use Database (GLUD). Themost recent 2005 dataset is used here. The following additionalinformation is used to convert the GLUD classes (domestic buildings,non-domestic buildings, road, path, rail, domestic gardens, greenspace,water, other land uses, unclassiﬁed land) to the SUEWS land coverclasses (Section 2.1):(i) A breakdown of land cover types within gardens for 2006–8 (Smithet al., 2011)(ii) Total tree cover in London is 20% (GLA, 2005a)(iii) It is assumed 20% (80%) of trees are evergreen (deciduous).Thus, domestic gardens are split up into land cover types using (i);the total proportion of trees (ii) in greenspace plus gardens is used todeduce the proportion of greenspace that is grass; road, path and railare counted as paved surfaces; other land uses and unclassiﬁed land arecounted as bare soil surfaces.Surface cover varies widely across London (Table 1, Fig. 2). City ofLondon has the highest proportion (70%) of impervious surfaces (45%buidings, 25% paved surfaces), followed by Kensington and Chelsea,Islington, and Westminster (60%). These are also the least vegetatedboroughs (City of London has only 5% vegetation), along with TowerHamlets which has the highest proportion of water (22%). The outerboroughs are much more vegetated, with agricultural land towards theedge of the city, open greenspace (parks and commons) and largegardens. Bromley and Havering comprise over 70% vegetation. Thespatial variability within boroughs tends to be most pronounced incentral London, for example Westminster contains two large parks(Hyde Park and Regent’s Park) but is very densely built-up outside theseareas. The outer boroughs are predominantly suburban. Substantialwater bodies include the River Thames which runs through the centreof London, as well as other open water (lakes, reservoirs, docks) inTower Hamlets, Waltham Forest and Enﬁeld, for example. The bor-oughs range in size from 150 km2 (Bromley) to 12 km2 (Kensington andChelsea) (City of London is 3.3 km2).The observation site URB is located in a very densely built up area ofWestminster borough, close to the boundary with City of London(Fig. 1). The proportion of paved and building surfaces at the URB site(81%) is greater than the borough averages. The proportion ofvegetation (5%) is similar to City of London and the proximity to theriver means 14% of the source area is made up of open water. The URBsite thus represents amongst the most densely built up, least vegetated,and highly populated areas of London. The observation site SUB is moresimilar to the average values, with 45% vegetation and 49% impervioussurfaces. For more details about the observation sites see the originalreferences for these datasets (Kotthaus & Grimmond, 2014a, 2014b;Ward, Evans, & Grimmond, 2013).3.1.3. Surface characteristicsCharacteristics for each surface type are, in this application,assumed to be the same for all boroughs (Table 2). In reality, thevariety of building materials will lead to diﬀerences in surface proper-ties at the neighbourhood scale or below. The values selected arerepresentative of the surfaces in general (e.g. buildings in Europeancities) and are the same as those used for the model evaluation.Building height is estimated at 6.5 m for outer boroughs, 10.0 m forinner boroughs, 20.0 m for Westminster and 25.0 m for City of London(based on Lindberg & Grimmond (2011)). Tree heights are estimated asfunction of building height (Lindberg & Grimmond, 2011). Roughnesslength and displacement height are calculated within SUEWS using therule-of-thumb (Grimmond &Oke, 1999a). Other required characteris-tics are assumed to be the same across London as public quantitativedata are unavailable. Ward et al. (2016a) shows that surface cover andenergy use play important roles in surface energy partitioning, whereasbuilding height and small diﬀerences in meteorology generally havelittle impact on model output.3.1.4. Anthropogenic energy useThe anthropogenic heat ﬂux QF can either be provided as inputtime-series data or calculated within SUEWS. Here, QF is calculatedwithin SUEWS to enable values to respond to changes in temperature,population or energy-use characteristics for diﬀerent scenarios.SUEWS calculates QF based on heating degree days (HDD), coolingdegree days (CDD) and population density, ρpop, (Järvi et al., 2011;Sailor & Vasireddy, 2006):Q ρ a a CDD a HDD= [ + + ],F pop F F F0 1 2 (2)where aF0,1,2 are coeﬃcients related to non-temperature dependentenergy use, building cooling and building heating, respectively. Thesecoeﬃcients can be speciﬁed individually for weekdays and weekendsand for each model grid. Alternatively generic coeﬃcients could beused for particular land use types (e.g. residential, commerical).Population data from the 2011 census (ONS, 2011) are used here.The average of the workday and resident (night-time) population isused as some boroughs have a low resident population but very largeworkday population, particularly in central London (Table 1, Fig. 3a).The same aF0,1,2 coeﬃcients are used for all boroughs with separatevalues for weekdays and weekends. The coeﬃcients were informed bythe GreaterQF model (Iamarino, Beevers, & Grimmond, 2012)(Appendix B). Compared to GreaterQF, this approach underestimatesQF by about 30 W m−2 (≈20%) for City of London and by about10 W m−2 for Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster, and is withinabout 3 W m−2 for most other boroughs. Modelled QF varies consider-ably between boroughs (Fig. 3b), with mean annual values for 2012between 3.9 W m−2 (Bromley) and 111.7 W m−2 (City of London).In reality, population varies through the day and workers andresidents have diﬀerent energy-use proﬁles (e.g. Hamilton et al., 2009;Ichinose et al., 1999). SUEWS’ simple approach provides an estimate ofQF from readily available information, but output from more complexmodels could be included if appropriate. Accurate estimates of QF aremore important for densely populated areas (where QF is large relativeto other terms in the energy balance (Eq. (1))) than suburban areaswhere a rough estimate of 5–10 W m−2 may be suﬃcient.External water use is assumed negligible as residents in the UK tendto irrigate far less extensively than in climates with hotter driersummers (Alexander et al., 2015; Ward et al., 2016a).3.2. Model scenariosFig. 4 summarises the mechanisms by which model inputs used todescribe the urban surface inﬂuence the energy ﬂuxes.

Model output from these ‘alternative scenarios’are then compared to the ‘base run’ (input data as described in Section3.1).Several example scenarios based on real situations have beendeveloped to illustrate the versatility of this approach (Table 3)Fig. 3.

Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161147Inadvertent climate modiﬁcation by residents’ decisions about theirgardens is considered in scenario 1, based on Smith et al. (2011) whichdescribes the actual change in garden composition that occurredbetween 1998–9 and 2006–8. Scenario 2 considers the Mayor ofLondon's plans for increased tree cover, based on published reportsfrom the Greater London Authority (GLA, 2011). Scenarios 1 and 2therefore involve changes to the surface cover fractions, fi. In scenario3, a 50% reduction in vehicle use is simulated, mimicking similarmeasures to improve air quality in other cities (e.g. Zhang, LinLawell, & Umanskaya, 2017). In scenario 4, an increase in populationdensity is considered, ﬁrst with no change to the landscape (ρpopincreases directly aﬀecting QF, indirectly aﬀecting the available en-ergy), then with associated changes in building density (increasedbuilding fraction or building height, directly aﬀecting ΔQS and/or QE).The required change in building density is estimated using inputinformation for the base run (Appendix C). Scenario 5 combines severalmeasures for climate-sensitive development (reducing energy consump-tion, increasing vegetation). Finally, the impact of meteorologicalconditions is explored by running the model with forcing data from2011 and 2012.4. Results4.1. Variability across greater London (‘base run’)Fig. 5 shows the modelled βMM values for July 2011/2012. In 2012values range from 0.41 (Bexley) to 2.71 (City of London). Thedistribution is positively skewed with values for most (25/33) boroughsbelow 1.00 and a few higher values: City of London, Islington,Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster. Compared to other summertimestudy periods, values for July 2012 are generally low reﬂecting themeteorological and surface conditions (frequent rainfall maintainingmoist soils). In July 2011 the range of βMM is greater (from 0.65(Bexley) to 3.57 (Islington)) and the magnitude is larger for allboroughs except Tower Hamlets (0.75 in 2011, 0.78 in 2012). In bothyears, inner boroughs tend to have higher βMM than outer boroughs.However, underestimation of QF (Section 3.1.4) is thought to result in aslight underestimation in βMM for City of London.Observational campaigns in urban areas have found that vegeta-tion plays a major role in surface energy partitioning, with increasingvegetation fraction often linked with decreasing summertime Bowenratio (e.g. Christen & Vogt, 2004; Grimmond & Oke, 2002; Oﬀerle,Grimmond, Fortuniak, & Pawlak, 2006). Primarily, this behaviour isexplained by the greater evaporation potential of vegetation andpermeable soil surfaces compared to impervious built surfaces. Theimpervious surfaces tend to have very little capacity to storemoisture and thus dry quickly after wetting with most surface watergoing to runoﬀ which is rapidly removed via pipes and seweragesystems.SUEWS reproduces this behaviour (Fig. 5a,c): βMM is seen todecrease as vegetation fraction increases. The rate of change is greatestwhen there is only a small proportion of vegetation. Those boroughswith little vegetation have the highest βMM: City of London, followed byIslington, Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster (numbers 7, 19, 20and 33 in Fig. 5a,c). At the other end of the spectrum, Bromley (5) andHavering (16) are ≥70% vegetation and have low βMM. The observedvalues (URB and SUB in Fig. 5a,c) demonstrate that the model isperforming reasonably. Bexley (3) and Tower Hamlets (30) both havenotably low βMM given their vegetation fractions because theseboroughs contain a signiﬁcant proportion of open water (Fig. 2), which,according to the model, can evaporate freely. Note that comparison ofmodelled and observed values at the URB site suggested that SUEWSprobably overestimates evaporation from open water (Ward et al.,2016a), however this is a topic of ongoing research since is it is notcurrently clear whether the depth of the River Thames constrains itstemperature and restricts evaporation, or whether considerable eva-poration from the river is taking place but is not detected at the heightof the sensor (Kotthaus and Grimmond, 2014b). In Figs. 6 and 7 βMM isinstead plotted as a function of the proportion of vegetation plus waterarea.The robustness of these results is assessed by comparing themonthly average βMM with daily values (Fig. 6a).

Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161148are representative of the daily values, although the range of valuesincreases as βMM increases (also seen in the observations). The fewpoints below 0 occurred on 16 July 2012 which was rainy and overcastso heat ﬂuxes were small. The ﬁve-day period 22–26 July 2012,identiﬁed as a heat-wave in London (using the method in Li et al.(2015)), had clear-skies, no rain and mean daily temperatures of21.5 °C (cf. monthly mean daily temperature of 17.0 °C measured atURB). βMM on these heat-wave days (crosses, Fig. 6) is generally higherthan on other days (exceptions for Bexley and Tower Hamlets arerelated to evaporation from water surfaces).To investigate the relative conditions in each borough, daily βMMvalues are ranked from 1 (lowest) to 33 (highest) (Fig. 6b). City ofLondon always has the highest βMM, followed by Islington. Althoughmost boroughs change rank with neighbouring boroughs (in terms ofrank order, not geographical location) depending on meteorological,surface and sub-surface conditions, the overall ranking remains similarthroughout the study period. Exceptions are, again, Bexley and TowerHamlets. Their substantial water reserves evaporate freely on sunnydays with abundant energy whereas evaporation is limited on cloudierdays with lower energy input. Therefore, for these boroughs, thesunniest days are those with lower rank positons (e.g. during theheat-wave). Other boroughs with lower rank positions during heat-wave days also contain large areas of water, for example Hammersmithand Fulham, Newham, Waltham Forest, Westminster. Although openwater evaporation in SUEWS requires more detailed evaluation, thequalitative result that water bodies help ameliorate heat stress is inagreement with other studies (e.g. Theeuwes et al., 2013).Results are similar for July 2011, but with more variation in dailyvalues and less consistent rank positions (Fig. 7). Frequent rainfall in2012 maintains a plentiful supply of moisture: the surface is often wetfollowing rainfall and soils are moist. In 2011, less frequent rainfallallows the surfaces to dry out, reducing evaporation (except where themoisture supply is maintained by large water bodies; those boroughshave notably low rankings in Fig. 7b). This behaviour results in a widerspread of βMM values. That rainfall prompts a sharp decrease in theBowen ratio followed by an increase as surfaces dry has been demon-strated in observational data (Kotthaus & Grimmond, 2014a; Wardet al., 2013). Diﬀerences in evaporation between years can also resultfrom diﬀerences in Q*, but summer 2011 and 2012 were both cloudierthan normal (1981–2010).There is little spatial variation in Q* between boroughs (Fig. 8).Incoming shortwave (K↓) and longwave (L↓) radiation are identical forall boroughs as the same meteorological forcing has been assumed(Section 3.1.1). Atmospheric pollution can lead to reduced shortwaveradiation receipt in city centres compared to their surroundings(Arnﬁeld, 2003). The size of this reduction is about 10% in London(Ryder and Toumi, 2011) but can be larger for more polluted cities(Jáuregui & Luyando, 1999). Conversely, an increase in L↓ is typical dueto warmer temperatures and increased pollutant concentration overcities (Arnﬁeld, 2003; Christen & Vogt, 2004). These eﬀects are notsimulated here but, to a certain extent, these urban-rural diﬀerences inK↓ and L↓ compensate for each other. The highest Q* values are thusobtained for the least vegetated boroughs with the lowest bulk albedos(≈0.12) and the lowest Q* values for the most vegetated boroughs withthe highest bulk albedos (≈0.17). Compared to the day-to-day varia-tion in midday Q*, diﬀerences between boroughs are small. This isthought to be realistic as many observational studies report littlediﬀerence in Q* between urban and rural sites or multiple sites withina city (e.g. Christen & Vogt, 2004; Schmid, Cleugh, Grimmond, & Oke,1991). For higher resolution studies, albedo could be adjusted toFig. 5.

Numerical labelscorrespond to boroughs (see Table 1). (b, d) Map of βMM for July (b) 2011 and (d) 2012. Boxplots show the inter-quartile range (IQR) with whiskers extending to the furthest point within1.5× IQR from the upper or lower quartile.H.C. Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161149incorporate the eﬀect of shading (Sailor & Fan, 2002) or to representspeciﬁc materials (e.g. slate tile versus ceramic tile roofs). Modelled Q*for all boroughs is larger than the observed values at the evaluationsites, mainly because the WFDEI K↓ is higher than the observed values(Appendix A).For midday in summer, these results suggest the additional energysupplied by anthropogenic activities is about 30% of Q* for City ofLondon (45% at URB). QF can be even more important in winter and athigh latitudes. For the most densely populated boroughs, QF acts toincrease QH as QE is limited by the low vegetation fraction and lack ofavailable moisture. Thus, boroughs with the highest QH tend to be thosewith the highest QF (City of London, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea,Westminster). The diﬀerence in energy partitioning between studyyears can be seen here: QH generally exceeds QE in July 2011, whereasQE exceeds QH for the more vegetated boroughs in July 2012 (Fig. 8).4.2. Model scenarios4.2.1. Scenario 1: change in garden compositionThe composition of gardens in London has changed over recentyears (Smith et al., 2011). Compared to 1998-9, gardens in 2006–8contain more buildings and paved surfaces (41% cf. 31%) and lessvegetation (58% cf. 65%). For this ﬁrst scenario, we assess the impacton local climate by considering the change in βMM if today’s (i.e.2006–8) garden composition was returned to that of 1998-9.Overall, domestic gardens comprise 24% of the total area of GreaterLondon. The decrease in vegetation fraction associated with the changein garden composition is small for many central boroughs, but for innerboroughs with appreciable amounts of garden (≈20%, e.g. Islington)the small increase in vegetation fraction causes a discernible reductionin βMM (Fig. 9a and b). For the outer boroughs, even though there is alot of garden space, the already higher vegetation fraction means thechange in garden composition generally has a smaller impact. However,all boroughs show a reduction in βMM, indicating that the change ingarden composition that has occurred since 1998-9 has altered thesurface-atmosphere exchange: nowadays more energy is directed toheating and less to evaporation. Such trends are expected to continue asmore people pave their front gardens for parking or opt for lowmaintenance gardens (GLA, 2005b). Other environmental impactsassociated with replacing vegetation with paved surfaces includereduced biodiversity and increased ﬂood risk. SUEWS suggests anincrease in annual runoﬀ of 5–15 mm due to this change in gardencomposition (modelled annual totals for each borough range between376 and 553 mm in 2012).The impact of these land cover changes on the surface energybalance can be understood using Fig. 4. Modifying the surface coverfractions changes the bulk radiative properties of the surface. Emissivityhas little impact on the output, but vegetation generally has higheralbedo than typical materials used for paving or building in the UK(Table 2) so the increase in bulk albedo results in lower Q*. Theanthropogenic heat ﬂux is unchanged by this scenario, but the storageheat ﬂux is reduced (as grass stores less heat than paved and buildingsurfaces, and because Q* is lower). The increase in vegetation fractionmeans more of the available energy is used in evaporation, leaving asmaller proportion for the sensible heat ﬂux. Hence QE increases and QHdecreases.Fig. 6. Boxplots of (a) daily median midday Bowen ratio βMM values and (b) rank (1 = lowest, 33 = highest) during July 2012 for each borough (arranged in order of decreasing fractionof vegetation + water). βMM values are also shown for the urban (URB) and suburban (SUB) observations (OBS). Crosses represent values on heat-wave days (22–26 July 2012).Numerical labels along the top are as given in Table 1.H.C. Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161150Buildings and paved surfaces tend to store (and later release) a largeamount of heat as their constituent materials have high heat capacities.In SUEWS, this behaviour is simulated through diﬀerent OHM coeﬃ-cients (a1,2,3) for each surface type. However, Ward et al. (2016a)suggests the range of OHM coeﬃcients in the literature may beinsuﬃcient to account for the wide range of urban surface types, withthe result that ΔQS may be underestimated in built-up areas. Centralboroughs (City of London, Kensington and Chelsea, Islington, Westmin-ster) have the highest ΔQS, but ΔQS OBS URB is much larger (Fig. 8). Asprevious work accounting for the three-dimensional building volumedid not signiﬁcantly improve the performance of OHM (and decreasedperformance in some cities) (Grimmond &Oke, 1999b), in the currentconﬁguration building height does not aﬀect ΔQS, although it isreasonable to expect larger ΔQS with greater built volume.4.2.2. Scenario 2: increase in tree coverRecognising the beneﬁts of urban trees (e.g. Salmond et al., 2016),the Mayor of London plans to increase London’s tree cover from 20% to25% by 2025 (GLA, 2011). Two scenarios are considered here: (i) treesreplace paved surfaces; (ii) trees replace grass surfaces (Table 3). Ineach case, the input surface cover fractions are altered so that the treecover increases by 25% for each borough (in line with total tree coverFig. 7. As for Fig. 6 but for July 2011.Fig. 8. Energy ﬂuxes (median midday values for July (a) 2011 and (b) 2012) as a function of vegetation fraction for the London boroughs (numbers, as Table 1) and for urban (URB) andsuburban (SUB) observations.H.C. Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161151across Greater London increasing from 20% to 25%).When trees replace paved surfaces βMM decreases across all bor-oughs (Fig. 9c–f). The largest changes in vegetation fraction occur forboroughs with the largest proportion of trees, but the largest changes inβMM occur where the vegetation fraction is small. The Mayor’s StreetTree Programme aims to plant new trees in the most deprived areas,including areas with few street trees (GLA, 2011). Although noborough-scale plans were available, this strategy will be more eﬀectivethan suggested by scenario 2i, as the rate of change of βMM is greaterwhere vegetation is scarce. The impact is also greater in 2011 than2012 (mean ΔβMM =−0.042/–0.018 in 2011/2012, which corre-sponds to a change in QH and QE of around ± 4 W m−2 assuming aQ* of 400 W m−2 and βMM≈ 1).If trees instead replace grass surfaces (scenario 2ii) there is nochange in vegetation fraction and the results are quite diﬀerent(Fig. 9g–j). The presence of more trees and less grass lowers the surfaceconductance, which decreases QE and allows QH to increase (meanΔβMM = 0.072/0.077 in 2011/2012). In 2011 the impact on the outerFig. 9. (a, c, e, g, i) Median midday Bowen ratio βMM as a function of vegetation fraction for the current situation and for scenarios 1 (July 2012) and 2 (July 2011, July 2012); (b, d, f, h,j) map of the change in βMM under each scenario (ΔβMM = βMM scenario− βMM original). Values for each borough are shown (alongside the legend) with their distribution (boxplot).Scenario 1 assumes a change in surface cover equivalent to returning today’s (i.e. 2006–8) garden composition to that of 1998–9. Scenario 2i/2ii constitutes an increase in tree cover withtrees replacing paved/grass surfaces. See text for details.H.C. Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161152boroughs is less than in 2012 (Fig. 9h, j), possibly because soil moisture(rather than vegetation fraction) plays a signiﬁcant role in limitingevaporation in dry years. These results highlight the importance ofconsidering both where trees will be planted and what will theyreplace. Note that the types of vegetation planted/replaced are alsorelevant. These can be represented in the model by specifying vegeta-tion characteristics (particularly maximum surface conductance).4.2.3. Scenario 3: reduction in road traﬃcScenario 3 considers a change in human behaviour, withoutchanging the landscape, namely a 50% reduction in vehicle usage.This scenario is intended to represent strict traﬃc controls enforced tomanage air pollution. For example, during the 2008 Beijing Olympics,vehicle use was restricted on alternate days based on odd/even licenceplates and vehicles not meeting emission standards were bannedcompletely, which meant only about 40% of vehicles were permittedto use the roads each day (Song &Wang, 2012; Yu, Wang, Zong,Li, & Lü, 2010). As well as the impact on pollutant emissions, therewill be an associated reduction in heat emissions.According to GreaterQF, vehicle use contributes about 15% of totalQF. To model a 50% reduction in road traﬃc, the coeﬃcient aF0 (seeSection 3.1.4) was reduced to 0.1457 and 0.1384 W m−2 (cap ha−1)−1on weekdays and weekends, respectively. These values were derivedusing the same method as the generic London borough coeﬃcients(Appendix B) but with the vehicle contribution halved. The reduction inQF reduces the energy input to the surface and results in lower βMM (notshown). The impact is generally very small (mean ΔβMM =−0.012 in2012), except for very densely populated boroughs, mainly becausebuilding energy use is so high. Policy may therefore be better directedtowards reducing building energy consumption. In warmer climates, airconditioning can substantially increase QF during summer, maintainingcooler indoor temperatures but exacerbating heat stress outside.Reducing transport use is much more important in terms of air quality(e.g. Beevers & Carslaw, 2005).4.2.4. Scenario 4: population increaseScenario 4 considers the impact of population increase. The residentpopulation of Greater London is expected to increase from 8.2 million(ONS, 2011) to 9.1 million by 2020 (GLA, 2014). Here, the percentageprojected change in resident population for each borough is applied tothe current population densities (Table 1). First, the impact of theadditional population alone (i.e. no new building) is considered(scenario 4i, Fig. 10a–d). There is negligible impact for boroughs whereρpop and QF is small (Bexley, Bromley, Havering) or where the change inpopulation is very small (Kensington and Chelsea Δρpop = 0.2%). Forcentral boroughs, the increase in ρpop caused an increase in βMM,particularly for City of London (ΔβMM = 0.155/0.253 in 2011/2012)where considerable population growth is combined with the alreadyhigh population density to increase QF (although note that part of thereason for this large change is due to the assumption that has beenmade in scaling the mean of day- and night-time ρpop by the projectedincrease in resident ρpop). The additional population has a larger impactduring dry weather as, when water is limited, the extra energy acts toincrease QH rather than QE.A more realistic scenario also increases the proportion of buildingsin order to provide the growing population with somewhere to live andwork. The increase in buildings required to match the populationgrowth was calculated from the relation between building fraction andρpop ﬁtted to the current values for each borough (Appendix C). Inscenario 4ii, the land cover fractions are adjusted to account for thisincrease in building fraction (the proportion of vegetation and bare soilis reduced accordingly; it is assumed existing paved, building and watersurfaces are not available to be built on). In scenario 4iii, the buildingfraction is increased as for scenario 4ii, but with a correspondingdecrease in bare soil surfaces only (i.e. development of unmanaged landrather than removing vegetation). In scenario 4iv, the land coverfractions are unchanged but building height is increased to providethe same new building volume as for scenario 4ii and iii.Results for scenario 4iv (not shown) are very similar to scenario 4i(within 0.5%) except for Tower Hamlets (Δρpop = 32%) where βMMincreases from 0.78 to 0.81 (scenario 4i) to 0.82 (scenario 4iv).Equivalent values for 2011 are 0.75 increasing to 0.79 and 0.82.These results suggest that building height has a much smaller impactthan building extent (assuming roughness length and displacementheight scale with mean building height). Note that the parameterswithin SUEWS were not changed to account for shading or radiationtrapping within the urban canyon, both of which increase with buildingheight, reducing daytime Q* but increasing night-time Q* (e.g.Mavrogianni et al., 2011).If building occurs horizontally rather than vertically, the associatedloss of vegetation increases βMM (scenario 4ii, Fig. 10e–h), particularlyfor the inner boroughs and more so for drier years than wetter years. Ifvegetated areas are protected from development and new buildings areconstructed only on bare soil, the impact is generally reduced (scenario4iii, Fig. 10i–l). This reduction is greater in 2012 than 2011, whichagain, is probably related to soil moisture availability. The lack ofrainfall in 2011 means soil moisture stores are low. When rain does fall,it can directly inﬁltrate the soil beneath pervious surfaces but notbeneath impervious surfaces (SUEWS assumes buildings and pavedsurfaces are totally impervious). A reduction in pervious surfaces (baresoil and vegetation) reduces inﬁltration and increases runoﬀ, so the soilreceives less water. Therefore, both scenario 4ii and 4iii have a largerimpact in 2011 than 2012, as in 2012 soil moisture is higher and less ofa limiting factor. Thus, the proportion of vegetation is the importantfactor in 2012, whilst the proportion of pervious surfaces is importantin 2011.4.2.5. Scenario 5: cimate-sensitive adaptationScenario 5 combines several aspects from previous scenarios toassess the potential impact of adapting London in a climate-sensitiveway (Table 3) including: reduced anthropogenic energy emissionsbrought about through improved energy eﬃciency of buildings andimproved access to public transport (see Appendix B); and increasedvegetation cover brought about through tree planting in innerboroughs (i.e. focusing on the least vegetated boroughs) and replacingbare soil with grass in wealthy boroughs (assuming wealthy boroughshave the means to develop unmanaged land into green spaces).Wealthy boroughs were identiﬁed as those with the top 20% highestmedian household income (GLA, 2012/3): Kensington and Chelsea,City of London, Westminster, Richmond upon Thames, Camden,Wandsworth.Scenario 5 results in a reduction in βMM across all boroughs, but thelargest changes occur for the inner boroughs (where the proportion ofvegetation increases and the considerable anthropogenic heat ﬂuxdecreases) and wealthy boroughs (where the proportion of vegetationincreases) (Fig. 11). The impact is greater in 2011 than 2012. Boroughsclassiﬁed as both inner boroughs and wealthy boroughs experience thelargest change: for Camden, City of London, Kensington and Chelsea,Wandsworth and Westminster ΔβMM exceeds -0.10 (Fig. 12). The de-crease in energy use for the outer boroughs (where QF is small) has asmall impact in 2012 (ΔβMM < −0.01 for many boroughs) but has agreater eﬀect in 2011. There would also be a reduction in carbonemissions associated with the decrease in fuel combustion for transportand home heating.All the scenarios presented here produce a change in the samedirection for all boroughs. However, alternative development pathwayscan be envisaged where the situation improves in some boroughs butworsens in others. For example, population growth accompanied byextensive building in some areas, compared to greening initiatives inother boroughs where there is less pressure on space. Input data can beeasily adapted to represent the relevant changes; the demonstrationshere are intended to be examples.H.C. Ward, C.S.B.

These scenarios assume an increase in population with (4i) no additional building; (4ii) an increase building fraction, with buildingsreplacing bare soil and vegetation; and (4iii) an increase in building fraction, with buildings replacing bare soil only. See text for details.H.C. Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–1611545. Summary and conclusionsNumerous policy decisions must be made without knowledge oftheir outcome. Scenario modelling can help inform about likely (orunintended) outcomes, or can be used to compare likely impacts of onedecision versus another. Since all models are approximations of realitythey must be interpreted at such, bearing in mind their imperfectrepresentation of physical processes and the assumptions involved inspecifying model parameters and required input information. Estimatesof these can be made from the literature, datasets or other models andsensitivity studies can be used to assess uncertainties. The decisionsinvolved in implementing environmental measures are signiﬁcant. Forinstance, increasing the number of trees could have a diﬀerent outcome(positive or negative) depending on where and how they are plantedand on the species selected. The impact of population growth dependson where and how people will be housed: increasing building heightwas found to have a much smaller impact than increasing buildingextent due to the important role of vegetated surfaces in moderating theurban climate. Compact cities may also oﬀer advantages in terms ofreduced transport demand (Mills, 2007). The results show that changesin land cover can have major impacts on urban energy partitioning,with the biggest changes tending to occur in the least vegetated areaswhere heat stress is greatest. In recent years, trends in gardencomposition (i.e. decisions taken by residents) have resulted in moreFig. 11. As for Fig. 9 but for scenario 5.

Humanbehaviour has a considerable impact on the environment, particularlyin very densely populated areas. However, it should not be overlookedthat uncertainties are also greatest for such areas, where ﬂuxes can varydramatically over short temporal and spatial scales and observationsare scarce.This paper demonstrates how the biophysical SUEWS model can beused to assess the response of the urban climate across a city to variousurban development and climate mitigation measures. SUEWS has thecapability to use more detailed information when available, forexample through consultation with city planners. We describe theapproaches taken to convert readily available datasets to the inputsrequired by the model, with the intention that analyses could beperformed at other sites using a similar methodology. In terms of urbandesign, this study highlights the following:• (Well-watered) vegetation is a key control on urban energy parti-tioning and important for moderating elevated urban temperatures• Consequently, building upwards has a smaller impact on the urbanenergy balance than building on vegetated areas• Adding vegetation has greatest impact in sparsely vegetated areas• A range of meteorological conditions should be considered whenassessing the impact of scenarios.This study overcomes two limitations often encountered whenassessing impacts of urban planning scenarios: few models respond tothe range of controls assessed here (e.g. surface cover, populationdensity, energy use, building properties); and many studies focus onlyon a few days due to high computational demands. Furthermore,SUEWS has also been evaluated against energy balance observationsin a range of cities. Although model results must be interpreted withcare, especially when pertaining to diﬀerent conditions than those forwhich the model has been evaluated, ongoing evaluation work willextend the range of conditions and locations for which the modelbehaviour can be understood. Model development currently underwayshould improve the capabilities and accuracy of SUEWS, particularly interms of the storage and anthropogenic heat ﬂux.This study focuses mainly on the risk of heat stress (with someconsideration of hydrology through the water balance, although thewater balance has not yet been thoroughly evaluated in the UK). Thereare also many other environmental factors to consider, such as airquality, noise pollution and biodiversity (beyond the scope of thecurrent study), as well as economic and social factors. To analysebiophysical exposure risk in conjunction with social vulnerability(Birkmann et al., 2015; Birkmann &Welle, 2015), these results couldbe combined with socio-economic data.The SUEWS model is available to download from http://micromet.reading.ac.uk.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by NERC/Belmont TRUC NE/L008971/1and Newton Fund/Met Oﬃce CSSP China.

Meteorological forcing data from WFDEIThe WFDEI dataset (WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied toERA-Interim data) (Weedon et al., 2011, 2014) is used to provide themeteorological data required for SUEWS: incoming shortwave radiation(K↓), air temperature (Tair), relative humidity (RH), barometric pressure(p), wind speed (U) and precipitation (P). Continuous, long-termobservational datasets of these variables at sub-daily resolution areextremely rare due to the diﬃculties of siting instrumentation in urbanenvironments and the workload involved in maintaining high-qualitymeasurements over an extended period. The WFDEI dataset has globalcoverage (0.5° × 0.5° resolution) and is available at 3-h intervals forthe years 1979–2012, allowing analysis of past weather events.Although Greater London covers about 4 half-degree grid boxes,WFDEI data extracted for the central location of the URB site (51.51° N0.12° W) are used, i.e. each borough uses the same meteorologicalforcing data. Diﬀerences between the 4 grid boxes were minor; here thesingle URB grid was chosen to simplify the comparison with observeddata.SUEWS requires input data at 60 min (which are linearly down-scaled at the outset to the time-step of the model, here 5 min).Therefore, all variables are ﬁrst linearly interpolated from the 3-hWDFEI data to 60 min, except 3-h rainfall which is downscaled directlyto 5 min accounting for the intermittency of wet periods and conservingthe total mass in each 3-h period (Table A1).Using WFDEI data in place of observations (usually at 1-h resolu-tion) can introduce errors (i) through interpolation of 3-h to 1-h dataand (ii) as a result of diﬀerences between what the WFDEI and observeddataset represent, namely the height (see Table A1 for WFDEI; 49.6 mfor URB), elevation (78 m for WFDEI; 10.7 m for URB) and land use.To investigate (i), observations from URB (1 h) are averaged to 3 hto represent the resolution of the WFDEI data according to Table A1.That is, K↓ is the average of the previous 3 h; Tair, RH, p and U areinstantaneous values (approximated here by the mean for the currenthour and for the following hour). This 3-h dataset is then downscaled to1 h in the same way as for the WFDEI dataset and compared to theoriginal 1-h observations (Fig. A1). The assumption that the variableschange linearly in time results in some scatter, particularly for K↓ whichcan change dramatically over hourly time scales. The diurnal cycle of K↓is also slightly widened and ﬂattened (not shown). The impact on theother variables is small and generally makes no appreciable diﬀerenceto the model output.More substantial diﬀerences are found between WFDEI and OBSdatasets (Fig. A2). K↓OBS is smaller than K↓W1h (mean values for daytimeare 195.7 W m−2 (at URB) and 220.2 W m−2 in 2012). To some extent,this is expected due to attenuation by aerosols over central London (seeSection 4.1), but comparison between WFDEI and OBS data for the SUBsite also revealed overestimation by WFDEI. Other diﬀerences whichmay be partly attributable to the urban setting of the observationsinclude slightly warmer observed temperatures at night and lowerobserved relative humidity.

Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161157ment height contribute to small diﬀerences between the datasets,evident in the oﬀset between pOBS and pW1h; the inﬂuence of heightdiﬀerences and urban roughness on wind speed is more complicated.However, the impact of these diﬀerences in Tair, p and U on the modeloutput is very small and no attempt is made to adjust the WFDEI values.For locations in mountainous areas, it is advisable to check whether theelevation of the grid square is comparable to that of the study site, or ifadjustments may be required Kokkonen et al., 2017).A major diﬀerence occurs in the precipitation data, with the WFDEIdataset considerably wetter than OBS at both URB and SUB. In 2012,annual rainfall according to WFDEI (858 mm) is slightly larger than theobserved total (821 mm at URB). According to OBS, rainfall occurs for11% of the hourly periods; for the interpolated WFDEI dataset the valueis 25%. The diﬀerence is also apparent in the original 3-h WFDEIdataset (18% compared to 29% of 3-h periods have rain). This increasedfrequency and volume of rainfall leads to an overestimation of modelledevaporation.Out of the meteorological driving variables, SUEWS is mostsensitive to P, K↓ and RH (as also found by Kokkonen et al. (2017)).For the sites and years considered here, using WFDEI data instead ofobserved forcing leads to an overestimation in Q* and hence ΔQS, butthe change in QH and QE is less signiﬁcant because the eﬀects ofoverestimated P and K↓ are partly compensated for by the overestima-tion of RH. For URB in 2012, using WFDEI data instead of observedforcing leads to an overestimation of about 20 W m−2 in Q* comparedto observations; the eﬀect on QH and QE is smaller (< 7 W m−2and<5 W m−2 respectively).Appendix B. Calculation of coeﬃcients for anthropogenic heatﬂux modelCoeﬃcients for the simple anthropogenic heat ﬂux model (Eq. (2))have been derived for several locations: North American cities(Sailor & Vasireddy, 2006), suburbs of Vancouver (Järvi et al., 2011),cold-climate cities of Helsinki and Montreal (Järvi et al., 2014), and atthe URB and SUB sites Ward et al. (2016a). These coeﬃcients diﬀer, inpart due to variation in building standards (i.e. insulation), energy use(e.g. air conditioning) and land use (residential, commercial, institu-tional). To calculate appropriate coeﬃcients for use across London, theGreaterQF model (Iamarino et al., 2012) is used. As the most recentGreaterQF data are for 2008, the WFDEI air temperature for 2008 areused to calculate heating and cooling degree days, with a base humancomfort temperature of 18.2 °C (Sailor & Vasireddy, 2006). Mean dailyQF is compared with mean daily temperature, and the coeﬃcients aF0,1,2ﬁtted for each borough (Fig. B1). As the data suggest minimal use of airconditioning (i.e. little increase in QF at high temperatures), inaccordance with expectations for the UK, aF1 is set to zero. Thepopulation density is taken as the mean of resident and workdayvalues. Using resident/workday population densities alone gave muchlarger/smaller aF0 and aF2 values for inner boroughs, particularly thosewith contrasting day and night populations, whereas the mean gave asmaller range of aF0 and aF2 values and fewer extreme values.Values of aF0 and aF2 are consistently higher for weekdays thanweekends. aF0 ranged from 0.1134/0.1073 W m−2 (cap ha−1)−1 onweekdays/weekends to 0.2281/0.2119 W m−2 (cap ha−1)−1. aF2 ran-ged from 0.0038/0.0034 W m−2 K−1 (cap ha−1)−1 on weekdays/weekends to 0.0076/0.0069 W m−2 K−1 (cap ha−1)−1. In both cases,the lowest values are for Hackney and the highest for Hillingdon. Nosubstantial diﬀerence is found between inner and outer boroughs, sothe mean of the individual borough values is used for all model grids(Table B1). These values are slightly bigger than obtained for SUB andmuch smaller than for URB (Ward, Kotthaus et al., 2016), which isunsurprising given the characteristics of the observation sites relative tothe boroughs. Note, Ward et al. (2016a) used Westminster boroughpopulation density (204.58 ha−1) for URB. As the URB site is particu-larly densely built up, the borough average ρpop is likely an under-estimation for this area which would explain the very large aF0 valuesobtained.Building energy use is the greatest source of QF, contributing anaverage of 79% of the total, less in spring/summer more in autumn/winter (Fig. B2). Values range between 67% (Havering) and 92% (Cityof London). The vehicle contribution ranges from 6% (City of London)to 28% (Havering) with an average contribution of 15%. Humanmetabolism contributes between 2% (City of London) and 7% (Haver-ing), with an average of 6%. Although building energy use variessubstantially with temperature, the overall composition of QF is fairlyconstant throughout the year and QF is much lower in summer thanwinter.For scenario 5, a 10% reduction in vehicle use is approximated byreducing aF0 by 0.10 × 0.15 = 1.5%. A 20% reduction in buildingenergy use is approximated by reducing aF0 and aF2 by0.20 × 0.79 = 15.8%. The resultant adjusted coeﬃcients for scenario5 are aF0 = 0.1346/0.1260 W m−2 (cap ha−1)−1 and aF2 = 0.0045/0.0041 W m−2 K−1 (cap ha−1)−1 for weekdays/weekends. For scenar-io 3, aF0 was reduced to 0.1457/0.1384 W m−2 (cap ha−1)−1 forweekdays/weekends. These values were derived by ﬁtting toGreaterQF data with the vehicle contribution halved. If instead, theapproximation had been to reduce aF0 by 0.5 × 15%= 7.5%, slightlylarger values of 0.1505 and 0.1409 W m−2 (cap ha−1)−1 would havebeen obtained; this diﬀerence is mainly due to the variation in buildingenergy use with temperature.Appendix C. Estimating change in building density withpopulation growthPopulation growth for scenario 4 is based on GLA (2014) projec-tions. To house this additional population, it is assumed that an increasein building density is required. For scenarios 4ii-iii additional buildingsare constructed on available land (i.e. vegetated and bare soil surfaces).To estimate the change in the surface cover fraction of buildingsrequired, data from the base run are used to derive a relation betweenthe fraction of buildings and population density (Fig. C1). From thisrelation (ﬁtted to the solid circles in Fig. C1), the change in modelledbuilding fraction between the current and projected population iscalculated and added to the current building fraction to give the newbuilding fraction (empty circles).The non-linear equation accounts for the changing relation betweenbuilding fraction and population density: as population density in-creases buildings are taller and living space decreases. However, this isa simplistic approach. The relation should not be used for very lowpopulation densities (below 10.5 ha−1 it returns fbuildings < 0). The ﬁt isbased on the mean of day- and night-time populations, so includesworkers and residents, and the fraction of all buildings, so includesresidential, commercial, industrial and institutional buildings.Therefore, the estimated change in fbuildings includes new homes, placesof work and services in an approximate sense, but these are notexplicitly accounted for (nor their varying composition betweenboroughs). Furthermore, only the change in building fraction has beenestimated; no additional roads or gardens are considered.Instead of building horizontally, scenario 4iv considers the casewhere land cover fractions are unchanged but the new buildings areconstructed vertically (i.e. new ﬂoors added to existing building areas)so mean building height increases. To estimate the new mean buildingheight, the current mean building height is multiplied by the ratio ofH.C. Ward, C.S.B. Grimmond Landscape and Urban Planning 165 (2017) 142–161158Fig. B1.
