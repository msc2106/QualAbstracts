ABSTRACT: 
Against a background of shrinking new homes and forebodings of “rabbit hutch Britain”, the relationship between size of living space and subjective well-being has never been more topical in the UK. Using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and fixed effects regressions, this paper is the first to examine this relationship comprehensively. Two pathways are proposed between space and subjective well-being. First, space facilitates values and activities. Second, space signals wealth which in turn influences social status. It is proposed that wealth is a more important determinant of status for men than women, and that pathway two is therefore gendered. Part one of the paper examines the effect of a change in number of rooms per person on housing satisfaction and subjective well-being in the BHPS as a whole. Despite having a similar effect on the housing satisfaction of both genders, an increase in living space has only a (weak) positive linear effect on the life satisfaction and mental health of men. This suggests that space affects subjective well-being through pathway two, status. Part two of the paper tracks the housing satisfaction and subjective well-being over time of those individuals who move for “larger accommodation”. Consistent with various theories of adaptation, housing satisfaction increases in the year of the move; then decreases slightly before levelling out. Moving for “larger accommodation” has no positive impact on subjective well-being. Overall the results imply a weak positive relationship between size of living space and subjective well-being, but only for men.

This relationship is particularly topical in the UK, where new homes arethe smallest in Western Europe (Evans and Hartwich 2005). Concern has arisen becausesize of living space is important to people. Individuals who report a shortage of space aremore likely to state a preference to move (Fujiwara 2014), and a shortage of space is themain reason for people in new homes wanting to make changes, or considering movinghome (Robert-Hughes 2011).There is quantitative evidence supporting an association between space and well-being(e.g. Reynolds 2005) but a striking absence of quantitative evidence supporting a causalrelationship. Using the British Household Panel Study (BHPS), Pevalin et al. (2008) andFujiwara (2014) both found housing problems to be detrimental to subjective well-being,yet neither found subjectively reported ‘‘shortage of space’’ to have an impact. Thisabsence represents the rationale for examining the magnitude and direction of thisrelationship.Shrinking of living spaces in the UK is generally attributed to the growing cost ofdevelopable land (Evans 1991). However, Tunstall (2015) and Dorling (2014) both arguethat inequality also plays a role. Since the 1980’s distribution of living space has becomeincreasingly unequal. This could explain why the average new home has decreased in size.To test whether a more equal distribution of housing would make for a happier society, wemust examine the shape of the relationship between space and subjective well-being. If anextra room brings more happiness to an individual in a 1-bedroom house than a 5-bedroomhouse, it follows that there is a utilitarian justification for a more equal distribution ofspace.The value of size of living space as a metric of social well-being also depends on thedynamic relationship between size of living space and subjective well-being. Standardeconomic theory implies that any increase in subjective well-being caused by an increasein living space should be sustained over time. In contrast, adaptation theories variouslyimply that changes in living space lead to an initial impact on subjective well-being butthat as individuals adapt, their well-being reverts to its previous level. Adaptation theoriesthus imply that space is a less important metric of societal well-being, as it has only atemporary effect on well-being. Together these diverse bodies of literature motivate thefollowing research questions;‘‘What is the relationship between size of living space and subjective well-being interms of magnitude, direction and shape?’’‘‘Does the relationship differ over time?’’2 Literature Review and TheoryOur first task is to define subjective well-being. Subjective well-being has both an eval-uative (cognitive/judgemental) component, and an experiential (emotional/affective)component (Pavot and Diener 1993). An individual eating a chocolate bar may be happybut dissatisfied with life, while a husband caring for his wife may be unhappy but satisfiedC. Foye123with life. When assessed, these components are at least moderately correlated (Pavot andDiener 1993). In our analysis, we use indicators for both components and, in the absence ofany literature to suggest otherwise, assume both components move together.2.1 Pathways from Size of Living Space to Subjective Well-BeingOnce there is sufficient space so as not to directly jeopardise physical health, this papertheorises two pathways through which size of living space is positively related to sub-jective well-being; through facilitating activities and values, and through status.2.1.1 Pathway 1: Facilitating Activities and ValuesAn increase in living space (ceteris paribus) represents an increase in liberty. In the UK,for example, having friends round, sitting in peace and quiet and eating as a family are allactivities limited by lack of space (Robert-Hughes 2011). By facilitating these activities,one would expect more space to lead to higher well-being. However, in a wider universalcontext, more space could be potentially damaging to well-being. Take the case of theGhates in V.S. Naipaul’s portrait of India;‘‘Mr Ghate was a high senior official. He had grown up in the mill area, in one roomin a chattel, though it was open to him, as a man of position, to live in betteraccommodation in a better area. He had tried to do that some years before, but it hadended badly. His wife had suffered in the comparative seclusion and spaciousness ofthe self contained apartment they had moved to. This was more than moodiness, shehad become seriously disturbed. Mr Ghate had moved back to a chattel, to the tworooms he had now, back to the sense of a surrounding crowd and the sounds of life allaround him, and he was happy again’’ (p. 60)In this case, the increased space (and new surroundings) added options for the Ghates interms of facilitating more activities but took away the option of experiencing a vibranthomelife. In most cases, moving to larger accommodation is likely to involve a similartrade-off. Nonetheless, given that shortage of space is the subject of so many complaints inthe UK (Robert-Hughes 2011), we would expect more space to lead to higher subjectivewell-being but with diminishing marginal effect. In other words, an increase from 1 roomper person to 2 rooms per person is likely to facilitate more activities and values than anincrease from 2 rooms per person to 3 rooms per person.2.1.2 Pathway 2: Status‘‘A house may be large or small; as long as the neighbouring houses are likewisesmall, it satisfies all social requirements for a residence. But let there arise next to thelittle house a palace, and the little house shrinks to a hut’’ (Marx and Engels 1965)The second pathway through which size of living space could influence subjective well-being is status. There is strong evidence of a causal relationship between status andsubjective well-being. For example, Luttmer (2004) found individual life satisfaction to benegatively related to neighbours’ income. See also Clark (2003) and Ferrer-i-Carbonell(2005). As Hirsch (2005) and Amartya Sen (1983) have pointed out, being concerned aboutstatus is rational as having high relative standing is a factor in the realization of numerouslegitimate human objectives. One determinant of status is relative wealth. Relative wealthThe Relationship Between Size of Living Space and…123signifies one’s ability (Frank 2007) and power over others (Csikszentmihalyi andRochberg-Halton 1981). By engaging in conspicuous consumption (Veblen 1899) one cansignal their wealth to others. A house is the largest and most expensive physical objectmost individuals consume, and size is one of the main determinants of house value. Thesize of one’s house is therefore a visible indicator of wealth. However, because status isdetermined by relative wealth, what matters is not house size per se but relative house size.Frank (2007) found that most people state a preference for having a 3000 square foot housein a world where everyone else has a 2000 sq ft house, as opposed to having a 4000 sq fthouse in a world where everyone else has a 6000 sq ft house. House size is therefore likelyto be a positional good (Hirsch 2005; Frank 2007), whose utility value depends strongly onthe consumption of others. In short, the relative size of one’s house signals one’s relativewealth, which in turn determines one’s status or social rank, which is important tosubjective well-being. Intuitively one would expect the relationship between size of livingspace and status to be more linear than pathway one. For a single person, moving from a 2bedroom flat to a 3 bedroom flat is unlikely to facilitate many more activities but it willdeliver status by virtue of the higher property value.The policy implications of space influencing subjective well-being through pathway oneand two are entirely different. Pathway one implies that an increase in average levels ofliving space would facilitate more household activities, and therefore increase societalwell-being. Contrastingly, pathway two implies that individuals derive subjective well-being not from having more space in itself, but from having more space than other people.Thus increasing average levels of living space- through minimum space standards, forinstance- is unlikely to have much effect on societal well-being. Instead, it is the distri-bution of living space that matters. According to the logic posited by Frank (2007) andWilkinson and Pickett (2009) a more equal distribution of space would reduce the anxietyand sense of inferiority felt by those at the bottom and middle of the space distribution. Sohow do we distinguish between these pathways? One way is through the shape of therelationship. As noted, pathway two implies a more linear relationship between space andsubjective well-being than pathway one. An additional way is through looking at how therelationship differs between genders.There is substantial quantitative evidence to suggest that economic variables are moreimportant to the status of men than women. Mayraz et al. (2009) found income compar-isons to be a much better predictor of subjective well-being for men than women. Usingeconometric techniques on national panel datasets, Clark (2003), Clark et al. (2010) andShields et al (2009) all found that the subjective well-being of unemployed men rises whenfaced with other people’s unemployment at the regional level. None found any effect forwomen, apart from Clark (2003) who found a weak relationship. Furthermore, there isqualitative evidence that housing means more to men as a symbol of economic status thanit does to women, who instead emphasise the home as a source of social status (Seeleyet al. 1956; Rainwater 1966); and that men use objective terms to describe their homes,whereas women use more subjective terms (Gutmann 1965; Carlson 1971). All of theabove suggests that, as an indicator of wealth, size of living space will matter more for thestatus of men than women. Consequently, pathway two should be stronger for men thanwomen. There does not appear to be any literature to suggest that pathway one will begendered once employment status and hours spent doing housework are controlled for.Therefore, if pathway two is present, we would expect size of living space to have a largereffect on the subjective well-being of men than women.C. Foye1232.2 The Dynamic Aspect of the RelationshipIn the above literature review we discussed the direction, shape and magnitude of therelationship between size of living space and subjective well-being, and how these maydiffer according to (1) gender and (2) the pathways through which space affects subjectivewell-being. It is also important to know whether the relationship varies over time.According to standard economic theory, any increase in subjective well-being in the yearafter an increase in living space should be sustained over time, ceteris paribus. However,several studies have found that increases in housing and life satisfaction associated withmoving house diminish over time, in a process which can be loosely defined as adaptation.Using Australian Panel Data, Frijters et al. (2011) found a positive effect of moving house(for all reasons) on life satisfaction but this effect lasted for 6 months only. Nakazato et al.(2011) examined the effect of moving for housing related reasons on the life satisfactionand housing satisfaction of 3658 participants in the German Socio-Economic Panel. In thisscenario, moving house led to an increase in housing satisfaction but this was only partiallysustained over the 5 years post-move. They found no effect on life satisfaction. Findlayand Nowok (2012) examined the trajectories of different domain satisfaction judgementsafter internal migration in the BHPS and similarly found housing satisfaction to take adownward post-move trajectory. The exception is Nowok et al. (2013), who found noevidence of adaptation in life satisfaction judgements. Again using the BHPS, they foundthat moving house (for any reason) was preceded by a period when individuals experienceda significant decline in life satisfaction. Moving house brought life satisfaction back toinitial levels where they remained for the next 5 years (and perhaps longer). Their findingsare therefore more consistent with standard economic theory.The post-move downward trajectories of housing satisfaction and subjective well-beingare consistent with adaptation theory (or set point theory), which contends that individualshave stable levels of subjective well-being shaped by genetics and personality. Deviationsfrom the set-points may occur but their effects are usually transitory. However, asNakazato et al. (2011) point out, adaptation theory is limited as it does not explain whythese effects are transitory. There are two explanations—as follows- for why the increasein housing satisfaction after an improvement in living conditions is not sustained.First, according to the aspiration spiral theory (Stutzer, 2004), after improving theirliving conditions, individuals could simply shift their expectations upwards; ‘‘now I have a3 bedroom house, I want a 4 bedroom house.’’ (Nakazato et al. 2011). Housing satisfactionjudgements are generally thought to be constructed by individuals according to how theircurrent housing situation relates to their preferred housing situation (Galster and Hesser1981). For alternative theories of housing satisfaction, see Jansen (2014). According to thislogic, an increase in living space will initially close the gap between one’s preferredhousing situation and reality, leading to an initial increase in housing satisfaction. But overtime this gap will re-emerge causing any uplift in housing satisfaction to diminish. Whilehousing preferences can be influenced by ‘‘relevant others’’ (Vera-Toscano and Ateca-Amestoy 2008), theoretically the aspiration spiral theory need not involve socialcomparisons.The second explanation for the post-move decrease in housing satisfaction is distinctionbias (Hsee and Zhang 2004). In the year after moving to larger accommodation, indi-viduals view their new house in direct comparison to their old house in a joint evaluation,so space is particularly salient. Over time, however, the new house will be viewed inisolation in a separate evaluation. Because space is not a naturally salient housingThe Relationship Between Size of Living Space and…123characteristic (i.e. it is not intrusive or unpredictable), its salience will decrease, andhousing satisfaction judgements will diminish accordingly.Housing satisfaction is not an indicator of subjective well-being itself. But according tothe theoretical model of Van Praag et al. (2003), life satisfaction judgements are a functionof different domain satisfaction judgements. Thus housing conditions affect housing sat-isfaction, which in turn affects life satisfaction. Because subjective well-being is a functionof housing satisfaction, it should take a similar (although smoother) trajectory over timei.e. decrease before the move; increase in the year after the move; and decrease thereafter.However, it may be that space influences subjective well-being independently ofhousing satisfaction. According to the hedonic treadmill theory, novel stimuli are morelikely to lead to positive/negative affect as they are more likely to draw attention(Schimmack 2001; Wilson and Gilbert 2008). Initially more space will lead to an increasein positive affect, which will be reflected in higher experiential and evaluative well-being(Schimmack et al. 2002b). Over time, however, the novelty will wear off and subjectivewell-being will return to its previous levels. The hedonic treadmill theory does not predictadaptation in housing satisfaction judgements as these should not be influenced by posi-tive/negative affect (Nakazato et al. 2011).Alternatively, the influence of housing satisfaction judgements on subjective well-beingmay change throughout the moving process. It is in the interest of an individual’s sub-jective well-being to place more emphasis on those life domains that most satisfy them.This is formally demonstrated by Bradford and Dolan (2010), in what they define as theglobal adaptive utility model. According to their model, the importance of housing shouldincrease when levels of housing satisfaction increase, and decrease when housing satis-faction decreases. Therefore decreases in housing satisfaction should have little influenceon life satisfaction judgements. Contrastingly, increases in housing satisfaction should beamplified in life satisfaction judgements.Summarising, the existing literature predicts that size of living space will be positivelyrelated to subjective well-being and housing satisfaction. Pathway one implies the rela-tionship will have diminishing marginal utility, whereas pathway two implies a more linearrelationship. The literature on gender suggests that if pathway two exists, space shouldhave a larger impact on men’s subjective well-being. In terms of the dynamic relationship,distinction bias and aspiration spiral theory both imply that any increase in housing sat-isfaction associated with moving to larger accommodation will diminish post-move.According to Van Praag et al. (2003), subjective well-being should take a similar, althoughsmoother, trajectory to housing satisfaction. In contrast, the global adaptive utility modeland the hedonic treadmill theory both imply that subjective well-being will take a differenttrajectory to housing satisfaction. It is therefore important that we look at the effect ofspace on subjective well-being, and housing satisfaction separately.3 Data and MethodologyThere are two parts to the analysis. The first uses fixed effect regressions to identify howchanges in number of rooms per person affects housing satisfaction and subjective well-being. The second examines the dynamic housing satisfaction and subjective well-being ofthose individuals who move to subjectively larger accommodation. For both parts, data isused from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) covering the period 1991–2008,including booster samples. The data used in this paper were extracted using the Add-OnC. Foye123package PanelWhiz v4.0 (Oct 2012) for Stata. PanelWhiz was written by Dr. John P.Haisken-DeNew (john@panelwhiz.eu). The PanelWhiz generated DO file to retrieve theGSOEP data used here and any Panelwhiz Plugins are available upon request. Any data orcomputational errors in this paper are my own. Haisken-DeNew and Hahn (2010) describePanelWhiz in detail.To capture the evaluative component of subjective well-being, we use life satisfaction.Life satisfaction judgements correlate well with other people’s views, behavioural data,brain activity and objective characteristics such as rates of depression (Layard 2005). Lifesatisfaction is measured using responses to the question of ‘‘How dissatisfied or satisfiedare you with your life overall?’’, with responses on a scale of 1–7, where 1 signifiescompletely dissatisfied and 7 signifies completely satisfied. The experiential component ofsubjective well-being is proxied for using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). TheGHQ is widely used in medical, psychological, and sociological research, and is consid-ered to be a robust indicator of the individual’s psychological state (Clark 2003). The GHQasks individuals (via a self-completion questionnaire) how often they are experiencingcertain feelings (e.g. happiness, strain, depression, lack of confidence) in relation to theirusual state; ‘‘Not at all’’, ‘‘No more than usual’’, ‘‘Rather more than usual’’, and ‘‘Muchmore than usual’’. The Caseness version of the GHQ score is used, which counts thenumber of questions for which the response is in one of the two ‘low subjective well-being’categories. Higher scores therefore indicate lower levels of subjective well-being. For easeof interpretation, the scales are reversed (i.e. 12 = 0…,0 = 12) after which the majority ofrespondents record a score of 12. Clark and Georgellis (2013) found trajectories of GHQand Life Satisfaction to be very similar after life events (e.g. widowhood, marriage,unemployment). Housing satisfaction is evaluated using responses to the question; ‘‘Howdissatisfied or satisfied are you with………Your house/flat’’, with responses again on ascale of 1–7. Both housing satisfaction and life satisfaction were included every year from1996 onwards with the exception of 2001. GHQ was included in every year.For part one of the analysis, which is concerned with examining the magnitude, di-rection and shape of the relationship, a fixed effects model is adopted. The two indicatorsof subjective well-being and housing satisfaction are rotated as dependent variables, andseparate regressions are run for males and females. Thus part one consists of a total of sixregressions. Space is measured using rooms per person (number of rooms excludingkitchen and bathrooms/household size). We assume that, on average, when an individualreports an increase (or decrease) in rooms per person, this represents an increase (ordecrease) in overall living space. The descriptive statistics support this case. In the BHPSsample, there is a negative correlation (-0.26) between rooms per person and an individualreporting a shortage of space. Of those individuals who report moving for larger accom-modation (5 year sample), 83 % report an increase in number of rooms, and only 6 %report a decrease.Number of persons in the household is also controlled for separately. Therefore, thecoefficients on ‘rooms per person’ indicate the effect of size of living space, keepinghousehold size constant. Other control variables include variables that have been found toinfluence subjective well-being in the past; housing and environmental variables besidesspace e.g. damp; hypothesised costs associated with larger accommodation such as timespent commuting and doing housework. Furthermore, this study is the first to examine theeffect of housing conditions on subjective well-being while controlling for ‘neighbourhoodeffects’. If we were to find a positive relationship between rooms per person and subjectivewell-being, it could be argued that this relationship is actually driven by neighbourhoodeffects i.e. increases (or decreases) in living space are associated with moving to a betterThe Relationship Between Size of Living Space and…123(or worse) area- in terms of crime rates, schools, green areas etc. and it is these neigh-bourhood variables which explain the positive relationship between size of living spaceand subjective well-being. By including multiple deprivation statistics at the lower levelsuper output area (SOA)—each of which contain approximately 1500 people according tofigures from 2004 (ODPM 2004)—we can control for these potentially confoundingneighbourhood effects. Because these statistics are not comparable across UK nations, partone of the analysis is limited to England. All control variables are listed and categorised in‘‘Appendix 1’’. For all regressions conducted, standard errors are clustered at the individuallevel to account for any serial correlation.In order to test for a linear relationship, all models are first tested with only ‘rooms perperson’. Then a quadratic interaction term is introduced (rooms per person squared) to testfor non-linearity e.g. diminishing marginal utility. Results from the two specifications(with and without interaction term) are compared by examining the coefficient on ‘roomsper person’. If this coefficient is more statistically significant with the quadratic term, thanwithout, or the quadratic term itself is statistically significant, the relationship is deemednon-linear.Part two of the analysis examines the dynamic aspect of the relationship. Morespecifically, it assesses the movement over time of subjective well-being and housingsatisfaction, for individuals who move house and cite ‘‘larger accommodation’’ as theirreason for moving. This yields a smaller sample size than part one that is less represen-tative of the population because only certain types of individuals can, or want to, move tolarger accommodation. The benefits are threefold. First, we can track the housing satis-faction and subjective well-being for movers over time. Second, the context surroundingthe change in living space is more uniform, meaning we can more accurately identifyspurious influences on subjective well-being. Third, we can test whether the effects ofspace on well-being are asymmetrical. For example, in part one, an increase in space mayhave a positive effect on subjective well-being, but a decrease in space may have no effect.By looking only at upsizers we may uncover a positive effect that is offset in part one.In part two, a series of appropriate ‘year relative to move dummies’ are included in afixed-effects regression to examine how the time relative to a move affects housing sat-isfaction and subjective well-being. This model has been used extensively for different lifeevents (e.g. Clark and Georgellis 2013; Nowok et al. 2013). A broadly similar set ofcontrols is used with a few exceptions (see ‘‘Appendix 1’’). Because all of the samplemoved house within nation states, it does not matter (for the interpretation of the coeffi-cients of interest) that multiple deprivation statistics are not comparable across nationstates. Therefore, in the second part of the analysis, individuals from throughout UK areincluded. Neighbourhood effects are controlled for, but only those which are availableacross UK (see ‘‘Appendix 1’’). When GHQ was used as a dependent variable in part two,the results suggested multi-collinearity. Age was identified as the source. Therefore, allpart two regressions are conducted without age as a control.To maximise sample size, and the length of time over which adaptation is tested for, twooverlapping samples are selected. To be included in either sample, an individual must havebeen observed in the same property 1–2 and 0–1 years before the move and have beenobserved in a different property 0–1 years after the move. When individuals reported achange of address, they were asked: ‘‘Did you move for reasons that were wholly or partlyto do with your own job, or employment opportunities?’’ Next, all movers were asked;‘‘What were your (other) main reasons for moving?’’ to which they could reply with up totwo reasons. For an individual to be included in either sample, their first reason 0–1 yearsC.

To be included in the second (smaller) 7 yearsample, they must have been observed in, or reasonably assumed to have been in, the samelarger property in 4 out of 5 of the years post-move. If individuals moved numerous times(in the BHPS) for larger accommodation, only their most recent move for larger accom-modation is selected.In both samples the vast majority ([75 %) of the sample are mortgage holders while10–15 % are public renters. There are very few private renters, presumably because theselection criteria require immobility before and after the move. For both samples, themedian age is 33/34 and the mean household income is approximately £30,000, whichmakes it significantly older (?10 years) and wealthier (?£7000) than the BHPS sample asa whole. For the 5 year sample, the median distance moved was 1.3 km and 77 % ofmoves were less than 5 km, so on average moving is unlikely to have involved thedisruption of social networks beyond those situated within the neighbourhood.On the 5 year sample(s), the model below is adopted;S €WBit ¼ b €Xit þ h1M1;it þ h0M0;it þ h1M1;it þ h2M2;it þ €eit ð1ÞHere, S €WBit stands for deviations from the individual mean of housing satisfaction orsubjective well-being for a particular individual, i, at a certain time, t. X is a vector ofcontrol variables listed in ‘‘Appendix 1’’. Most importantly, there are four dummy vari-ables indicating the year relative to moving house that the individual is observed in. ThusM1;it, is a dummy variable that takes on the value of 1 if the individual is observed up to1 year before the move, and 0 if it is not. The other three duration dummy variables operatein the same way. In all cases, the omitted dummy variable and thus the reference categoryfor all individuals is 1–2 years before the move (M2;it). On the 7 year sample, the sameregression model is used, the only difference being an extra two dummy duration variablesh3M3;it and h4M4;it.4 Results4.1 Part OneA fixed effects regression is concerned with within individual changes; the changes in thevalue of a (dependent/independent) variable that the same individual reports from one yearto the next. The results in Table 1 thus show the relationship between within individualchanges in individual living space and within individual changes in housing satisfaction,life satisfaction and GHQ Caseness (for full results see ‘‘Appendix 2’’). The sample is splitaccording to gender. In interpreting the coefficients for both parts one and two, a one tailt test is used for coefficients whose sign is consistent with prior hypotheses (p\ 0.1), whilea two tail t test is used for coefficients whose sign is the opposite of that hypothesised orwhere no hypotheses exist (p\ 0.05). Space aside, only a few housing variables influencelife satisfaction or GHQ caseness. Poor light and rot both have a negative effect on maleGHQ Caseness. Damp walls have a negative effect on both components of female sub-jective well-being. Almost all housing variables have an impact on housing satisfaction.C. Foye123For both males and females, rooms per person is positively related to housing satisfaction,but with diminishing marginal effect; up to a certain point (3.9 rooms per person for malesand 3.6 for females), space is positively related to housing satisfaction but then the effectwears off. Space is more important to the housing satisfaction of men than women, but onlyslightly. In contrast, the relationship between space and broader subjective well-being islinear and distinctly gendered. For women, space has no effect on life satisfaction, and whenwe introduce a quadratic term space has a negative effect on GHQ caseness.1 For males, spaceis positively and linearly related to both aspects of subjective well-being, but the relationshipsare weak. For a single man, an increase in the number of rooms from 1 to 2 (excludingkitchens and bathrooms) increases life satisfaction by 0.043 (p\ 0.05). Compared to theeffect of major life events, this effect is small. For instance, in the year after marriage, malesexperience an increase in life satisfaction of 0.235 (p\ 0.01) (Clark and Georgellis 2012). Interms of housing, Fujiwara (2014) used the BHPS and found that damp and neighbour noisewere associated with a decrease in life satisfaction of 0.05. Turning to experiential well-being, an increase in one room per person leads to an increase in male GHQ Caseness of 0.11(p\ 0.05), which is approximately half of that reported by males in the year after marriage(0.21; p\ 0.1) (Clark and Georgellis 2012).In summary, although size of living space has a similar effect on the housing satis-faction of men and women, space only has a (weak) positive effect on the subjective well-being of men.4.2 Part TwoPart two tracked the housing satisfaction and subjective well-being of individuals beforeand after moving to subjectively larger accommodation. The descriptive statistics of the 5and 7 year samples can be seen below in Table 2.In line with the sample requirements—that all individuals must be observed in the2 years pre-move and first year post-move- the number of observations stays constant inthe first 3 years before decreasing. The median rooms per person for the whole BHPSsample is 1.66. As can be seen in Table 2, individuals upsize to accommodation that isapproximately the population average. The move clearly has the intended effect initially,with the proportion of respondents reporting a shortage of space dropping from 66 to 8 %(5 year sample), but over the next 4 years the proportion reporting a shortage of spacemore than doubles (see 7 year sample). Individuals also move to a better neighbourhood(median multiple deprivation score for 5 year sample in M - 1 = 15.3; M0 = 11.9).The findings for housing satisfaction are concurrent with adaptation, and can be seen inTable 3. For full results, see ‘‘Appendix 3’’. In the year before the move, individuals reporta decrease in housing satisfaction, prompting them to move to larger accommodation. Inthe year after the move, housing satisfaction rises considerably, and is significantly higherthan in the reference year (1–2 years pre-move). In the following years, however, increasesin housing satisfaction diminish. In both samples, post-move increases in housing satis-faction (relative to M - 1) diminish by about 30 % over the 3 years post-move. The7 years sample shows that they stabilise from then on. Despite adaptation, levels ofhousing satisfaction are still significantly higher 4–5 years after the move than they were1–2 years before. It could be that those individuals who dropped out of the sample post-move were less satisfied with their accommodation than those who stayed, leading to post-1 One hypothesis for this result may be that, like Mrs Ghate, women suffer more from the comparativesocial isolation associated with larger living spaces.The Relationship Between Size of Living Space and…123move upward attrition bias. Nevertheless, when samples were limited to individuals whohad stayed in their pre/post move accommodation for all the years relative to move (7/7and 5/5 years), the same pattern of results was observed.In terms of subjective well-being, there is no positive effect of moving to largeraccommodation on GHQ or life satisfaction for either sample. This holds true even whenwe split the 5 year sample according to gender (see ‘‘Appendix 4’’). In fact, when the5 year sample is used, there is a significant negative effect of moving to larger accom-modation on life satisfaction 2–3 years after the move.In summary, moving to larger accommodation leads to an increase in housing satisfaction that ispartially sustained over the 5 years post-move. However, consistent with the findings of Nakazatoet al. (2011) in Germany, this does not translate into an increase in subjective well-being.Table 2 Description of part two samplesSample Number of observationsin sampleMedian rooms perperson% Reporting spaceshortage5 year 7 year 5 year 7 year 5 year 7 year1–2 years pre–move (M - 2) 978 638 1.4 1.33 52 540–1 years pre–move (M - 1) 978 638 1.25 1.25 66 680–1 years post–move (M0) 978 638 1.63 1.63 8 81–2 years post–move (M1) 901 602 1.63 1.63 12 122–3 years post–move (M2) 775 613 1.6 1.5 16 173–4 years post–move (M3) 0 587 N/A 1.5 N/A 204–5 years post–move (M4) 0 515 N/A 1.5 N/A 19Table 3 The effect of moving to larger accommodation over timeVariables Housing satisfaction Life satisfaction GHQ caseness5 year sample 7 year sampleyearmovem1 (M - 1) -0.489*** -0.454*** -0.00981 0.0208 -0.103 -0.227-0.0762 -0.111 -0.0543 -0.0795 -0.149 -0.213yearmove0 (M0) 0.777*** 1.016*** 0.0576 0.126 -0.0346 0.0223-0.0973 -0.128 -0.068 -0.096 -0.19 -0.268yearmove1 (M1) 0.448*** 0.709*** -0.145* -0.12 -0.058 -0.0421-0.107 -0.131 -0.0766 -0.101 -0.218 -0.296yearmove2 (M2) 0.338*** 0.550*** -0.219** -0.167 0.0549 -0.05-0.116 -0.141 -0.0869 -0.112 -0.253 -0.309yearmove3 (M3) 0.509*** -0.0881 -0.14-0.135 -0.121 -0.323yearmove4 (M4) 0.482*** -0.242* -0.287-0.146 -0.128 -0.358Observations 2531 2249 2527 2244 2818 2578R-squared 0.319 0.299 0.064 0.072 0.035 0.058Number of pid 831 613 831 613 833 614p value *\0.1; **\0.05; ***\0.01C. Foye1235 Discussion and Conclusion5.1 Housing SatisfactionPart one showed that space has a positive and diminishing marginal effect on housingsatisfaction for both males and females. This implies that pathway one drives the rela-tionship between space and housing satisfaction. Part two suggests that any positive effectof space on housing satisfaction partially diminishes over time. This could be attributed todistinction bias—space becomes a less salient feature of the accommodation; or aspirationspiral theory—the respondent consciously escalates their space aspirations. Either way,these findings have potentially significant implications for our understanding of thehousing market. In 2008, 8 % of BHPS respondents moved for ‘‘larger accommodation’’.Because housing satisfaction is very influential in determining moving propensities (Diaz-Serrano and Stoyanova 2010), it could be argued that in addition to micro and macrofactors, adaptation in housing satisfaction judgements acts to accelerate movement up thehousing ladder and increases levels of residential mobility.5.2 Subjective Well-BeingDespite finding large increases in housing satisfaction, part two found no positive effect ofmoving to larger accommodation on subjective well-being. This supports neither thehedonic treadmill theory, nor the global adaptive utility model. It could simply be that therelationship between space and well-being is not strong enough for these moves to result ina significant increase in subjective well-being. On average individuals in the 5 year sampleonly increased their number of rooms per person by 0.38. According to part one, thisincrease would only lead to a very small increase in subjective well-being, which mayrequire a larger sample size to be identified. However, the negative effect on life satis-faction 2–3 years after the move suggests that there are costs associated with moving housethat we have not controlled for. Perhaps these offset the benefits associated with moving.The distances moved were small so disruption of social networks is unlikely to be thereason. It could be that the relative unfamiliarity of the new house and immediateneighbourhood results in a loss of identity and ontological security. Alternatively, therelationship between size of living space and subjective well-being may be asymmetricali.e. decreases in space may lead to decreases in subjective well-being but increases in spacemay not lead to increases in subjective well-being.Part one yields the most interesting findings on the relationship between size of livingspace and subjective well-being. It produces two pieces of evidence to suggest thatpathway two (status) drives the relationship between space and subjective well-being, butindependently of housing satisfaction.First, in contrast to the relationship between space and housing satisfaction which isnon-linear, the relationship between space and subjective well-being is linear. This impliesthat space affects housing satisfaction through pathway one- which should have dimin-ishing marginal utility- but affects subjective well-being through pathway two, which wewould expect to be more linear.Second, the relationship between space and well-being is gendered. The existing literatureindicates that pathway two should be stronger for men than women. We find that size of livingspace impacts on the housing satisfaction of both genders similarly, but that it has a (weak)The Relationship Between Size of Living Space and…123positive impact only on the subjective well-being of men.2 If pathway two is the dominant(and gendered) driver of the relationship between space and subjective well-being, butoperates independently of housing satisfaction, then this would reconcile our findings withthe existing literature i.e. it maybe that men recognise the extra values and activities that alarge house facilitates by reporting higher housing satisfaction, but not the extra social statusthat it affords. Perhaps men do not attribute the sense of pride and confidence associated withhigh status, to the size of their living space. In short, pathway two may be too distal andindirect for men to appreciate the role of house size. Consequently, housing satisfaction mayonly partially reflect the true relationship between housing and subjective well-being.If pathway two is the main driver of the relationship between space and subjective well-being—and part one only provides suggestive evidence that it is—then this would imply thatsize of living space is a positional good. Individuals are deriving subjective well-being fromhaving more space than other people, as opposed to having more space in itself. In this case,minimum space standards are unlikely to have much effect on societal well-being in the UK,as what matters is the distribution of living space, rather than absolute levels of living space.As Wilkinson and Pickett (2009) state, ‘‘Greater inequality seems to heighten people’s socialevaluation anxieties by increasing the importance of social status’’(pp. 33–34). A more equaldistribution of living space could reduce the anxiety of those with relatively low levels ofspace, and mitigate conspicuous consumption of (green) space that arises from invidioussocial comparisons (see Frank 2007 for an economist’s version of this argument). However,in working towards greater societal well-being, policy makers also ought to recognise that,like well-being, liberty may also be an intrinsic good (see Sen 2009; Chapter 13 for rea-soning). Ceteris paribus, a large house which allows a family to eat together is arguablypreferable to a small one that does not, even this capability is not exercised. Similarly,policies that infringe on individual liberty like the ‘bedroom tax’ need to offer significanttangible benefits in terms of societal well-being in order to represent societal progress.The fixed effects methodology adopted by this paper, together with the rich set of controlvariables, provides us with the best insight to date into the causal relationship between size ofliving space and subjective well-being. However, there remains a risk of reverse causality: malesmay become happier and therefore buy a larger house (or build an extension), rather than thereverse relationship as we have proposed. Future research could resolve this issue by looking forcases where individuals are randomly assigned increases (or decreases) in living space. Even ifthe endogeneity issue is resolved, however, it will still be unclear which pathway is dominant inthe relationship between space and subjective well-being. Our evidence suggests pathway twobut future research should explicitly test for these pathways. Research on the effect of relativeincome on subjective well-being provides a good starting point. Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005) andLuttmer (2004) have both used panel data to look at how ‘relevant others’’ income affectsindividual subjective well-being. If pathway two exists then a man’s subjective well-being shoulddepend not only on how much space he has, but also how much space ‘relevant others’ have.Due to its exploratory nature, this paper raises many questions for future research. If a largecomponent of the relationship between housing and subjective well-being operates indepen-dently of housing satisfaction judgements, as our findings suggest, then where is the value inmeasuring housing satisfaction? Future psychological research should address this issue by2 It could be argued that only men benefit from increases in living space, because it is mostly men whomake the decision to increase their living space, while women must simply follow. However, in this case, wewould expect more men than women to report a shortage of space in the year prior to moving to largeraccommodation. In fact, in the part two 5 year sample, a higher proportion of women (70 %) stated ashortage of space in M - 1, than men (64 %).C. Foye123looking at the effect of housing factors on housing satisfaction and subjective well-being,respectively. This paper has also limited its scope to adults. The effect of space on children(through educational performance and status) may be stronger, and apply across both genders(Solari and Mare 2012). Moreover, this paper has only looked at well-being at the individuallevel. Future research should examine well-being at the collective/household level, whereinteractions between the different actors in the household are likely to moderate the rela-tionship (Hagan et al. 1996). The relationship should also be explored in other cultural con-texts. In more collectivistic and equal countries, housing maybe less of a status symbol, andpathway one may be more dominant in determining subjective well-being.This paper does not purport to provide definitive answers to all the topical and complexissues surrounding the relationship between size of living space and subjective well-being,but hopefully does provide a useful platform for further empirical research.Acknowledgments I am enormously grateful to David Clapham, Tommaso Gabrieli and Sarah Jewell fortheir guidance thoughout.
