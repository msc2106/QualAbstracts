ABSTRACT: 
The Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees is central to scholar-ship on refugee and asylum issues. It is the primary basis upon which asylumseekers make their claims to the majority of host states today and, as a key text ofthe human rights framework, has come to be associated with the very idea of auniversalised rights-bearing human being. Yet British asylum policy today is char-acterized by efforts to limit access to the right to asylum. Many scholars believe thisis because asylum seekers today are different, in character and number, to previouscohorts of applicants. This article goes back to the founding of the refugee rightsregime and investigates the exclusions of colonized peoples from access to the rightto asylum. Using Chimni’s concept of the “myth of difference”, the article demon-strates that asylum seekers have long existed outside of Europe, and that theirexclusion from international rights has been both longstanding and intentional. Thishistorical sociology suggests that the basis for critical work on the issue of asylumpolicy today must be one which takes colonial histories into account.

FULL TEXT: 
 *****IntroductionA highly restrictive asylum regime has emerged in Britain and other“Western” states in recent decades. While scholars have provideda wide range of explanations for restrictivist policies (for example,Goodwin-Gill 2001, Pirouet 2001, Schuster 2003, Gibney 2004,Hintjens 2006, Clements 2007, Bohmer and Shuman 2008,Haddad 2008), most of these explanations are underpinned by abelief that asylum seekers today are fundamentally different fromprevious cohorts in number and character. Where the former arelarge in number (“unprecedented”) and always non-European, thelatter were small in number (“manageable”) and European. Chimni(1998) labels this underlying assumption the “myth of difference”.Western governments are assumed to have willingly signed up touniversal human rights commitments in the middle of the 20thcentury, only changing their policy approach –backtracking oncommitments made previously- at that point at which flows ofasylum seekers changed fundamentally.* Lucy Mayblin is Postdoctoral Research Associate at the InterdisciplinaryCentre for the Social Sciences, University of Sheffield.

This analysis challenges the “mythof difference” and raises important critical questions about theexclusionary politics of asylum today. The article is based on newarchival research, drawing upon evidence from two main sources.First, British government documents, including those held at theNational Archives: the minutes of Cabinet meetings in conjunctionwith cabinet papers and departmental sources; Hansard recordsof parliamentary debates, and official submissions to, as well aspreparations for, the UN human rights negotiations in the late1940s and early 1950s. Second, evidence drawn from the UNarchives; from the negotiations surrounding the refugee conven-tion, as well as the Declaration of Human Rights, where relevant.Specifically, transcripts of the negotiation meetings, including theUN Ad Hoc Committee on Refugees and Stateless Persons and theUN Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Status of Refugees andStateless Persons. This is then supported by reference to secondarysources.My intention is not to propose that paying attention to historyprovides a singular explanation which invalidates all others.Rather, it is to foreground something which has hitherto beenpaid very little attention in a scholarly field largely focused onthe present and recent past. Where histories of colonialism anddecolonisation appear in the literature, it is often to highlight theirinfluence on those countries and populations who were on thereceiving end of European rule (Marfleet 2006). Yet, as AlbertMemmi ([1957] 2003) has pointed out, colonialism affected colo-nized and colonizer alike. This under-researched area is thereforeripe for exploration.The Refugee Convention and the Myth of DifferenceArticle 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)states that “everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in othercountries asylum from persecution” (United Nations GeneralAssembly 1948). This was the first international document to rec-ognise the universal right to asylum. It was then bolstered by the1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, which was the firstin a succession of legal instruments enshrining the rights of par-ticular groups in international law. Refugee rights are thereforehuman rights, and the convention specifically dealing with themwas being negotiated at the same time as the broader human rights424 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014declaration was being drafted (Hathaway 1990). Negotiationsaround the Refugee Convention, specifically around the refugeedefinition and the territorial applicability of the refugee conventionheavily drew upon the UDHR, as well as the already existing rulesgoverning the European focused International Refugee Organisa-tion. It is therefore necessary to analyse the refugee conventionwith reference to these broader discussions. The human rightsframework was based on the idea that the need for some legalconstraints on a (non-colonised) state’s sovereignty might be nec-essary order to prevent a repeat of the atrocities committed in NaziGermany. The Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees wasthus agreed at a United Nations conference on 25 July 1951 follow-ing three years of discussion. It was ratified in 1954, amended witha new protocol in 1967, and today has 145 signatories.Despite being one of the founding members of the UN and amongthe first to sign the Geneva Convention, Britain today is not awelcoming place for asylum seekers. Since the early 1990s, whenasylum seekers from non-European countries began to increaseas a proportion of all those seeking asylum, great effort has beenexpended on preventing people from seeking refuge from persecu-tion in Britain. As well as preventing asylum seekers from enteringthe country and limiting the numbers granted refugee status,legislation has been passed preventing asylum seekers who domanage to make a claim from working, travelling, or living in a cityof their choosing, and on detaining and deporting the many whoseclaims are unsuccessful back to often unstable countries (Hassan2000, Sales 2002, Bacon 2005, Bloch and Schuster 2005, Welchand Schuster 2005; Gibney 2006, Hintjens 2006, Bohmer andShuman 2008, Squire 2009).A large number of authors attribute the fact that a restrictive,punitive asylum regime has emerged in the UK in recent decadesto the sheer “newness” of the refugees that have been arrivingin Europe since the 1980s. That is, newness in terms of theirnumbers, the reasons for their flight, and the context in which theyhave arrived. A common argument made is that the numbers ofasylum seekers coming to the UK is at a historically unprecedentedhigh. Hansen (2003) writes that “for much of the post-war period,asylum was a Cold War sideshow . . . accepting rare large-scaleoutflows . . . allowed the West to assert, without much financialcost, its moral superiority” (p.35). Then, in the 1980s numbersbegan to increase, after 1989 “they exploded” (ibid). He suggeststhat despite all efforts on the part of European governments to thecontrary, numbers of applications remain “at intolerably highlevels. At the same time, only the most resourceful – generally theyoung and male – can make it to Europe’s shores and they are byColonialism, Decolonisation, and the Right to be Human 425© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014definition not always the most deserving” (p.36). Haddad (2008)echoes this: “when numbers reached hitherto unimaginableheights, something had to change –one refugee is an individual inneed who should be let in, a thousand refugees are a threat and aburden” (p.31).This article problematises the suggestion that it is the unprec-edented nature of refugee flows since the 1980s which explainsthe character of the asylum regime in the manner of cause andeffect. In making this argument I will draw on an article by Chimni(1998), which charges academics with contributing to the pervasive“myth of difference” between European and “Third World” refugees.Chimni argues that the discourse of refugee studies up to 1989was relatively depoliticised due to a consensus that the concept ofasylum was consistent with Cold War aims. He writesThe arrival in the North, since the early eighties, of the “new asylum seekers”,initiated a process of rethinking. Once the Cold War ended, and the refugee nolonger possessed ideological or geopolitical value, the rethinking translated into aseries of restrictive measures which, together with those introduced earlier, consti-tute today what has been called the non-entrée regime (p.351)This policy shift was, according to Chimni, accompanied by therise and expansion of “refugee studies”. The new interdisciplinaryfield represented “the nature and character of refugee flows in theThird World . . . as being radically different from refugee flows inEurope at the end of the First World War” (ibid). Thus, “an imageof a ‘normal’ refugee was constructed – white, male and anti-communist – which clashed sharply with individuals fleeing theThird World” (ibid).On numbers, Skran (cited in Chimni 1998) points out that in1926 an estimated 9.5 million people were considered refugees,approximately the same as the refugee population in 1980.However, since the world’s population doubled in that time therewere proportionally more refugees in 1926. Europe now hosts atiny proportion of global refugees, whereas in the mid-twentiethcentury, as a producing region, it hosted a much greater propor-tion. The World Refugee Survey 1992 (cited in Chimni, 1998:59)shows that in 1991, a peak year in terms of applications for asylumin Europe, “Sudan alone was hosting more refugees than thenumber of applications received by Western Europe and NorthAmerica combined”.The issue appears less one of numbers then, and more theperception of an uncontrollable “flood” of visible refugees. As Blochand Schuster (2005) point out “although the numbers [of asylumseekers entering Europe] have never reached the levels of theearly 1990s, the measures introduced are not eased, but are added426 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014to – indicating that the “crisis’ itself has little to do with numbers.”(p.492). Indeed, applications for asylum in the UK fell by two thirdsbetween 2002 and 2008 (Information Centre on Asylum Seekersand Refugees 2009). A spike in applications in 1999 totalled91,200, while in the year and a half between the outbreak of theFirst World War and the end of 1915 the Home Office estimated that250,000 Belgian refugees alone arrived in the UK. 15,000 arrivedin Folkstone on one day (Storr 2009).Though the revolution intransport and telecommunications technology has allowed refugeesfrom outside of Europe to arrive more quickly, their numbersremain historically low, and are falling every year. Taking a longerview, Europe has been a significant producer of migrants globallysince 1800, peaking in the colonial period, and before that was byfar the major net producer of forced migrants through the slavetrade in to the nineteenth century (see Harzig and Hoerder 2009).A key aspect of this focus on “newness” is the fact that refugeesin the middle of the twentieth century are often presented asbeing European, only becoming non-European in the 1980s and’90s with the advent of cheap mass international air travel andgrowing instability in many African and Middle Eastern countries.In her discussion of the history of asylum legislation and refugeemovements, Schuster (2002), for example, focuses solely on Euro-pean refugees. Similarly, Barber and Ripley (1988) suggest thatin 1951 “the overwhelming majority of refugees were European”(p.53). Starting from this same assumption a decade later, Blochand Levy (1999) describes how the 1967 Protocol opened uprecourse to the 1951 Convention to people from all over the world“which reflected changes as refugees were no longer just a Euro-pean phenomenon; instead refugee migration was occurring fromconflicts all over the world” (p.1). And yet, there was a vastexodus from China between 1949 and 1950, millions of refugeescreated by the partition of India, millions as a consequence of theKorean War (1950–53), and 700,000 Palestinians became refugeesduring the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1948 (Sandler 1999, Morris2003, Chi-Kwan 2007). These issues were raised on a regularbasis in the British parliament throughout the 1950s (more thanEuropean refugee issues) and the country provided significantsums of bilateral aid (for example House of Commons, 19 March1951b). It might therefore be assumed that a discussion of thehistory of refugee policy, at least in Britain, would include somemention of such movements.In 1940 Britain and her Western European allies held Empirescovering much of the globe, founded and maintained on ideas ofracial hierarchy (Rich 1990). By 1960, a number had gained inde-pendence, while many of the remaining colonies were in turmoil asColonialism, Decolonisation, and the Right to be Human 427© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014anti-colonial movements struggled for self-determination. Whilethis reconfiguration of the global social and political order resultedin massive population displacements, ideas of racial hierarchy werenot necessarily dissolved. These events, integral to understandingconceptions of “insiders” and “outsiders”, and occurring concur-rently with the development of the asylum regime, are, I believe,highly pertinent to the history of refugee policy and to understand-ing the response of governments such as Britain to asylum seekerstoday.Silences around the colonial rationales that informed earlyexclusions from refugee rights, as well as around histories ofdisplacement outside of Europe, are therefore problematic in thelimitations they place on critical engagement with contemporaryasylum policy. For example, Boswell (2005) suggests that thestandards enshrined in the Geneva Convention “have been steadilyeroded since the 1970s” (p.3) as, “faced with large numbers ofasylum seekers they had little obvious economic or political in-centive to accept, industrialised states found their internationallegal obligations difficult to fulfill” (p.28). Factoring colonialism anddecolonisation into the analysis alters this account and provides ameans of problematising the “little obvious” incentive which hasbeen felt by politicians in Britain in recent decades. It shows thatexclusions are not recent deviations from earlier moral standards,they were there from the start. This may mean that there is lessthat is new in the present than many accounts suggest.Britain and the Convention NegotiationsThis section is concerned with the exclusion of particular peoplesfrom the remit of the refugee rights agenda in 1951. The Britishperspective provides a case study of a major colonial power and itsinvolvement in this systematic exclusion. Evidence is presentedwhich shows the extent of vocal resistance to exclusions on the partof a those whose refugees would not be considered under the rubricof the Convention. The British response is indicative of the fact thatrecent attempts to exclude non-European asylum seekers fromthe right to asylum are not new, they were an integral part of theBritish agenda at the outset of Convention negotiations. This facthas clear implications for our reading of current asylum policy, theperception of “newness”, and the “myth of difference”.a. Human Rights: the British Government ResponseIn the late 1940s British government ministers were against theinstitutionalization of human rights, particularly if they affected428 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014activities in the Empire. Discussions within the British state ofhuman rights in the late 1940s primarily took place within theForeign Office. The Foreign Office and Cabinet Office jointly led aninter-departmental working party, set up in 1946, of officials whichincluded the Home Office and Colonial Office (Cabinet Office Papers1947). The main concern of the Colonial Office lay in the dangerposed by the UN, and particularly its human rights agenda, forBritish colonial interests. For example, in a meeting of the workingparty on 9th June 1947 Mr.Grossmith (Colonial Office) stated that“The convention provided that forced labour be abolished in theshortest possible time, but at the present stage it would be impos-sible to develop certain of the colonial territories unless somedegree of forced labour were imposed” (see also Colonial Office1952). In addition, concern about the connection between theInternational Labour Organisation Convention on Forced Labourand human rights, and particularly the applicability of enforcedlabour provisions in the colonies, consumed a significant amountof time (ibid).British ministers were initially uninterested, then hostile to anyhuman rights conventions which might place demands on theBritish state, including those pertaining to refugees. For imperialinstitutionalists, the UN “was to be a device for cushioning theBritish Empire, cementing its ties with the United States, andcoming to terms with the unfortunate but tolerable fact that theSoviet Union had become a world power” (Mazower, 2009:104).When proposals came along which placed demands inconsistentwith the activities of Empire, therefore, they were not well received(Colonial Office 1952).The cabinet secretary’s notebooks from the period show thatthere were long discussions between senior British ministers aboutnot wanting to be bound by the human rights conventions, butequally not wanting to be seen to be against them. This is pertinentto the outcome of the refugee convention as the broader humanrights agenda set the stage, and in many cases the written prec-edent, upon which the outcomes of the negotiations on refugeeagreements were based. There are commonalities here with thepresent: reiteration of commitments to “genuine” refugees, whilerestrictive asylum policies suggesting the opposite are imple-mented. There was a belief that the British had an innate under-standing of rights, liberties and justice, and that this was sointrinsic to the national character that it was not necessary tocodify it in law. If there were exceptions to the rule (in the colonies,for example), they were always for the good of people who were notyet able to look after themselves. For example, in the UK submis-sion to the UN yearbook on human rights in 1946, where eachColonialism, Decolonisation, and the Right to be Human 429© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014member country reported on their perspective on human rights andthe situation in their country (which was the first indication of theBritish position on the subject) Sir Cecil Carr concludedAlthough human rights in Britain do not rest upon a written constitution, this briefsurvey will have shown that what Lord Wright described as “the good sense of thepeople” and “the representative and responsible government which has been evolvedhere” have produced a society in which the fundamental human liberties arerespected and protected to the full (p.321)Here, Carr is speaking primarily of white British citizens locatedin the metropolitan territory. The dominant hierarchical viewof humanity (see Rich 1990, Banton 1998) set the non-whitecolonised below their imperial rulers and hence at the mercy oftheir perception of “good sense” in the case of caring for “child like”races (a term often used by Jan Smuts, see Smuts 1944).There was a concern that a legally binding human rights con-vention would put in place a body of law above the sovereign Britishlegislature, and over the judicial review functions of the House ofLords. This provided a legally inflected nationalistic justificationfor objecting to inconvenient international legal constraints. Thesesuspicions, however, did not develop into solid opposition for acouple of years, primarily because many senior British ministersdid not take human rights particularly seriously.There was pressure on the government from within (primarily theForeign Office) to support a European Convention on Human Rightswithin the context of Cold War politics (Bevin 24th October 1949:3).Thus, despite reservations, they determined to be in favour of aEuropean Bill of Human Rights. However, for the time being thegovernment remained privately against a UN convention, as therewere no decipherable benefits and many dangers. One of the centraldangers lay in the colonial question: the British government werereluctant to sign the conventions if they applied to people in thecolonies. As early as 1947 the problems raised by colonial activitieswithin the context of a proposed International Bill of Human Rightswas causing concern. The cabinet secretary’s notebook entry for 30thOctober (Brook 1947) that year contains the following notes:R.W.1 In formula, don’t use phrase “Col. Territories”.There are 8 areas where comp. Labour in force.Words “exceptional condns. . .” will cover our case.This shows that right from the start, ministers were aware thattheir treatment of colonised subjects would not meet the standardsdemanded by a concept of rights based on humanity. In their430 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014Empire, all humans were not equal and change was not (at thispoint) an option.In the late 1940s government ministers do not appear too con-cerned about the Bill, assuming that an “exceptional conditions”clause could be inserted without too many problems. Such a clausewould exclude certain groups from rights claims with the justifica-tion that “exceptional conditions” necessitated such action. Thosegroups to be excluded were, of course, colonial subjects: In a memoto the Cabinet from the Foreign Office in 1949 it was recommendedthat the Foreign Secretary should accept in principle that a Con-vention should be drawn up but that he “should, if possible, refrainat the present stage from taking up a position on the applicationof the convention to colonial territories”. The Foreign Secretaryduly refrained in public but by January 1951 the issue was lookingmore problematic, as this conversation from the Cabinet Secre-tary’s notebooks shows:J.G. Want it clear tht. Protocols may be accepted separately in Col. Territories.Cd. Not apply 7 at once in Colonies.J. Second Protocol “. . . so far as resources permit.” Who is to judge? CanCommn rule our resources allow of our doing more for education in aColony?H.M.2 I have always bn. against this Convention – all of it. Humbug.A3 Prefer a frontal attack of this nonsense. Don’t express any sympathy.Att.G. Not merely Layton. Some Tories & Labour supporters keenly favour it.P.M. 3rd Protocol: restrict to home territories4In April 1951 the Cabinet discussion continues with increasinganxiety:H,M. I don’t know anything about this – except that we are in a mess. Started asanti-Soviet propaganda. As it goes on, it looks as tho’ it will put us on thespot – especially re. Colonies.J.G. Col.

Stay in and make difficulties.V. difficult for us to walk out.G.W.5 As it stands, w’out Col. appln clause, it is unacceptable to us.We should realise that.6 (Brook, 1951)Here, we can see the tension between the need to maintain anoutward image commensurate with world power status (high moralColonialism, Decolonisation, and the Right to be Human 431© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014standards), and the reality of activities in the Empire; with a beliefthat such activities should continue despite ongoing negotiationson human rights. The “colonial application clause referred to is,again, the proposal to exclude colonised people’s from access tohuman rights (in simple terms, colonial non-application). In Marchthe following year, the discussion appears as follows:S.Ll.7 [Human rights] Designed to embarrass Russians, has ended up by embar-rassing us and U.S. much more because of coloured populns.One Covenant signed.This one will surely emerge in a form wh. we can’t ratify.We must go on with the knowledge that we will never ratify.O.L.8 Can’t ratify anything wh. involves enforcement.M-F.9 We cdn’t reverse engines on enforcemt.O.L. V.well. Let’s pursue policy of steady obstruction by legal quibbles. (Brook,1952)Human rights was becoming embarrassing because “colouredpopulations” were treated as inferior humans by Britain and theUS, despite the British Empire’s rhetoric of fairness and equality.Over time, due to domestic and external pressure, not least theneed to be seen to take the moral high ground internationally, therewas little choice but to sign up to the human rights agenda as itunfolded. The central concern was ensuring the least inhibitingoutcome regarding activities in the Empire.At the same time as remaining reluctant to sign a broad humanrights Convention which might be applicable to the colonies, theBritish government were similarly reluctant to include colonisedpeoples under the rubric of the proposed Refugee Convention.That is not to suggest that aid for non-European refugees waswithheld. On the contrary, with widespread support in parliament,the government provided significant sums of bilateral aid to assistnon-European refugees, for example Koreans in the early 1950s.The signal was that help should be extended in exceptional cir-cumstances but a line must be drawn at access to fundamentalrights. Indeed, Arab (Palestinian) and Korean refuges were dis-cussed more in parliament in 1951 than European refugees(House of Commons 15 March 1951a, 19 March 1951b). Despitethe volume of discussion, never did the issue of extending the UNConvention right to asylum in the case of these refugees appear.In the negotiations on human rights at the UN the standard(at the time) British approach to international treaty draftingwas pursued -pushing for a colonial application clause. As previ-ously stated, such clauses were inserted into treaties so that the432 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014British were under no obligation to apply them in the colonies. Thegovernment publicly argued that non-application was a meansof promoting self-determination and democracy in the colonies,despite appearing to have the opposite effect (Simpson 2004).Records of the UN Ad Hoc Committee on Refugees and StatelessPersons and the UN Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Statusof Refugees and Stateless Persons show these bodies deferringback to discussions on colonial application covered in the humanrights convention discussions. In these discussions the delegatefor the UKemphasized that the question before the Committee was not whether it was right orwrong that a colonial system should still exist in the 20th Century but merelywhether, with such system in existence a colonial clause should be incorporated inthe Covenant [. . . colonised] peoples were constantly progressing along the roadto self-government and independence and it was precisely in order to take suchprogress into account that a colonial clause should be inserted in the Covenant . . .(United Nations 17 February 1950)Those in agreement with the UK delegate were France, Belgium,Greece, Australia, New Zealand and Canada – the major colonialpowers, and large white settler colonies. Those against, whoseobjections are elaborated in the next section, were numerous andincluded India, Syria, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Indo-nesia, Lebanon, Mexico, Chile and Afghanistan – the colonised andformerly colonised peoples of the world.The objectors, using persuasive language and statistical evi-dence, were successful in arguing against the colonial applicationclause. Nevertheless, defeating this clause was rendered pointlesswhen an alternative, less emotive in title – yet identical in principle-“territorial application clause”, was proposed and passed later inthe negotiations. Thus, Article 40, paragraph 1 of the final RefugeeConvention document, the territorial application clause, stated:Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, declare that thisConvention shall extend to all or any of the territories for the international relationsof which it is responsible. Such a declaration shall take effect when the Conventionenters into force for the State concerned.Despite at this time holding significant overseas territories, the UKextended the Convention only to the Channel Islands and the Isleof Man.b. The Anti-Colonial ChallengeThe evidence presented above reveals the degree to which theBritish, alongside other colonial powers, sought to resist theColonialism, Decolonisation, and the Right to be Human 433© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014extension of rights to the colonised in 1951. This section is con-cerned with resistance to this agenda at the UN negotiating table.Highlighting this resistance is important because it highlights thefallacy of the myth of difference; particularly the perception thatrefugees at the time of signing the convention were primarily aEuropean phenomenon. This is the other side of the story, and onewhich sets a critical analysis of the present within a much broaderhistory.Discussions regarding the territorial applicability of the refugeeconvention were very much framed within discussions of the “colo-nial application clause” within the human rights convention. Aspreviously stated, the old colonial powers, Britain included, were infavour of such a clause. In response, many of the objections to theclause came from delegations with experience, currently or in therecent past, of living under colonial rule, and were articulated interms of anti-colonialism. For example, Indonesian representative(unnamed in the record transcript but likely to be Mr. Nikijoeloew)pointed out that if the clause were included the General Assembly would in effect begiving a privileged class of human beings the right to decide arbitrarily how far therights enjoyed unreservedly by themselves could be granted to less favoured classes.The Saudi Arabian representative, (unnamed in the record tran-script but likely to be Mr Baroody)explained the effects of the colonial situation upon the problem under discussion, solong as the colonies remained indispensable to the economic survival of the metro-politan powers, those powers could not afford to allow the dependent peoples toenjoy the advantages of instruments like the Covenant which would make themconscious of their rights.The representative of Afghanistan stated that “those who claimedthey were trying to civilize the peoples whom they were colonizingshould at least give them the right to learn how to become con-scious of their human dignity”.Meanwhile, the delegation from India wasstrongly opposed to the insertion of the colonial clause because it was precisely inthe Non-Self-Governing Territories and in the colonies that the Covenant should beespecially applied, since it was there that violations of human rights were unfortu-nately most frequent (United Nations 3 July 1951)The records of the discussions at the UN on a convention forrefugees and displaced persons in the late 1940s show clear andconsistent resistance from some states (all former colonies) regard-ing an exclusive refugee definition. It appeared as though the IRO434 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014definition would be used. In November 1949, Pakistani represen-tative Mr. Bokhari, called for a revision of the refugee definition. Hepointed out thatAs defined in the Constitution of the IRO, that term only applied to victims ofevents which had occurred during the Second World War in Europe. After the endof hostilities, however, other events had taken place in other parts of the world. If theUnited Nations was to be entrusted with that problem, it should consider it on aworld-wide basis. [. . .] Pakistan had been compelled to receive from 6 to 7 millionrefugees coming from various parts of India. More recently it had had to give asylumto 500,000 or 600,000 fugitives from Kashmir (UN General Assembly 10 November1949a)In the following meeting, the representative of India noted thatalthough India was not a member of the IRO, “it had done itsutmost to aid both UNRRA and the IRO and had helped six thou-sand European refugees to settle in its territory after the war” whilealso coping with its own refugee problem, namely six million Indianrefugees displaced through partition, who had to be looked afterand resettled. He “hoped the United Nations would acknowledgethat India was performing an international as well as a nationalduty by helping those people, and that it would not be asked toshoulder any further responsibility regarding European refugees”.This was followed by support for the Pakistani representative’ssuggestion that the IRO be maintained and that it address itselfto the drafting of a convention on the legal protection of refugeeseverywhere (UN General Assembly 10 November 1949a). Theseobjections explicitly highlighted the presence of a hierarchical con-ception of humanity at work in the negotiations, associated thiswith colonialism, and challenged it right from the start.Mrs. Roosevelt (USA), leader of the Human Rights Commission,replied that “the matter required very careful consideration” andshe wondered “whether the General Assembly would be prepared atthe present juncture to assume responsibility for other groups ofrefugees than those defined in the IRO Constitution”. Ultimately,she dismissed the query as the Economic and Social Council hadset up an ad hoc Committee to review existing conventions provid-ing protection for refugees and she assumed therefore that thismatter would be discussed there. The Pakistani representativewelcomed the formation of this committee but reiterated the factthat “if the proposal before the Committee were adopted, Pakistanwould have to share in financing the legal protection of an unde-fined number of refugees in Europe, while obtaining no benefits forthe millions of refugees in its own country”. Indeed “there was nomention in any formal proposal of extending the protection of thenew organization to all categories of refugees and he hoped thatColonialism, Decolonisation, and the Right to be Human 435© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014some concrete amendments would be submitted in order to allayhis anxiety”. The Lebanese representative concurred that the draftresolution left out new categories of refugees who did not comeunder the protection of the IRO, specifying Greece, Pakistan, Indiaand China as examples. He said “it should be possible for theUnited Nations to extend his services to cover all refugees” (UNGeneral Assembly 11 November 1949b).At the next meeting the Pakistani representative again raised theissue of the refugee definition, stating thathe had gathered the unfortunate impression that some delegations entertainedserious doubts as to the purely humanitarian aspect of the problem of refugees andalso that politics had perhaps made an unwelcome intrusion into the question . . .he deplored a situation in which refugees might find themselves mere pawns on theinternational chessboard (UN General Assembly 16 November 1949c)The implication that “other categories might be added at some laterstage” begged the question “what other categories, or when andhow they might so be added [it has] never been made clear.” Iraqirepresentative Mrs. Afnan expressed “full support for the viewsoutlined by the representative of Pakistan”, as did the Lebaneserepresentative. French representative Mr. Rochefort in response,“regretted that [such] a confusion between refugees and statelesspersons continued”. This did not placate the objectors and theIraqi, Indian, Brazilian and Ethiopian representatives all expressedsimilar concerns (ibid). Resistance was therefore vocal, repeated,and articulated in explicitly anti-colonial terms. For these coun-tries, none European or European white settler states, it was clearthat exclusivity in the human rights framework reflected long heldbeliefs in a hierarchy of humanity. Their ultimate silencing wasnot for want of persistently setting out their cases, as equals, forinclusion in the Convention.It is important to note here that states such as Pakistan andIndia were represented at the UN, and therefore able to voice theirconcerns because they had gained independence. Other voicescould not be heard in any capacity, though rarely for want of trying.For example, in 1945 the African members of Nigeria’s Legisla-tive Council passed a resolution unanimously asking the Britishgovernment to approve a delegation of two unofficial (i.e. African)members to attend the San Francisco conference on human rights(Sherwood, 1996). The British Colonial Office replied that “no suchobservers were to be allowed” and none were present at the sub-sequent negotiations (ibid: cited p.81).This section has demonstrated that in response to British(and other colonial power) objections to extending human rights,including the right to asylum, to the colonies, there were very vocal436 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014counter-arguments being made at the negotiations of the late1940s and early 1950s. As the earlier part of the case studyshowed, exclusions were to be made on the basis of not only beinga colonised subject, but also being non-European, which was seenas sufficient justification for exclusion from the rights associatedwith the new Refugee Convention. The silences surrounding thesenegotiations and the consequent denials of rights claims were thereat the very inception of human rights.There are significant implications of highlighting these histories,which are rarely paid sufficient attention in addressing contem-porary efforts to limit access to the right to asylum. Not least inforegrounding the longevity of exclusionary asylum practices on thepart of Western European states such as Britain. Indeed, if exclu-sions are not new then the critical basis of academic scholarshipon asylum needs to be revisited, and Chimni’s “myth of difference”charge taken seriously. What the implications of this analysismight be for our understanding of the present are addressedfurther below.ConclusionChimni (1998) argues that there is a pervasive “myth of difference”in scholarship on refugees and asylum seekers which representspresent day asylum seekers, often fleeing countries outside Europe,as fundamentally different from previous cohorts. In seeking acritical alternative to this reading, this article has investigated thefounding moment of modern refugee rights. With specific referenceto the British case and citing new archival evidence, a number ofkey points have been made. First, that the British governmentwas hostile to granting non-European asylum seekers refugeerights under international law from the start of the refugee regime.Second, that there were millions of non-European refugees in needof help at the time of drafting the Geneva Convention, who shouldbe acknowledged as part of the history of refugee policy. Third, thatthere were many states arguing forcefully at the UN, that these“other” refugees should be included under a new refugee Conven-tion. Their exclusion was intentional.Scholarship on refugee rights as a universalising approach haslargely developed without an account of the histories of dominationon which such a regime was founded. Malkki (1995) providesjustification for this narrow geographical focus, arguing that inthe genealogy of “the refugee”, a moment of reconfiguration canbe located in post-World War Two Europe. She acknowledges thedanger of Eurocentrism “in looking for the global figure of therefugee in post-war Europe” but argues that “it is in the EuropeColonialism, Decolonisation, and the Right to be Human 437© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014emerging from World War II, that certain key techniques for man-aging mass displacements of people first became standardized andthen globalized” (p.497). Whilethis does not mean there were no refugees or techniques for managing them beforeWorld War II . . . “the refugee” as a specific social category . . . and legal problem ofglobal dimensions did not exist in its full modern form before this period. (p.497–8)Yet, as we have seen, “the refugee” of the period was not alwaysEuropean. Indeed, while the process of which Malkki speaks (bywhich refugees came to be designated “a specific social category”and a “legal problem of global dimensions”) is one of perceptionin the minds of the political leadership of Europe, with the figureof the European refugee in mind. Once we acknowledge the fact ofnon-European refugees in the period, the spectre of colonialismbecomes unavoidable. For example, the presence of millions ofIndian refugees in Pakistan, described in the case study section,cannot be accounted for without reference to decolonisation.Both the experience of Empire and decolonisation had a profoundimpact on life in Britain, from facilitating the industrial revolutionin the nineteenth century to facilitating the arrival of new migrants(see Rex and Tomlinson 1979, Fryer 1984, Joshi and Carter 1984,Visram 2002, Bhambra 2007). While the reconfiguration of theglobal social and political order which accompanied decolonisationresulted in massive population displacements, ideas of racial hier-archy were not necessarily dissolved. As Rex and Tomlinson (1979)pointed out in their Colonial Immigrants in a British City, the end ofEmpire did not herald a new dawn of equality but “hostile beliefsand attitudes . . . came to be sanctioned by the highest moralauthority” (p.288), leading to a “vicious cumulative spiral of esca-lating racism” (p.291).These events, then, integral to understanding conceptionsof “insiders” and “outsiders”, and occurring concurrently with thedevelopment of the asylum regime, are highly pertinent to thehistory of refugee and asylum policy and to understandingthe response of governments like the British to asylum seekerstoday. While the policy regime may appear to be new, this does notnecessarily mean that the situation being presented to policymakers is new. We must not assume logical pathways to policymaking in the manner of cause and effect. Nor must we assumethat policy choices are inevitable or “natural” reactions. Further-more, while the politics of asylum may appear to have taken on anovel character in recent decades, its purportedly universal prin-ciples should not be allowed to hide the inter-relations betweenthis policy area and longer histories of colonialism, exclusion, and438 Lucy Mayblin© 2014 The Author. Journal of Historical Sociology published by John Wiley & Sons, LtdJournal of Historical Sociology Vol. 27 No. 3 September 2014“othering” which are deeply embedded in the hegemonic epistemol-ogy of colonial modernity. This is not simply a matter of historicalnuance; rethinking these histories is not irrelevant to the pressingissues facing asylum seekers and refugees today. It is fundamentalto critical engagement with contemporary asylum policy.Notes1 David Rees Rees-Williams, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies2 Herbert Morrison, who succeeded Ernest Bevin as Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs two months later.3 Viscount Addison, leader of the House of Lords and Lord Privy Seal4 This is an edited extract.5 Patrick Gordon-Walker, Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelations.6 This is an edited extract.7 John Selwyn-Lloyd, Foreign Secretary.8 Oliver Lyttleton, Secretary of State for the Colonies.9 David Maxwell-Fyfe, Home Secretary.ReferencesBacon, C.
