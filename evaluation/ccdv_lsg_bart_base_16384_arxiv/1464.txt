ABSTRACT: 
As urban agriculture grows in popularity, researchers are attempting to quantify its potential contribution to local food systems. We present the results of a vacant land inventory conducted in collaboration with the HOPE Collaborative, a multi-stakeholder, community-based initiative in Oakland, CA, USA. Vacant lots, open space, and underutilized parks with agricultural potential were identified using GIS and aerial imagery. Using visual interpretation, we identified 1201 ac (486.4 ha) of public land and 337 ac (136.4 ha) of private land that could potentially be used for vegetable production. Based on USDA loss-adjusted consumption data, we calculated the potential contribution of these sites to the city\u27s current and recommended vegetable needs. Calculations were based on average yields under three different management practices: conventional at 10 tons/ac (22.4 Mg/ha); low-biointensive at 15 tons/ac (33.6 Mg/ha); and medium-biointensive at 25 tons/ac (56.0 Mg/ha). Four different land use scenarios were considered: (1) all identified sites .

Introduction "!Across North America vacant land is taking center stage in the efforts of activists, #!community members, non-profit organizations, and local governments to increase food $!production in the city. Dozens of urban agriculture initiatives have taken root on large vacant %!parcels and in city parks, ranging in scale and scope from small community gardens to urban &!farms of several acres run by non-profits or commercial market gardeners. Most are launched in '!collaboration through use or lease agreements with public agencies, private landowners, or land (!trusts (Hodgson, Caton Campbell, & Bailkey, 2011; Nordahl, 2009). While its impact on urban )!diets and income creation should not be overstated, urban agriculture has become an attractive *!land use because of its potential to addresses multiple needs, supplying fresh produce in "+!neighborhoods with limited access to healthy food while offering opportunities for employment, ""!education, and recreation (Hodgson et al., 2011; Hou, Johnson, & Lawson, 2009; Redwood, "#!2011). "$!As planners, public health officials, and community groups alike articulate the linkages "%!between food systems, health, and the built environment (Corburn, 2009; Muller, Tagtow, "&!Roberts, & MacDougall, 2009; Pothukuchi, 2009), locating possible sites for urban agriculture "'!has become a priority. Over the past few years, researchers have conducted inventories of vacant "(!land with agricultural potential in Portland (Balmer et al., 2005), Vancouver (Kaethler, 2006), ")!Seattle (Horst, 2008), Cleveland (Grewal & Grewal, 2012; Taggart, Chaney, & Meaney, 2009), "*!Detroit (Colasanti & Hamm, 2010), Toronto (MacRae et al., 2010), Chicago (Taylor & Lovell, #+!2012), and New York (Ackerman, 2012). Only some of these inventories, however, estimate the #"!potential productivity of the identified land or its ability to meet consumer demands for fresh ##!fruits and vegetables. #$!*Manuscript (with references and tables)Click here to view linked References 2!To address health disparities in Oakland, California, food justice organizations interested #%!in ramping up urban agriculture have eyed the FLW\Â¶Vnumerous vacant lots.

The flatlands are low-lying areas largely comprised of fill (e.g., dredged %%!sediment, construction debris, quarried rocks), adjacent to the San FrancisFR%D\WRWKHFLW\Â¶V%&!west and Alameda Estuary and San Leandro Bay to the south (see Figure 1). The foothills are %'! 3!formed on a gentle fan of alluvium spreading downwards from the Oakland hills, a series of %(!undulating, parallel ridges thrust upwards along the Hayward and Moraga faults and which run %)!DORQJWKHFLW\Â¶VHDVWHUQSRUWLRQDORQJDQRUWKZHVW-southeast axis (Sloan, 2006). Soils in the %*!flatlands are a mix of urban land (highly mixed, heterogeneous fill) and complexes of urban land &+!and endogenous soils derived from sedimentary, alluvial parent material, while the complexes in &"!the hills are dominated by a number of excessively drained loams weathered from uplifted &#!conglomerate and ultrabasic metamorphic rock (Welch, 1981). The climate is Mediterranean &$!with wet winters and dry summers with morning fog. Average annual precipitation is 22.9 in &%!(582.7 mm), with 89% of the total rainfall occurring between November and April. September is &&!the hottest month with an average high temperature of 80.6ÂºF (27ÂºC); January is the coldest &'!month, with an average high of 58.1ÂºF (14.5ÂºC) (NOAA, 2004). Native vegetation includes oak &(!(Quercus sp.) woodland, coastal shrub, and coastal terrace prairie, with large redwood (Sequoia &)!sempervirens) stands in the drainages (Beidleman & Kozloff, 2003). &*![FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE] '+! '"!2.2. Social landscape '#!Oakland (pop. 391,000) is one of three core cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, a major '$!American metropolitan region populated by 7.2 million people and comprised of nine counties '%!and 101 municipalities (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). 2DNODQGÂ¶V downtown central business '&!district is located immediately west of Lake Merritt, the physical landmark demarcating East ''!Oakland from the rest of the city. Two freeways roughly delimit the flatlands from the hills: CA-'(!24 along the north-south axis west of downtown, and I-580 along the northwest-southeast axis ')!south of the Oakland hills and foothills (see Figure 1). '*! 4!From its founding in the early 1850s, the city grew eastwards from West Oakland and (+!downtown. The terminus of the trans-FRQWLQHQWDOUDLOURDGLQ:HVW2DNODQGOHGWRWKHFLW\Â¶Vrapid ("!growth beginning in the late 19th-century, followed by major shipbuilding, automobile (#!manufacture, and food processing during the First World War. For most of the 20th century, ($!industry, commercial transportation, and warehousing were concentrated in the flatlands around (%!the Port of Oakland in West Oakland and along the Alameda Estuary. The remainder of the (&!flatlands and hills developed as residential neighborhoods (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010; Walker, ('!2001). ((!Census data reveal a disproportionate concentration of poverty in the flatlands of North, ()!West, and East Oakland, affecting a population that is majority African American, Southeast (*!Asian, and Latino.

The spatial inequities of the socioeconomic )"!landscape are largely due to the historical demarcation of areas where particular ethnic groups )#!were allowed to live as well as where investment capital flowed.

In Oakland, 20% of families live below the *+!federal poverty line. Approximately one-third of Alameda &RXQW\Â¶VUHVLGHQWVDUHIRRGLQVHFXUH*"!and 87% of Oakland school children receive free or reduced-price lunch (ACPHD, 2008; OFPC, *#! 5!2010).

Over the last decade, several food justice organizations have attempted to *&!address inequitable access to healthy food through a variety of programs and policy *'!recommendations. Urban agriculture has been central to these efforts and has begun to figure *(!prominently in food systems, public health, and land use planning discussions in Oakland *)!(McClintock, Wooten, & Brown, 2012). **! "++!2.3.

Developed iteratively with "+&!community stakeholders, the project took shape within the following context. In 2006 the "+'!Oakland City Council embraced a goal of sourcing 30% of its food locally, and passed "+(!Resolution No. 79680 to support a food system assessment for the city. The resulting Oakland "+)!Food System Assessment (OFSA) evaluated the existing avenues of food distribution and "+*!consumption in Oakland, including food production within a 200 mi (321.9 km) radius from the ""+!city (Unger & Wooten, 2006). While the vast majority of food consumed in Oakland comes """!from outside of this area, local food systems advocates have underscored the importance of food ""#!production within the city itself in order to promote education, reduce the distance between ""$!production and consumption, enhance green space, and create green job opportunities (Hodgson ""%!et al., 2011; OFPC, 2010). While urban agriculture in Oakland is widespread, the contribution of ""&! 6!existing JDUGHQVWRWKHFLW\Â¶VWRWDOFRQVXPSWLRQRI vegetables is unknown and difficult to ""'!quantify. There are currently more than 100 school gardens in Oakland, 10 community gardens ""(!managed by the Office of Parks and Recreation (OPR), and dozens managed by non-profit "")!organizations (Farfan-Ramirez, Olivera, Pascoe, & Safinya-Davies, 2010; OFPC, 2010; Unger ""*!& Wooten, 2006). No data on residential gardening exists for Oakland, but national data reveal "#+!that almost 40% of Americans grow vegetables in their yards (Marks, 2008).

Key sub-questions included: Where is there available land? Who owns it? How much is "%+!there? How much produce could be grown on it? "%"!In early 2009, HOPE members collectively prioritized the need to move forward with "%#!such an assessment as a crucial first step toward the development of a robust food system for "%$!low-income flatlands neighborhoods and funded a research assistant (J. Cooper) to help complete "%%!the inventory. McClintock and Cooper completed the majority of GIS analysis and mapping "%&!between January and June 2009 and released a final report (McClintock & Cooper, 2009) in "%'!October 2009, with hopes that the inventory might help non-profit organizations and city "%(!officials identify potential urban agriculture sites and inform food policy decisions. "%)!Over the course of the project we worked collaboratively with HOPE members, city "%*!officials, and urban agriculture organizations, establishing a community advisory committee "&+!made up of members from these groups to brainstorm criteria for selection of potential sites and "&"!provide feedback on what information would be useful in the finished report. Advisory "&#!committee members also provided feedback on several drafts of the report before its release. The "&$!process of defining the parameters of the research was iterative, a defining characteristic of "&%!collaborative or participatory research (Israel et al., 2005; Minkler & Wallerstein, 2003). "&&!Moreover, the project itself was iterative, and continued even DIWHUWKHUHSRUWÂ¶VUHOHDVH. Extensive "&'!ground-truthing of sites was conducted throughout 2010. In Fall 2010, McClintock conducted a "&(!finer-grained slope analysis and a research assistant (S. Khandeshi) analyzed a data layer of "&)!privately owned vacant land. Building on methods used in assessments of vacant land in Detroit "&*!(Colasanti & Hamm, 2010) and Toronto (MacRae et al., 2010), McClintock then calculated the "'+!potential contribution of inventoried vacant land WR2DNODQGÂ¶VHVWLPDWHGcurrent and "'"! 8!recommended vegetable consumption.

Vacant land inventory "'(!Following the lead of early vacant land inventories conducted in Portland (Balmer et al., "')!2005), Vancouver (Kaethler, 2006), and Seattle (Horst, 2008), our goal was to locate vacant "'*!parcels that could potentially serve as sites of food production. Upon initial examination, we "(+!realized that the amount of actual vacant public land (e.g., land with no existing use, such as a "("!park or lawn or playing field) in Oakland was limited. We therefore chose to broaden the scope "(#!of our investigation to include any underutilized public land that could potentially be used for "($!crop production, with the understanding that actual site selection would ultimately depend on "(%!additional criteria and community input. "(&![FIGURES 2a and 2b ABOUT HERE] "('!We used ArcGIS 9.3 software to identify, delineate, and catalog areas where crops could "((!potentially be grown, as well as to calculate area, slope, and aspect of the sites.

Zoning and General Plan land use classifications were joined to each site. ")$![TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] ")%! 9!We then exported and overlaid the parcel layer onto National Agriculture Imagery ")&!Program (NAIP) 1-m satellite imagery (USDA, 2005). Systematically following a 1-km grid ")'!overlay, we used visual interpretation to select parcels containing potentially arable land, ")(!including parcels that appeared vacant or that contained lawns, fields, and other open spaces "))!within a park or adjacent to a government facility (see Figures 2a and 2b). We excluded fully ")*!developed parcels and spaces with an apparent use, such as playing fields and parking lots, but in "*+!a few cases included parking lots that appeared to have been abandoned, as such sites could be "*"!used for food production in greenhouses or raised beds. "*#!We clipped out buildings and developed areas such as roads, playing fields, and parking "*$!lots and classified each parcel into one of four ground cover categories: soil/grass (less than 25% "*%!coverage by dense vegetation or hard surface); hard surface (>25% asphalt, concrete, or gravel, "*&!and <500 ft2 of contiguous open soil/grass); mixed surface (> 25% asphalt, concrete, or gravel, "*'!but >500 ft2 of contiguous open soil/grass), or dense vegetation (>25% dense vegetation and "*(!<500 ft2 of contiguous open soil/grass). Dense vegetation parcels containing <500 ft2 of "*)!contiguous open soil/grass were removed, while those containing >500 ft2 were modified by "**!clipping out the vegetation. Finally, any parcel with <500 ft2 (46.5 m2) of open space was #++!removed from the final inventory. #+"!The aggregated area that remained (which included soil/grass, hard surface, and mixed #+#!surface) formed the total area classified as arable. To calculate slope at each site, we transformed #+$!parcel polygons to a raster and calculated average slope for each 100 m2 raster square using a #+%!digital elevation model (DEM). The raster was then reclassified into: slopes <10%; between 10 #+&!and 30%; and >30%, a practical threshold slope for cultivation (while agriculture is practiced on #+'!slopes greater than 30% in many parts of the world, terracing or other stabilization techniques are #+(! 10!generally required). Using the slope raster and DEM, we also created an aspect raster, which we #+)!then reclassified DVÂ³RSWLPDOÂ´VORSHDQG:6:66(RU(DVSHFWRUÂ³OHVVGHVLUDEOHÂ´#+*!(>30% slope and NW, N, or NE aspect). Finally, we spatially joined water meters, schools, and #"+!bus stops to the inventory layer, and queried all sites within 10 ft (3.05 m) of a water meter, 0.25 #""!mi (0.40 km) of a school, and/or 0.25 mi (0.40 km) of a bus stop, attributes that were presented #"#!in the final database and report. #"$!To account for limitations posed by visual interpretation of the NAIP imagery, we cross-#"%!checked all sites with more recent Google Maps imagery and visited a geographically #"&!representative sample of sites to assess vegetation density and slope. We visited 50 of 495 total #"'!sites (10%) in 2009, and an additional 120 sites (24%) in 2010 under the purview of a related soil #"(!sampling project (McClintock, 2012). Overall, seven densely vegetated sites (4% of total #")!ground-truthed sites) were removed from the inventory. #"*!Using vacant parcels data obtained from the UC Berkeley Department of City and ##+!Regional Planning in Fall 2010, we followed roughly the same GIS protocol to calculate the ##"!amount of potentially arable privately owned vacant land. This time we used ArcGIS 10 and a ###!current Bing Maps base layer (rather than NAIP imagery) to visually interpret the 4,249 vacant ##$!parcels. Given the extensive labor required, we modified the selection criteria, whereby parcels ##%!containing >25% dense vegetation were removed from the inventory. Similarly, parcels ##&!containing >25% infrastructure (such as outbuildings or pavement) or with a clear existing use ##'!(such as parking or junk storage) were removed. Due to the variation in selection criteria ##(!between public and private parcels, we have chosen to report the results separately. ##)! ##*!3.2. Calculating consumption #$+! 11!7RFDOFXODWHWKHYHJHWDEOHQHHGVRI2DNODQGÂ¶VSRSXODWLRQwe used population data (sex #$"!and age cohorts) from the 2010 US Census, then aggregated cohorts into larger groups based on #$#!USDA recommendations for vegetable intake. Recommended consumption for all cohorts was #$$!then aggregated into an overall citywide demand (see Table 2). Both the Detroit (Colasanti & #$%!Hamm, 2010) and Toronto (MacRae et al., 2010) studies, however, assessed the potential for #$&!vacant land to contribute to actual consumption rather than recommended consumption. #$'!Following the Detroit study, we obtained consumption data from the USDA ERS Loss-Adjusted #$(!Food Availability Database (USDA, 2010) which calculates average national per capita fresh #$)!vegetable consumption from aggregate production, adjusting for losses between production and #$*!consumption. Using the national per capita consumption for each fresh vegetable crop (see #%+!Appendix A), we extrapolated current and recommended Oakland consumption based on the #%"!population data presented in Table 2. #%#![TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] #%$!When calculating potential productivity of vacant land, it is important to factor in both #%%!the geographic adaptability of a particular crop to the local agroecosystem and its seasonality. #%&!Following the Detroit study, we calculated the potential local/seasonal share of current and #%'!recommended consumption, divided the number of months that a particular crop can be #%(!harvested in Oakland by 12 months, then multiplied the coefficient by estimated current and #%)!recommended consumption levels for each crop (see Appendix A). Three of the USDA database #%*!cropsÂ²lima beans, okra, sweet corn, and sweet potatoesÂ²do not grow well in Oakland, #&+!requiring warmer and sunnier conditions (sweet corn, for example, rarely produces large ears #&"!during the Bay Area foggy summers). They were therefore excluded from the local/seasonal #&#!productivity calculations. #&$! 12! #&%!3.3. Calculating productivity #&&!No yield data was available from actual urban gardens in Oakland. The Detroit study #&'!used three different production scenarios to estimate the amount necessary to meet consumer #&(!demands: high-productivity biointensive, low-productivity biointensive, and commercial. #&)!Following this logic, we averaged California statewide yield data from 1998 to 2008 for each of #&*!the vegetable crops listed in the USDA database as well as low and medium yields using #'+!biointensive methods calculated in Northern California (Jeavons, 2002). Vegetable yields under #'"!conventional management average 13.2 tons per acre (29.6 Mg/ha). Low biointensive yields, #'#!which assume a beginning gardener, are slightly higher at 15.4 tons per acre (34.5 Mg/ha) while #'$!medium biointensive yield averages are twice as high (30.8 tons per acre or 69.0 Mg/ha) (see #'%!Appendix 2). Unlike the Detroit researchers, we used medium biointensive yields for each crop #'&!rather than high yields (which many gardeners argue are unrealistic). Finally, we interviewed #''!three organic farmers operating intensive commercial and/or educational operations in other #'(!urban or peri-urban areas with Mediterranean growing climatic conditions. Farms were located #')!in Davis and Santa Cruz, California (both approximately 110 km from Oakland, east and south, #'*!respectively) and Eugene, Oregon (830 km north of Oakland). They verified that our selected #(+!range of yields was realistic, depending on crop choice and management. #("!While the Toronto study calculated productivity based on Statistics Canada yield data #(#!unadjusted for losses, we followed the Detroit VWXG\Â¶VPHWKRGRIXVLQJ state and federal data to #($!calculate yields and farm to consumer losses at different stages in the commodity chain. The #(%!USDA database reports average estimated post-harvest losses at various stages between farm and #(&!table: farm to retail, retail to consumer, and inedible share (i.e., the portion of the raw vegetable, #('! 13!such as stems, that are not actually consumed). These farm-to-table losses are needed to calculate #((!the overall production required to meet both estimated current consumption and recommended #()!consumption levels.

Public land $"&!Overall, we identified roughly 1,200 ac (486.0 ha) of arable land on 495 aggregated sites $"'!consisting of 756 individual tax parcels (see Figure 3). Slightly more than half (629 ac, or 254.5 $"(!ha) of land identified in the inventory is currently owned or managed by OPR.

Such sites would be suitable for greenhouses or raised beds (or used $$%!for compost processing, distribution centers, and/or storage). The land is almost evenly divided $$&!between level (<10% slope), sloping (10 to 30%), and steep land (>30%). More than a third of $$'!the land (nearly 410 ac or 165.9 ha) is level (see Figure 3).

Private land $&'!Overall, we identified 3,008 privately owned vacant parcels, totaling 864 ac (349.6 ha) $&(!(see Figure 3).

The spectrum of land use scenarios therefore ranges $(*!from the improbable Scenario 1 (where all land would be used) to the potentially possible $)+!Scenario 4 where only 100 ac (14% of the total optimal vacant land) would be devoted to urban $)"!food production.

The project was $*%!initially inspired by a broad range of stakeholders, many of whom also contributed to the land $*&!inventory in an advisory capacity. Such integration of community participation is common in $*'!environmental justice research and policy advocacy (Costa et al., 2002; Metzger & Lendvay, $*(!2006; Petersen et al., 2006), reflecting the broader collaborative turn in planning (Innes & $*)!Booher, 2010). It also gives primacy to the co-production of science for healthy city planning, $**!what Corburn (2009, p. 11) GHVFULEHVDVDÂ³SRO\FHQWULFLQWHUDFWLYHDQGPXOWLSDUWLWHVKDULQJRI%++!LQIRUPDWLRQÂ´EULQJLQJWRJHWKHUUHVHDUFKHUVJovernment agencies, and lay publics. On a more %+"!immediate level, as Mendes et al. (2008) concluded in their comparative study of the Portland %+#!and Vancouver land inventories, the success of moving from land inventory to successful %+$!implementation of urban agriculture projects relies on the successful integration of stakeholders %+%!into the inventory and planning process. Indeed, the preliminary GIS inventory of public land %+&!that emerged from this project has played a role in ongoing efforts by city officials in Oakland to %+'!update urban agriculture zoning (McClintock et al., 2012). %+(!Furthermore, this study has both informed and built on other efforts to assess urban %+)!DJULFXOWXUHÂ¶VSRWHQWLDORQYDFDQWDQGXQGHUXWLOL]HGODQG in North American cities. The original %+*!CTC report provided methodological insights for several inventories that were conducted in %"+!other cities (Ackerman, 2012; Colasanti & Hamm, 2010; MacRae et al., 2010; Taggart et al., %""! 19!2009; Taylor & Lovell, 2012). Two of these studies, in turn, helped us refine our own %"#!consumption and productivity calculations. %"$! %"%!5.2. Limitations to the methodology %"&!This project VROHO\VRXJKWWRSURYLGHDURXJKÂ³EDFNRIWKHHQYHORSHÂ´HVWLPDWHRIXUEDQ%"'!DJULFXOWXUHÂ¶VSRWHQWLDOFRQWULEXWLRQWRWKHIRRGV\VWHP:KLOH the inventory was comprehensive, %"(!there are several limitations worth noting: %")! %"*!5.2.1. Data availability %#+!A primary limitation was the availability and currency of geospatial data. Even though %#"!the tax assessor data file was updated quarterly, there was a lag time before shape files were %##!updated to reflect the tax assessor data. Because of the dynamic nature of development plans and %#$!real estate transfers, each site would ideally be crosschecked with managing agencies and the %#%!online tax assessor database; time and labor constraints prevented us from doing so. As outside %#&!researchers without access to the tax assessor database, it was only possible to provide this %#'!Â³VQDSVKRWÂ´RIYDFDQWODQG at the time that the inventory was completed. A searchable Web GIS %#(!version of the inventory, ideally linked to the existing tax assessor database and updated %#)!immediately as sites are sold or transferred, could make current information available to the %#*!public in a more user-friendly fashion. %$+!The currency of aerial imagery was also an obstacle. When the CTC inventory was %$"!completed, only 2005 NAIP imagery was available, thus the visual record of land use was %$#!already four years old. To account for this, we crosschecked all sites using Google Maps to see if %$$!they had been developed in the interim. While we were able to then delete newly developed sites %$%! 20!from the inventory, we were unable to account for slight changes in vegetation. New NAIP %$&!imagery, flown in Summer 2009, was released after we had completed the majority of the GIS %$'!analysis of the public land. The release of ArcGIS 10, which includes up to date Bing basemap %$(!imagery, greatly expedited our analysis of private land. For analysts using Quantum GIS, %$)!GRASS, or other open source software, NAIP imagery is a free alternative, but may have slightly %$*!lower resolution than Bing or Google imagery. %%+! %%"!5.2.2. Visual interpretation %%#!The study also revealed the limitations of visual interpretation. Even with 1-m resolution, %%$!what appears to be arable in an aerial or satellite-photo may not hold up to ground-truthing. The %%%!annual grasses of the Bay Area turn a golden brown color during the dry season, making it %%&!difficult to distinguish them from bare dirt or concrete at some sites. While ground-truthing of %%'!34% of the publicly owned sites confirmed that our estimates were 96% accurate, further %%(!comprehensive assessment of sites should be conducted to determine if all of them are actually %%)!viable for food production. Indeed, ground-truthing ultimately prompted us to hone the slope %%*!analysis in 2010 to better identify slopes that might be too steep to farm. %&+!Another major drawback of our approach was its labor intensiveness. Visual assessment %&"!of each parcel was incredibly time consuming, and clipping out vegetation and buildings and %&#!other reshaping of polygons added a significant level of precision to the project. The HOPE %&$!mini-grant funded 140 hours of GIS work, but we easily spent twice this amount of time %&%!inventorying the publicly owned land. The private land inventory was completed much more %&&!quickly because the Bing base map allowed us to eliminate the extra step of cross checking each %&'!site against Google Maps. The use of remote sensing software to process aerial imagery could %&(! 21!certainly speed up the process, but would be complicated by shading from buildings and %&)!differentiating dry vegetation from other surfaces. Using higher resolution imagery for the entire %&*!city would also require significant data processing capabilities. Indeed, recent land inventories %'+!using remote sensing have extrapolated their results from small sub-sections of the city (Nipen, %'"!2009; Welty, 2010). %'#! %'$!5.2.3. Estimating production and consumption %'%!There are limitations to calculating vegetable consumption (and by extension, necessary %'&!production) at the city- or neighborhood-scale. Interpolating consumption based on national %''!averages is clearly problematic, especially when the demographics of poverty, race, and %'(!ethnicityÂ²all of which factor into food consumption patternsÂ²differ between the municipal and %')!national scale. Vegetable consumption is closely correlated to education and income, with %'*!significant differences in consumption between races and/or ethnic groups (Casagrande, Wang, %(+!Anderson, & Gary, 2007). Given the socioeconomic disparity between the flatlands and hills, %("!consumption patterns are surely even different within Oakland (hence the activism that has %(#!emerged to address these inequities). Considering that 22% RI2DNODQGÂ¶VSRSXODWLRQOLYHVLQ%($!poverty relative to 15% nationally (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010), the quanity of vegetables %(%!actually consumed is likely lower than aggregate USDA data suggests. %(&!)XUWKHUPRUHWKH86'$DYHUDJHVOLNHO\GRQRWUHIOHFW2DNODQGÂ¶VHWKQLFÂ²and culinaryÂ²%('!diversity; the culinary traditions and diets RIWKHFLW\Â¶VODUJH$VLDQDQG/DWLQRSRSXODWLons (17% %((!and 25% RIWKHFLW\Â¶VSRSXODWLRQUHVSHFWLYHO\YHUVXV% and 16% of the US population) are %()!rich in many vegetables that are not represented in the USDA dataset. A more accurate estimate %(*!would require finer grain, in-depth consumption surveys stratified along socioeconomic lines. %)+! 22!This would also help to reveal the full spectrum of crop varieties that people actually consume in %)"!Oakland. %)#!In terms of production, estimates of the local/seasonal share of crop production should be %)$!fine-tuned using crop yield data specific to East Bay urban agroecosystems. No such data %)%!currently exists in any comprehensive form. Moreover, not all vegetables would grow equally %)&!well at every site, given site-specific soil quality and micro-climatic conditions. Such variability %)'!would need to be considered once actual sites were selected. Because existing soil maps are too %)(!coarse to capture such variability at the site scale, we did not include a soil assessment in our %))!GIS analysis. %)*!Moreover, our three yield scenarios are realistic only if gardens were to be managed with %*+!a level of professional attention to spacing, planting, weeding, irrigation, pest control, and %*"!harvest. Community and school gardens that are not tended with the same level of care are %*#!unlikely to attain such yields. Scenario 4 (100 ac devoted to urban agriculture) is arguably the %*$!most realistic in that it represents a scale that City of Oakland officials might consider given %*%!conflicting stakeholder needs (an issue we address in the Conclusion) and/or the difficulty they %*&!might face in securing potential commercial or non-profit farm managers to farm a larger area. %*'!Finally, our production estimates incorporate USDA loss estimates that are likely higher %*(!than what might occur in a localized food system. Indeed, they reflect the average losses for %*)!vegetables that travel more than 1,000 miles on average from farm to plate (Weber & Matthews, %**!2008). Under a localized production system where more produce is sold at farm stands and &++!farmeUVÂ¶PDUNHWV and less weight loss to processing, we might assume lower rates of loss &+"!between retail and consumer. For this reason, our overall production estimates are likely &+#!conservative. &+$! 23! &+%!5.3. Future directions &+&!This study represents only a preliminary step in an ongoing effort to expand urban &+'!agriculture in Oakland. The next step would be to prioritize site suitability. The sites identified in &+(!this inventory were categorized based on size, slope, and aspect. While information on ground &+)!cover, presence of a water meter, accessibility to public transportation, and proximity to schools &+*!were included with each site listed in the Land Locator, these factors (selected by the advisory &"+!committee) were not used to rank site suitability; rather, they were simply presented as relevant &""!data to help guide such decisions. A prioritization or ranking of sites for suitability should &"#!include some or all of these factors, as well as others such as soil quality, tenure, access, and &"$!waste disposal (Unger and Wooten 2006). &"%!Soil quality, in particular, is an issue in urban areas. Many urban soils have high levels of &"&!lead (Pb) and other contaminants. This project led to the assessment of Pb at more than a &"'!hundred sites identified in this inventory. Results indicated that Pb levels are lower than expected &"(!across the city, but that levels are highly variable at each site and are dependent on a number of &")!variables including soil type, density of pre-1940s housing, distance to major roads, and levels of &"*!soil carbon and soil phosphorus (McClintock, 2012). This data, along with EPA Brownfields and &#+!California Department of Toxic Substances Control data, should figure centrally in future site &#"!suitability assessment. Other indicators of soil quality, such as soil organic matter, cation &##!exchange capacity, clay content, and nutrient availability would also be useful. In many cases, &#$!however, construction of raised beds and/or the importation of soil and compost may mitigate &#%!many soil quality issues. &#&! 24!Since the completion of the CTC inventory in 2009, several other land inventories have &#'!been released. Each of these inventories includes additional variables that could be incorporated &#(!into a finer grain analysis and that could help to narrow the overall suitability of a particular site. &#)!Some of these analyses are more dependent on high-resolution geospatial data than others. The &#*!Halifax inventory, for example, uses LiDAR data to model potential sun exposure at different &$+!times of day in potential backyard gardens in several sample neighborhoods, and reports an &$"!additional 22% loss of available space due to shading (Nipen, 2009). A Somerville &$#!(Massachusetts) inventory includes soil type and population density in the analysis (Bickerdike, &$$!DiLisio, Haskin, McCullagh, & Pierce-Quinonez, 2010). One Cleveland inventory, conducted by &$%!the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Food Policy Coalition, includes presence of hydrological &$&!features and soil, as well as proximity to community gardens greenhouses and other consumer &$'!markets (Taggart et al., 2009). Furthermore, it excludes industrial and brownfields sites, as does &$(!the New York assessment (Ackerman, 2012). &$)!With the exception of a recent Cleveland study (Grewal & Grewal, 2012), vacant land &$*!inventories to date have not included economic variables. A suite of economic indicators such as &%+!parcel values, crop values, job creation, and infrastructure costs would be necessary to conduct &%"!cost-benefit analyses to compare urban agriculture to other land uses. At the same time, such an &%#!econometric analysis would likely fail to capture the multipleÂ²but difficult or impossible to &%$!quantifyÂ²attributes that make parks and other green space valuable in urban landscapes, notably &%%!the aesthetic, recreational, educational, and health benefits offered by such spaces. &%&! &%'!6.

It will surely take a long time for cultivation to reach the 100 or 500 ac as &&+!envisioned in the Low and High land use scenarios presented above. Ultimately, the delineation &&"!of polygons is only a preliminary step in the long process of mapping the agricultural potential of &&#!a city such as Oakland. Indeed, the politics of negotiating competing uses of vacant land is far &&$!more complex than identifying potential sites of production. The real work in planning for urban &&%!agriculture lies in identifying and negotiating the varied interests of multiple stakeholders. &&&!As in any case of multiple land uses, such conflicting interests may hinder urban &&'!agriculture at a particular site. For example, people who use the site for walking dogs, playing &&(!Frisbee, flying kites, or picnicking would likely object to its conversion to agricultural use. &&)!Similarly, Â³QRW-in-my-EDFN\DUGÂ´1,0%<VHQWLPHQWVIURPQHLJKERUVFRQFHUQHGRYHUQRLVH&&*!human or vehicle traffic, odors from compost or manure, or impact on property values may &'+!prove a challenge to cultivation at particular sites. These conflicting interests and concerns must &'"!figure centrally into public discussions over how much and which land to devote to urban &'#!agriculture. In Oakland, all projects proposed on OPR land, for example, are required to go &'$!through a lengthy approval process that includes several public comment periods where such &'%!conflicts are heard. &'&!The cultivation of private land ultimately depends on the will of the landowner. &''!Municipalities have little control over how a vacant parcel is to be used other than easing zoning &'(!and permitting restrictions on urban agriculture (McClintock et al., 2012) or incentivizing &')!landowners to convert their property to agricultural use. A municipal government could waive &'*!blight fines or provide property tax credits, for example, for vacant property owners allowing &(+! 26!cultivation on their property, a policy exemplified by Maryland House Bill 1062 (Property Tax &("!Credit: Urban Agricultural Property) signed into law in May 2010. &(#!While negotiating stakeholder interests ultimately determines how much vacant land is &($!used for urban agriculture, a vacant land inventory can help not only to identify possible &(%!locations and posit their potential contribution to the food system, but can also help to embed the &(&!socioecological landscape with alternative possibilities, a first step in realizing a vision of what &('!an alternative food system might look like.

Ground-truthing for the majority of sites was conducted during a related project funded by a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (#1003598). The project was also made possible by dissertation fellowship funding from the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Institute for the Study of Social Change, and Community Forestry & Environmental Research Partnerships. We would like to extend our tremendous gratitude to the members of the Community Advisory Committee and the HOPE Collaborative Food Systems Action Team (too numerous to name here) for their timely input and recommendations.
