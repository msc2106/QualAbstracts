ABSTRACT: 
This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary project that has revealed the location, extent and character of the winter camp of the Viking Great Army at Torksey, Lincolnshire, of AD 872–3. The camp lay within a naturally defended area of higher ground, partially surrounded by marshes and bordered by the River Trent on its western side. It is considerably larger than the Viking camp of 873–4 previously excavated at Repton, Derbyshire, and lacks the earthwork defences identified there. Several thousand individuals overwintered in the camp, including warriors, craftworkers and merchants. An exceptionally large and rich metalwork assemblage was deposited during the Great Army’s overwintering, and metal processing and trading was undertaken. There is no evidence for a pre-existing Anglo-Saxon trading site here; the site appears to have been chosen for its strategic location and its access to resources. In the wake of the overwintering, Torksey developed as an important Anglo-Saxon borough with a major wheel-thrown pottery industry and multiple churches and cemeteries. The Torksey evidence allows for a radical reappraisal of the character of Viking winter camps, and the legacy of the Viking Great Army for Anglo-Saxon England.

It is considerably larger than the Viking camp of873–4 previously excavated at Repton, Derbyshire, and lacks the earthwork defences identifiedthere. Several thousand individuals overwintered in the camp, including warriors, craftworkers andmerchants. An exceptionally large and rich metalwork assemblage was deposited during the GreatArmy’s overwintering, and metal processing and trading was undertaken. There is no evidence for apre-existing Anglo-Saxon trading site here; the site appears to have been chosen for its strategiclocation and its access to resources. In the wake of the overwintering, Torksey developed as animportant Anglo-Saxon borough with a major wheel-thrown pottery industry and multiple churchesand cemeteries. The Torksey evidence allows for a radical reappraisal of the character of Vikingwinter camps, and the legacy of the Viking Great Army for Anglo-Saxon England.BACKGROUNDFrom AD 865 to 879 a Viking army wreaked havoc on the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, leading topolitical conquest, settlement on a substantial scale and extensive Scandinavian culturaland linguistic influence in eastern and northern England. This critical period for Englishhistory was followed by revolutionary changes in land ownership, society and economy,including the growth of towns and industry, while transformations in power politics wouldultimately see the rise of Wessex as the pre-eminent kingdom of Anglo-Saxon England. Yetdespite the pivotal role of the so-called Great Army (micel here) in these events, little isknown of it; documentary sources provide few insights into its activities and intentions, andarchaeological evidence has largely remained elusive. The size of the army and thescale of subsequent settlement have been disputed, but the debate about the impact ofScandinavian raiders and settlers is typically informed by evidence that has widely differinglevels of chronological resolution and relates to diverse social, economic and politicalcontexts; scholars have long struggled to integrate this evidence effectively.1©TheAntiquaries Journal, 2016.

University of Sheffield Library, on 09 Nov 2016 at 16:28:14, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available atThis paper provides a fresh perspective on the Viking Great Army and its impacton Anglo-Saxon England, based on new tightly dated and contextualised evidencefrom Torksey. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle tells us that in late AD 872 ‘the army wentinto Northumbria, and it took up winter quarters at Torksey, in Lindsey; and then theMercians made peace with the army’.2 While it has long been assumed that this occurredin the vicinity of the present-day village of Torksey, on the River Trent c 14km northwest of Lincoln, only now has the site of the Viking winter camp been precisely locatedand its extent established. Torksey offers a unique research opportunity as both thecamp and the adjacent urban settlement that developed in the wake of the overwinteringare unencumbered by later development. Hence from 2011 to 2015 we undertookan archaeological evaluation at Torksey as part of a wider research agenda to examinethe impact of ninth-century Viking armies, to illuminate their scale, complexity andintentions, and to provide new insights into the relationship between raiding, politicalconquest and settlement.THE VIKING GREAT ARMYThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the Great Army landed in East Anglia in 865.3 Thiswas evidently larger than any previous Viking force and it became a constant threat, as itstayed in England through the winter. Over the following years it engaged in battle acrosseastern and northern England, leading each of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to ‘make peace’,as the Chronicle puts it. This is doubtless how the Army acquired many of the resources andallies it needed for a sustained campaign that marked a change in tactics from previousintermittent raids.4 Viking armies had overwintered before – on the Isle of Thanet, in themouth of the Thames, in 850 and on the Isle of Sheppey, in Kent, in 855 – but these wereapparently isolated episodes on coastal sites.5The new force appears to have embarked on aphase of political conquest in which it exploited internecine warfare and played a role inappointing new kings from among its newly acquired allies drawn from the local elite.6 Thedecade or so from 865 witnessed the transformation of the Great Army from raiders tosettlers, hastening the demise of the separate kingdoms of Mercia, East Anglia andNorthumbria. In 876, one force ‘shared out the land of the Northumbrians, and theyproceeded to plough and support themselves’, and another force settled in Mercia in 877.7The remainder of the Great Army, led by Guthrum, was defeated in 878 by theWest Saxonsunder Alfred at Edington, inWiltshire. As part of the ensuing peace negotiations, Guthrumand thirty of his warriors were baptised; then, in 880, the Army went to East Anglia ‘andsettled there and shared out the land’.8 Subsequently, Guthrum and Alfred famouslyengaged in the making of a treaty, dividing out their areas of jurisdiction, and makingarrangements for relations between their followers concerning legal disputes, trade and the2.

Coins were minted in Guthrum’s realm, on some of which he used hisbaptismal name ofÆthelstan. These initiatives were part of the process by which Guthrumbecame a king in a western European guise.9Yet despite the importance of this pivotal period in Anglo-Saxon history, the army thatprecipitated these changes is poorly understood. The size of Viking armies has been muchdebated, especially following Peter Sawyer’s attempts some fifty years ago to challengeprevious assumptions about the large scale of the Viking onslaught. Sawyer argued thattranslating the term here as ‘army’ was misleading; it was used in the early seventh-centurylaws of King Ine to mean any group numbering more than thirty-five men: ‘If a here couldbe three dozen men, it would be as well not to call it an “army”’. He maintained that theChronicle exaggerated the numbers of ships involved in Viking raids, and argued that thedifficulty of keeping a large army in the field precluded Viking armies comprising more thana few hundred men.10Sawyer also attempted to mobilise archaeological evidence. However, he relied onantiquarian speculation about possible Viking encampments in his argument for the smallsize of the armies; since the sites concerned were undated, they did not readily support hiscase without some circularity of argument. For example, in the 1920s Sir Cyril Fox haddismissed the notion that the earthwork known as Gannock’s Castle was the site of theViking winter camp of 917 recorded at Tempsford (Bedfordshire), because at c 120× 84ft(c 37× 26m) it would only have accommodated around 270 men. However, Sawyerargued that there was ‘no reason to think that the herementioned by the Chronicle was muchlarger than this’. In contrast, in 1903, Isaac Chalkley Gould had identified an earthworksome 500 yards (457m) long as the fortress built by a Viking army in 893 at Shoebury(Essex), and Sawyer explained the larger size by describing it as a place ‘intended toshelter the women, ships and property of the raiders during campaigns and… the men andhorses as well’.11Nicholas Brooks subsequently demonstrated the flaw in Sawyer’s insistence that theAnglo-Saxon Chronicle is an unreliable witness to the numbers of ships that Viking raidscomprised. He showed that the Chronicle is, in fact, notably restrained in its assessments ofthe scale of most of the raids and, moreover, that the estimates of the numbers of ships –sometimes 300 or more – are corroborated by Frankish, Irish and Spanish Muslim sources:‘the Chronicle’s figures for Viking fleets are neither random nor wild; they avoid the obviousexaggerations of less well-placed or more colourful continental sources, and they mostly fita consistent pattern of Viking activity that is credible and circumstantial’.12 Brooks alsoargued that the Great Army was more successful than contemporary Viking armies raidingon the continent, because it was demonstrably larger than those armies. It was this that ledto the ‘shattering effect which they achieved’ on Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and the Church.13While there was still no reliable archaeological evidence concerning the encampments ofViking armies, Brooks drew attention to the documentary evidence suggesting that theGreat Army typically based itself at the royal and administrative centres of the Anglo-Saxonkingdoms, chosen ‘precisely because they already had defences’, some of them substantialRoman fortifications.14 He concluded that the size of the places the army chose as their9.

Yet although the Chronicle records the overwintering sites, this hasproven only partially helpful for locating and exploring Viking encampments; in somecases it is unhelpfully vague (eg ‘East Anglia’ in 865–6), and even where a precise locationis named, modern development has rendered the sites archaeologically inaccessible(eg York in 866–7 and 868–9, Nottingham in 867–8, Thetford in 869–70, Reading in 870–1and London in 871–2).16There are, however, two exceptions: Torksey (872–3) and Repton(873–4).Excavations and geophysical survey by Martin Biddle and Birthe Kjølbye-Biddle atRepton (1974–93) identified a substantial ditch, some 4m deep, which formed a relativelysmall D-shaped enclosure, c 0.4ha in size.17 This did nothing to challenge the view thatViking armies can only have been numbered in the hundreds.18 Four furnished graves wereassociated with the recorded overwintering, while excavation of a former mausoleumrecovered the disarticulated remains of at least 264 individuals, among which 82 per cent ofthe sexed bones were male and described as ‘robust’. Radiocarbon dating suggested thatthese remains dated to no later than the late ninth century, and the deposit was interpretedas at least partly comprising members of the Great Army. Other than some indication ofdamage inflicted on the church, investigations at Repton revealed little more of the activitiesof the Great Army, but this can now be seen as a reflection of the lack of metal detector andlandscape survey.19 Nonetheless, for a generation Repton has served as the prototype forViking encampments.20 At Torksey our project now offers a different perspective. We havesecurely identified the precise location of the overwintering of 872–3 through a programmeof archaeological evaluation and the plotting of an exceptional concentration of metalwork,including ingots, hack-metal and coinage (fig 1). Our work has also revealed that thecamp was c 55ha in extent, considerably larger than that identified at Repton, andcharacterised by a wider range of activities. Important as the excavations at Repton remain,the scale and character of this new evidence from Torksey forces a radical reappraisal of theViking Great Army.The new insights fromTorksey are timely given recent work on comparable sites in bothEngland and Ireland. Metal-detecting, excavation and landscape survey have revealed thelocation of another, as yet unpublished, winter camp at Aldwark, north of York.21 This isnot a documented winter camp, but on the basis of the date of the metalwork, it has been15.

The site extended over an area of c 31ha, surrounded by a sub-rectangularditched enclosure, possibly of early medieval date. Limited landscape analysis has revealedthat the site was on higher ground above the flood plain of the River Ouse and that wind-blown deposits may have obscured any archaeological features.23The Annals of Ulster record the locations at which Viking armies in Ireland were based,sometimes describing them as longphuirt (plural for ‘ship-place’ or ‘ship-harbour’), with theearliest recorded being at Lough Neagh (Northern Ireland) in 840 and Dublin in 841.Whether the longphort should be regarded as a specific monument type has been extensivelydebated, but recent work has begun to identify their locations through excavation, surveyand recognition of a suite of morphological and locational characteristics.24 Fieldwork atAnnagassan (Co. Louth) has illuminated the longphort constructed at Linn Duachaill in841. Geophysical survey and excavation has identified a rampart, comprising a bank andditch, of c 245m running from the River Glyde to the sea, and cutting off a 1.18km-longsection of the peninsula.

Waterford) has presented evi-dence for a Viking encampment. It is not specifically recorded as a longphort, although thispart of Ireland is poorly represented in surviving documentary sources, and excavationsuggests that it was occupied for a longer period of time than other sites discussed in thispaper, from the mid-ninth century until the early to mid-tenth century. Two adjacentD-shaped enclosures encompass c 2.91ha, and evidence for iron-working, silver-working,glass-working, ship repair and trade has been identified. A burial containing weaponry hasalso been excavated.26AIMS AND METHODSOver the last twenty years, several thousand pieces of early medieval metalwork and coinshave been recovered bymetal detector users from six fields to the north of the modern villageof Torksey.27These finds first came to scholarly attention in the 1990s, and in his overview ofAnglo-Saxon Lincolnshire they were interpreted by Sawyer as evidence for a market or fair ofeighth- and ninth-century date, albeit that he accepted that ‘some of the ninth-century coinswere probably brought by Vikings’.28 Torksey was described by Katharina Ulmschneider in2000 as a ‘very productive’ site. At that time, so-called ‘productive’ sites, characterised byunusual concentrations of coins and other metalwork of the Middle Anglo-Saxon period,were increasingly being discovered in eastern England by metal-detecting.29 However, in apaper published two years later, Mark Blackburn highlighted the concentration of ninth-century coins, which implied ‘a period of exceptional activity at Torksey’, and he linked thefinds, which then included eleven Arabic dirhams as well as hack-metal, ingots and copper-alloy weights, with the Viking overwintering of 872–3, although the precise locations in theparish from which the material was coming were unknown to him.30 An updated list of findswas published in 2011, by which time it was apparent that most of the eighth-century coinswere not from the site of the winter camp, now identified as ‘several ploughed fields adjoiningthe Trent’.31 Blackburn estimated that the finds were coming from an area of c 26ha, but ourfieldwork indicates that the size of the camp was, in fact, nearer to 55ha (fig 2).32In order to set this exceptional metal-detected assemblage in context, we haveundertaken a five-year programme of archaeological investigation employing a variety oftechniques, including geophysical survey, fieldwalking, environmental analysis and small-scale excavation. By overlaying the various forms of evidence, it is possible to make sense ofthe different categories of data. Our aims have been to define the location and scale of thecamp, its physical nature and organisation, the activities undertaken there and its legacy.We have asked why the Viking army chose the site, and examined its relationship to any25.

Our project has major implications for the widerunderstanding of Viking armies, their strategies and composition, and their interaction withlocal populations as well as the subsequent revolutionary changes in Late Saxon potteryindustries and the development of Anglo-Saxon towns.The project aims have been addressed via eight specific objectives, employing a multi-disciplinary team of archaeologists, geomorphologists, numismatists and historians, and byusing a range of techniques:1. Geoarchaeological investigation of the winter camp and its environs, employingauguring, test pitting, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and pollenanalysis, to understand the nature and development of the landscape, and allow us tovisualise its likely appearance on the eve of the arrival of the Viking Great Army.2. Geophysical survey of the winter camp to identify archaeological features associatedwith the Viking camp and with other phases of activity.3. Fieldwalking and geo-referenced metal-detector survey within the Viking camp toidentify and date activity foci.4. Trial and test-pit excavations to assess the visibility and depth of buriedarchaeological features within the winter camp.5. Concordance and cataloguing of the metal-detected finds known to be from theViking camp (with a cut-off date of August 2015) to integrate a range of disparatesources.6. Fieldwalking and geophysical survey of Castle Field, within the Anglo-Saxonborough, to investigate the Torksey pottery industry.7. Petrological thin-section study of the pottery and its clay sources to help understandthe industry and inform broader issues of its relationship to the winter camp andborough.8. Assessment and radiocarbon dating of the excavated cemeteries in Torksey tounderstand their relationship to the winter camp and borough.The focus of this paper is on the winter camp itself (objectives 1–5), as our study of theTorksey pottery industry is being published separately,35 although reference is made to thekey outcomes of the other objectives (6–8) where they illuminate the camp and its impact.A searchable and illustrated database of all early medieval finds, and reports covering allobjectives, are included in the digital archive, curated by the Archaeology Data Service;together with the current paper, they offer a full and up-to-date catalogue of all themetal-detected finds.36 A selection of these finds have been discussed in previouspublications,37 but our project has collated published sources, current Portable Antiquities33.

This was a strategically important nodal point in the regional trans-port network, just south of a crossing point over the river, from which the Roman road nowknown as Till Bridge Lane ran south east to join Ermine Street just north of Lincoln.39 Inthe medieval period (and probably earlier), Torksey was on a key transport route from thesouth to York, as travellers transferred from road to river at this point; according toDomesday Book, its inhabitants had the special responsibility of accompanying royalmessengers to York ‘with their ships and their means of navigation’.40 The position ofTorksey within reach, should the need arise, of Northumbria and the heart of Mercia isstriking. The Trent would have provided access to the Midlands and, downstream, to theHumber estuary and thence to York or the North Sea.41 This facilitated movement of thearmy between the kingdoms, but also allowed control over other travellers into and out ofMercia. It is also possible that waterborne access into Lindsey was controlled fromTorksey,as it is located adjacent to the Foss Dyke, a canal of probable Roman construction, whichconnects the Trent to Lincoln. Although we cannot be certain that it was navigable in theninth century, the transportation of pottery produced at Torksey to Lincoln in the followingcentury suggests that it was open by then.42The current channel of the Trent does not necessarily correspond with its early medievalcourse. It is likely, however, that climatic deterioration from the fourth to the tenthcenturies led to the formation of an unstable, multi-channelled fluvial system with semi-permanent wetlands across the wider valley floor, interspersed with areas of raised groundformed by the Mercia Mudstone and sand and gravel islands. Our programme of coringand radiocarbon dating of peat sequences to the east of the winter camp has revealed thatthere had been a palaeochannel of the Trent up until the Bronze Age, when upstreamsiltation cut it off from the river, and peat deposits began to form.43 Without an activechannel, and with water levels averaging 1–2m higher than they are today, the low groundeast of the camp would have remained a wetland, allowing peat to accumulate into the earlymedieval period (fig 3 [2]). Sediment mapping to the north and south of the site revealednot peat but silt (fig 3 [1 and 4]), suggesting that these areas remained open to the Trent,which would have provided naturally occurring seasonal tidal ports, with gently sloping38. Metal-detected evidence has transformed our understanding of Viking Age England (Richardset al 2009), but has hitherto been largely discussed without reference to context (eg Kershaw2013) or on a smaller scale (eg Richards et al 1999).39. Whitwell 1992, 50.40. Sawyer 1998, 18; Foster and Longley 1924, 11.41. Edwards and Hindle 1991, 128, argue that the Trent was navigable as far upstream as Burton-upon-Trent in Staffordshire.42.

The area to the north of thesite would have flooded regularly with the tidal influx of the Trent, as it continues to do tothe present day when the Trent is in flood (fig 3 [4]). Indeed, the place name ‘Marton’comes from the Old English mere-tūn, meaning ‘pool farm’, arguably derived from itsposition on the Trent flood plain.44 Modern land management, including the digging ofdrainage channels and the installation of a pump-house at Marton in the nineteenthcentury, has had a significant impact, and geoarchaeological analysis was essential indetermining the landscape setting of the winter camp.45In the winter of 872–3, bounded to the west by the Trent and surrounded by wet andmarshy ground, the site of the Viking campwas effectively an island.

Although thehighest point is only c 10m higher than the modern village, this is a significant difference in thecontext of the surrounding landscape. The vantage point offered by the elevated location,combinedwith access to the Trent, must havemade it particularly attractive to theGreat Army.Viking armies are frequently recorded as occupying islands, including Thanet (Kent) in 850,Sheppey (Kent) in 855, an unnamed island in the River Colne (Hertfordshire) in 893 and anisland calledMersea out in the sea off the Essex coast in 894.46On the continent Viking armiesare also known to have based themselves on islands inmajor rivers, and the advantages that thisoffered are suggested in a late ninth-century account byAdrevaldus, amonk fromFleuryAbbey(France), of a Viking army on an island in the Loire where they ‘held crowds of prisoners inFig 3.

Themost striking anomalies were found in the centre of the transect, where thedata indicate a post-medieval rabbit warren and a complex of rectilinear enclosures locatedFig 4.

Analysis of pollen from peatdeposits east of the winter camp suggests that woodland clearance accelerated in theRomano-British period, probably associated with the establishment of the farmsteadidentified by themagnetometer survey. By the time the Vikings arrived in 872–3, most of theformer dunes probably appeared as wide mounds of sandy ground interspersed with theterrace gravels and clay mudstone.55 It is suspected that the deposits of windblown sand,which have continued to build up and move since the Viking Age, have obscured detectionof archaeology that, even under ideal conditions, can be expected to demonstrate com-paratively weak magnetic contrasts with the surrounding soil. Such deposits may, however,have positive implications, ensuring the survival of the archaeology intact beneath the reachFig 6.

The gradiometer survey found no evidence of a defensive ditch, such asthat detected with excavation and geophysical techniques at Repton.57 It is, of course,conceivable that any such ditch at Torksey was masked by windblown sand, but such adefensive measure may have been unnecessary when one considers the naturally defensiblelocation of the site.THE METALWORK ASSEMBLAGEThe windblown sand contains one of the richest assemblages of early medieval findsknown from the British Isles. It is estimated that over the last twenty years some seventymetal-detector users have been working the site of the winter camp. The majorityFig 7.

Many have beenlogged by the PAS and, given the wide area from which the detectorists have been drawn toTorksey, objects have been reported to a number of finds liaison officers, including those inSheffield, Derby, Lincoln, Scunthorpe and York. A major task of the assessment hasbeen to update the catalogue of finds provided by Blackburn and to develop a databaseof all 1,572 known finds recovered before August 2015 (table 1).58 The largest proportion(36 per cent) has been logged by the PAS; 18 per cent are in the Fitzwilliam Museum,Cambridge; 24 per cent are in a variety of other locations, including Lincoln Museumand private collections; and a growing number (currently 22 per cent) are from our ownmetal-detector survey. The site of the winter camp continues to be subject to modernagricultural practices, including deep ploughing, which regularly brings fresh objects to thesurface. Nonetheless, the current landowners are in favour of controlling the detecting andaccess is now limited to a small number of detectorists, who have been logging the locationof their finds with hand-held GPS. Since 2011 all new finds have been plotted. Althoughthere is a scatter of Roman andmedieval finds (as is common inmost areas of Lincolnshire),the majority of objects (58 per cent) are early medieval (fig 9). Around 38 per cent of thesefinds are copper alloy, with 37 per cent lead, 20 per cent silver and very small proportions ofgold and iron (fig 10). Apart from the under-representation of iron, which is not generallycollected by the detectorists, the sample appears to be broadly representative of theFig 8. The TORK13 test trench looking east58.

Similarly, although distributions of finds by type sofar indicate undifferentiated activities, the overall number of geo-referenced finds is stillrelatively small. Nonetheless, the area of the Roman farmstead, as revealed throughgeophysics, is certainly confirmed by the distribution of Roman finds (fig 12). The onlypossible indication of zoning of activities during the overwintering comes from the distributionof lead gaming pieces (fig 13), which cluster towards the northern part of the site and mayprovide the best indication of domestic areas, although we can map the find-spots of onlytwenty of more than 280 pieces recovered.Table 1.

More than350 early medieval coins have been recovered, including forty English silver pennies, with anotable concentration from the 860s and early 870s (fig 14), which is striking given that coinfinds of the early ninth century are generally more prolific than those of the middle andlater parts of the century.59 Remarkably, there are also more than 170 Northumbriancopper-alloy stycas, which did not circulate widely outside Northumbria and are generallyonly recovered in Lincolnshire as single finds.60 Most of these were struck in the 840s,particularly during the reign of Aethelred II (840–4, 844–8) of Northumbria. There are alsoeleven late stycas of Osberht (died 867), probably dating towards the end of AnglianNorthumbria. The concentration of stycas at Torksey suggests that they had remained incirculation and had been brought there directly from Northumbria, from where theGreat Army had retired to Torksey.61 Indeed, stycas are increasingly being identified inScandinavian contexts in Britain, including settlements, hoards and burials, and ninetystycas have been recovered from Aldwark.62There are also 124 dirhams from Torksey, the largest concentration on any insularsite (fig 15). These had all been cut into smaller fractions, indicating that they had beenretained for their silver content rather than their monetary value.63 These dirhams hadclearly been brought to England from the Middle East via Scandinavia, and similarFig 14.

The English silver coinshave an end-date in the early 870s, and they are likely to have been lost close totheir date of production, as there is no evidence for pecking to test for quality.Archibald has argued that the most likely context for the introduction of pecking,first demonstrated in hoards dated to after c 890, was the reform of coinage in the mid-870s,when the silver content of new issues was increased, yet earlier issues continuedto circulate.67 Allowing for the time it would have taken for the dirhams to reachEngland, they appear to have an end-date remarkably similar to that of the English silvercoins in the early 870s (fig 16). In summary, it is clear that the early medieval coins canonly have been brought to the site by the Great Army, given the combination of silvercoins of the 860s and early 870s, dirhams used as bullion and the exceptional concentrationof stycas outside Northumbria.Fig 15.

University of Sheffield Library, on 09 Nov 2016 at 16:28:14, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available atA handful of Middle Anglo-Saxon finds and a few late tenth-century dress accessorieshave been recovered from the same fields, but in insufficient amounts to suggest significant,if any, earlier or later settlement. Fourteen late seventh- to early eighth-century sceattashave been found, but this is a far smaller assemblage than is generally associated withMiddle Anglo-Saxon trading sites. The character of the vast majority of the other metalartefacts is consistent, as we shall see, with them having been brought to the site, or pro-duced there, by the Great Army. We are confident, therefore, that the exceptional assem-blage of finds from Torksey largely represents a single year of activity, which may be linkedexactly to the overwintering of 872–3 recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.ACTIVITIES IN THE CAMPAt first sight the amount of metalwork recovered from the camp seems remarkable as thereflection of a single overwintering, yet it is clear that in certain circumstances single eventscan lead to massive accumulations of material; the detritus left by more recent armies – oreven on modern music festival campsites – reminds us how easy it is to mislay items inmuddy and trampled fields. The fact that even gold and silver objects were not recovered atthe time indicates the sheer quantity of portable wealth that must have been collected by theArmy. The assemblage is invaluable in contributing to our understanding of what a Vikingarmy did while it was overwintering, including trade and exchange, coin production andmetal processing, as well as leisure activities.Trade and exchangeThat Viking armies were accompanied by individuals involved in trade is suggested by the findsfrom Torksey. This should not be a surprise, as it is revealed in continental texts.For example, theAnnals of St-Bertin record that in 873 a Viking army besieged by Frankish forcesFig 16.

There was evidently an important role for bullion, as is clear from the fragmentedstate of the dirhams, the presence of sixty pieces of hack-silver (fig 17), and themixed profile ofthe coins – from three Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, the continent and the Arabic world. In thiscontext, Anglo-Saxon, Irish and Scandinavian fragmentary decorative silver jewellery can alsobe interpreted as having been used for monetary exchange.69 Taken together, this evidencereinforces the impression of the operation of a bullion-based economy that emerges from themany Viking silver hoards of the late ninth and early tenth centuries. Most of these are ageneration later than the finds from Torksey, but an exception is the hoard from Croydon(Surrey), consisting of hack-silver, ingots and c 250 coins from Mercia, Wessex and the con-tinent, plus three dirhams. This has been dated to c 872 and associated with the movement ofthe Great Army to London in the winter of 871–2.70 More recently, a hoard fromWatlington(Oxfordshire), comprising 186 coins, seven items of jewellery and fifteen ingots, has beendated to the late 870s following the defeat of the Viking army at Edington.71Hack-silver, silveringots and imported coins have also been found atWoodstown and Aldwark, suggesting that aFig 17.

Several pieces had been chisel-cut from gold ingots, although one twistedpiece may have been cut from an arm- or neck-ring. Two cut gold solidi – one Frisian,the other Carolingian – may also have been bullion. This is an important insight intoViking activity because, unlike hack-silver and silver ingots, gold in any form rarelyoccurs in Viking Age hoards in Britain, and it has been suggested that this is in part becauseof its greater rarity and in part because it may have played more of a role in statusdisplay than in economic transactions.74 However, the remarkable concentration of goldfinds fromTorksey does seem to suggest the use of gold in such transactions. This may evenhelp to explain the unique discovery of fake hack-gold from the site, in the form of gold-plated copper alloy, including a fragment of an ingot and two sections cut from squarerods.75It is possible that copper-alloy artefacts were also being used as a form of low-valuebullion. Indeed, there are twelve copper-alloy ingots fromTorksey (fig 19), one of which hasthe transverse hammering often visible on silver ingots, and this may hint at a system ofvalue where copper was of some importance in exchange.76 Such a practice is not reflectedin Viking Age hoards in England, but copper-alloy ingots from eastern England areFig 18.

Botharguably reflect the design and weight standards of Arabic copper-alloy weights,and similar examples appear in considerable numbers on Scandinavian sites from the 860sand 870s, while there is some evidence, from Birka and Gotland, that they were beingmanufactured there.80 They are increasingly being recognised from sites in Britainand Ireland: Aldwark has produced twenty-four cubo-octahedral weights, and there is also onefrom Woodstown, although neither has produced a spheroid weight.81 Those at Torkseymust represent parts of multiple sets of weights.

Nearly 250 lead weights have been recovered, thirty-seven of which are inset with decorative metalwork, largely of insular origin. Similar insetlead weights have been found at numerous sites: Aldwark; Woodstown; the settlement atLlanbedrgoch on Anglesey; and in Viking burials at Islandbridge, near Dublin, and atKiloran Bay, in the Inner Hebrides. Inset lead weights are also found in low numbers inScandinavia itself, where they are thought to represent the transfer of an insular Vikingtradition.82These inset weights seem, therefore, to reflect innovation in the operation of themetal-weight economy, and the production of these weights provides another example ofmanufacturing during the earliest phases of Scandinavian settlement.The sheer scale of the precious and base metalwork from Torksey does not, of itself,demonstrate the nature or extent of economic transactions undertaken there, but these arelikely to have been diverse. The distribution of precious metals was undoubtedly one of themeans by which Viking leaders enhanced their prestige and secured the loyalty of theirfollowers. While the imported dirhams show extensive fragmentation, this is not true of theAnglo-Saxon coins, which may reflect their use within a monetary economy, not simply asbullion. The use of bullion alongside amanaged currency has been dubbed the ‘dual economy’of the Danelaw, and has been assigned to the period when coins began to be minted forScandinavian rulers from the 880s/890s until the 920s, but it now appears that it existed fromthe very outset of Viking settlement in the west.83 The picture that emerges from Torksey is,however, not so much of a ‘dual economy’ as of multiple metal economies operating simul-taneously, with gold, silver and copper alloy all used in both coined and bullion form.84It is unlikely that the Great Army accrued the wealth that is reflected in the finds fromTorksey solely through raiding and plunder. The Great Army is repeatedly recorded as havingFig 20. A sample of weights from Torksey, including examples of cubo-octahedral,truncated spheroid and lead inset types.

Irish and continental sources record the captureand sale of slaves by Viking armies, and while this is not directly documented in contemporarysources in England, it must have occurred; indeed, the peace treaty between Alfred andGuthrum from the 880s contains a clause in which the rulers agreed not to harbour therunaway slaves from the other’s realm.86 Slaves may also have been used for labour or toprovide sexual services within the camp. The ransoming of hostages may have been anothermeans of acquiring wealth, and hostages were also politically useful. Following the arrival ofthe Great Army at Repton, the new ruler of Mercia, Ceolwulf, gave hostages and swore oathsthat he would be ready ‘at the enemy’s service’ whenever required. The details of the peacemade between the Army and the Mercians at Torksey are not provided in the Anglo-SaxonChronicle, but it may have included similar arrangements.87Coin productionThere is some tentative evidence that the Great Army was minting coins during itscampaigns. A strip of lead fromTorksey bearing the impression of the die for an imitative goldsolidus of Louis the Pious (814–40) supports the long-held belief that imitative gold solidi werebeingminted in England, since a number have been found in eastern England, albeit not fromthese actual dies.88They seem intended to have served as coins, not pendants, since there is noevidence for suspension loops. A lead impression of a lunette coin of Burgred of Mercia fromTorksey (fig 21) also suggests minting; it appears to bear a blundered inscription, as do 23 percent of the stycas, which may be an indication that these were Viking imitations.89 A platedcopper-alloy lunette was evidently a forgery, and one of the dirhams (finds catalogue CM.601–2010) appears to have a green patina, again suggesting a contemporary forgery, of which asimilar example of the early tenth century has been found in York.90Once they had seized control of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Viking rulers, such asGuthrum, began to mint coins,91 which is usually regarded as requiring ‘an administrativeinfrastructure to issue them and regulate their use’.92However, the lead impressions of diesand blundered stycas from Torksey suggest that the minting of coinage emerged during theoverwintering phase, even before the Viking leaders had adopted the administrative appa-ratus of Anglo-Saxon kingship. Nonetheless, the boundaries between the use of preciousmetals in a bullion, monetary and a status-based or ‘display’ economy can be fluid, andprecious metals could easily be melted down and transformed into other forms, whetheringots, coins or display items, such as the silver arm-rings of which fragments have beenfound at Torksey, along with some evidence for their manufacture.93 The decision to mint85.

The Great Army may have been engaged in minting coins for a variety of reasons:to use coinage in economic exchange locally to buy supplies; to display the aspirations of itsleaders in an attempt to establish Viking authority within the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms; andas a response to competition between leaders within the Great Army.Metal-working and other activitiesMetal was also used in various forms of processing and production. While not capable ofbeing closely dated, melts of gold and silver indicate metal-working, and silver-castingwaste has also been recovered from Aldwark and Woodstown, while a high proportion ofthe cupels and crucibles recovered from Woodstown were used for silver-working.95At Torksey the recovery of three strips of lead on which decorative punches had been testedFig 21.

Indeed, ahoard of iron woodworking tools is believed to have been recovered from the winter camp.99The tools (fig 24), which include four axeheads, an axe hammer, an adze and a two-edged blade,can be dated broadly on typological grounds to the eighth to tenth centuries. If they were usedduring the overwintering it is notable that they have anAnglo-Saxon form, lacking the distinctivepointed lugs of Scandinavian types, and may reveal the use of Anglo-Saxon material culture, ifnot labour.100 Hoards of iron tools have sometimes been interpreted as ritual deposits; in aScandinavian context, these are typically found in riverine and marshy environments.101However, a ritual interpretation seems unlikely for the Torksey hoard as the tools are not acomplete set for any particular type of woodworking, unlike broadly contemporary iron hoardsfrom Scandinavia.102 The worn and damaged tools were accompanied by some fifteenfragments of iron vessel – mainly bowls, and two tripod stands – suggesting that this was scrapiron ready for reworking; the hoard may therefore provide evidence for both woodworking andiron-working on the site. The general paucity of iron artefacts from Torksey must to a largedegree be connected to the under-representation of iron among the reported finds. It is, inFig 24.

Meanwhile, 289 lead gaming piecesserve as a reminder that the Army may have had leisure time on its hands (fig 26).

Indeed, few items related to military activityhave been recovered – merely two iron spearheads, an iron sword hilt and an arrowhead.THE COMPOSITION AND SIZE OF THE VIKING GREAT ARMYThe winter camp at Torksey was evidently occupied not only by warriors, but also bymerchants and craftworkers. Women and children may also have been present, as they arecertainly recorded as accompanying Viking armies in contemporary continental sourcesand in the Chronicle entries for 893 and 895.104 While no oval brooches typical of femaleScandinavian dress have been recovered, and the other items of jewellery and dress acces-sories found cannot be confidently assigned to a specific gender, the textile-workingequipment from Torksey may reflect a female presence.

In the unusually detailed account of the Great Army’s battles with theWest Saxon forces in 871, it is apparent that it was led by at least two kings – Halfdan andBagsecg – and a number of jarls, with the army dividing into two at various stages.Moreover, it was reinforced in this year by what the Chronicle describes as a ‘great summerarmy’.107 The differing burial strategies adopted subsequently at Repton and HeathWood – inhumation and cremation, respectively – have similarly been interpreted asindications of the differing factions within the Great Army, which divided in two after theoverwintering at Repton.108 Stable isotope analysis of three males buried in furnished gravesat Repton reveal that they were from diverse regions within Scandinavia.109Fig 26.

The fieldwalking programme recovered seventy fragments ofdefinite or possible human remains (fig 27); two samples were radiocarbon-dated to the lateninth century.110 Excavation revealed that modern ploughing had disturbed the site down tothe underlying clay derived from the Mercia Mudstone; therefore, it was not possible toconfirm the presence of graves, although further fragments of human remains were recov-ered.111Nonetheless, the excavations were useful in revealing that the geology is different here,Fig 27. Plan showing the location of TORK12 test trench (red) and find-spots ofhand-collected human bone (black triangles)110.

Unfortunately, the human remains wereso fragmentary that a minimum number of only two adults, both probably male, could beconfidently identified, aged 18–25 and 25–35 years, respectively. A fragment of occipital,consistent with the human cranium, shows evidence of two separate blows from a sharpimplement, providing compelling evidence for a violent, and probably fatal, encounter.112A further human cranial fragment was recovered c 200m to the north east, which may indicatea second burial area within the camp, possibly reflecting another warband within the Army.It is possible that the presence of Anglo-Saxon slaves and hostages, and perhaps evenallies acquired during their campaigns, explains some of the Anglo-Saxon dress accessoriesand jewellery recovered from Torksey. These were almost exclusively Anglo-Saxon inorigin, and include 133 copper-alloy strap ends, the majority decorated in the late ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Trewhiddle style (fig 28), as well as hooked tags (fig 29). However,it is also possible that Anglo-Saxon material culture was being acquired and usedby Scandinavians even before permanent settlement. Indeed, a disc brooch of the flatAnglo-Saxon form decorated in the Scandinavian Borre style may suggest the presence ofFig 28. Examples of Anglo-Saxon strap ends from Torksey.

Although not all of the 55ha is likely to have been asdensely occupied as a later town – and it may have comprised separate zones for the distinctgroups that made up the Army, for industrial and trading activities and for living spaceand burial – the clear implication is that the population of the camp numbered in thethousands, not the hundreds. The Repton camp now seems rather small at 0.4ha to haveaccommodated an army and its accompanying camp followers, and it appears implausiblysmall in the context of the camp at Torksey. The Torksey camp is also considerablylarger thanWoodstown at 2.91ha and is more comparable with the winter camp at Aldwark,which is estimated to extend over 31ha; although smaller, this may reflect the fact thatAldwark dates to a few years later, after the Great Army had divided in two.114 The scale ofTorksey is striking given that it has been estimated that the four major urban places inScandinavia – Birka at c 6ha; Kaupang at c 5.4ha; Ribe (Denmark) at c 12ha; and Hedeby(Germany) at c 24ha – were all considerably smaller, even at their maximum extent in thetenth century.115Without doubt, given the size of the camp, the Great Army and its followers, probablyincluding women and children as well as traders and craftworkers, comprised thousands ofpeople. We can never know exact numbers, but if a fleet comprised 50–100 longships, andFig 29. Examples of Anglo-Saxon hooked tags from Torksey. Photograph:© Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge113.

TheAnglo-Saxon Chronicle references to fleets of several hundred ships may not have beenexaggerations after all.WHY TORKSEY?The choice of Torksey was doubtless partly determined by its easily defendable position at ajunction of river and road routes. However, it was not the only option facing theGreat Army, asthere are other suitable locations along this stretch of the Trent, including a similar ‘island’ 4kmsouth atKettlethorpe.116 It is difficult to assess the specific appeal of Torksey, given that we havenowritten record pre-dating theChronicle entry and little archaeological evidence that is reliablyearlier. David Stocker has proposed that there was an Anglo-Saxon ‘beach market’ associatedwith St Margaret’s Church at Marton just to the north of the camp. However, the basis for thisargument is Sawyer’s suggestion that the metalwork from what is now known to be the site ofthe winter camp derived from a market of eighth- and ninth-century date, and the presence ofmultiple stone sculptures of the second quarter of the tenth century at StMargaret’s.117There isnothing to indicate significant activity prior to 872–3, even following our fieldwalking on the siteof the winter camp and in the fields to the south of the village. Only a single sherd of handmadeearly Anglo-Saxon pottery has been recovered during excavation in the village, while sherds oftwo sixth-century vessels recorded by J N L Myres are from unknown find-spots within theparish.118 Two sixth-century brooches have been recovered by metal detectorists east of thevillage.119 Excavation in the 1960s of one of the pottery kilns to the south of the village – whichhas since been dated to the late ninth century – revealed traces of an earlier building comprisingstone foundations laid in clay, but nothing else is known of the building.120The early history of Torksey is obscure. It was held by Queen Edith in 1066, but wecannot discern how long it had been a royal landholding.121 There is some intriguingevidence that the parish churches of St Peter and St Mary were part of an early ecclesiasticalcomplex, principally in the form of their juxtaposition, and the pairing of their dedications,which has been found at early monastic complexes. However, they have produced no earlystructural evidence and our radiocarbon dating of cist graves associated with the church ofSt Mary has produced only eleventh-century dates. Within and around the modern villageof Torksey, three further cemeteries have been excavated that date broadly to the laterAnglo-Saxon centuries (fig 30), but neither radiocarbon dating nor stratigraphic evidencedates these any earlier than the tenth century.122The Great Army repeatedly spent the winter adjacent to major centres, such as Reptonwhere there was an important Mercian ecclesiastical site and royal shrine.123 It has recentlybeen argued that longphuirt in Ireland were typically located at the boundaries between king-doms, where Viking armies can be found intervening in internecine rivalries.124 However,116.

Nonetheless, there are several major churches in the vicinity. Stow, just4km north east, was an episcopal possession in the eleventh century. Given the interest shownin it by the archbishops of York and the bishops of Dorchester, it has been suggested that thechurch was an endowment of the revived bishopric of Lindsey from the 950s. The cruciformchurch has a large central tower built in the mid-eleventh century under archiepiscopalFig 30.

Food and other resources may have been offered as part ofthe peace settlements made when the Army overwintered, such as those recorded in Frankiain the 860s.128 The Army was also able to exploit natural resources, as demonstrated by therecovery of fishing weights.129 It would have required access to a variety of raw materials,including timber and canvas for the construction of temporary winter accommodation, aswell as for fuel and ship repair, and clay for the manufacture of moulds and hearthsnecessary for metal-casting and smithying. These resources may have been acquired by acombination of foraging, of the type Asser says occurred during the overwintering atReading on the Thames in 870–1, and purchase, which is what some of the coinage andbullion may have facilitated.130 Indeed, one of the largest assemblages of stycas outsideNorthumbria, other than Torksey itself, comes from Littleborough. The date profile of thetwenty-five stycas is almost identical to that of the Torksey assemblage, and may indicatecontemporaneous activity.131 Clearly, the army must have reached some form of accom-modation with the local population, albeit enforced. The winter camps, like the towns thatsucceeded them, must have had hinterlands that extended for several kilometres. Indeed,the association between the camp at Repton with the Viking cemetery at HeathWood, some4km to the south east, underlines the need to consider the camps at a landscape level, not assingle sites.132 No doubt the sudden arrival of a settlement the size of a small town had amajor impact on the locality.133WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?The Great Army did not merely spend a few months in a locale and then moveon; its leaders often attempted to maintain some level of control. Sometimes, theyappointed a ruler from the local elite, as demonstrated at Repton where they replacedBurgred with Ceolwulf II, while the Anglo-Saxon successors of Edmund of East Anglia(d. 869) minted coins that, in the words of Blackburn, displayed ‘all the hallmarksof a Viking coinage’, suggesting they were ‘puppet kings’.134 Beyond the fact that the125.

However, Torksey is well known for itswheel-thrown pottery industry, which developed in the wake of the overwintering.Torksey ware has not been recovered from excavated contexts reliably pre-dating theend of the ninth century in York or Lincoln, and none was recovered from the wintercamp during our fieldwalking. Torksey was at the forefront of a revolution in ceramicproduction, which witnessed the reintroduction of the fast potter’s wheel for thefirst time since the Roman period, and the use of updraft kilns producing high-firedsand-tempered vessels on a near industrial scale. The involvement of Carolingianpotters has long been suspected, given that the fast wheel had remained in use on thecontinent.135Torksey ware has been found widely in eastern and northern England. It has previouslybeen suggested that ‘Torksey-type’ ware was also produced in York, following thepresumed foundation of a ‘daughter industry’ of Torksey, but fabric analysis conducted aspart of the present project has revealed that this pottery was, in fact, produced in Torkseyand transported north.136 The arrival of Carolingian potters was part of the legacy of theoverwintering of the Great Army, and our project has revealed the pottery industry atTorksey was of regional significance, and must have been crucial to the emergence of athriving urban settlement with 213 burgesses by 1066.137 By the turn of the eleventh centuryTorksey possessed a mint, and by the twelfth century a court.138 It has accordingly beensuggested that Torksey was one of the ‘seven boroughs’ referred to within the Anglo-SaxonChronicle entry for 1015, thought to have included the ‘five boroughs’ of Derby,Lincoln, Nottingham, Stamford and Leicester named in the Chronicle entry for 942, alongwith two others.139 There were at least three parish churches and two monasteries inTorksey by the twelfth century, serving as another marker of its urban growth in thecenturies following the Viking overwintering.140CONCLUSIONSIn summary, our research at Torksey has revealed not only the location of the Viking wintercamp, but something of its character as well. The sheer quantity and value of the metalworkassemblage forces a radical reappraisal of the scale of wealth amassed by the Viking GreatArmy. Plunder was being processed on a massive scale. There was intensive trade andexchange in goods and probably in slaves. The evidence from Torksey suggests a hybrideconomy with monetary as well as bullion transactions and the minting of coins, reflectingsomething of the complexity of the multiple economic systems that co-existed during theViking Age.141Torksey also forces us to reassess our interpretation of the size of the winter camps, andof the Great Army that occupied them. Hitherto, our picture of Viking encampments haslargely been derived from the excavations at Repton, but it is now clear that even if theD-shaped enclosure was, indeed, the work of the Great Army it can only reflect a small part135.

It is apparent that much antiquarian, and even some modern,speculation about the potential locations of Viking winter camps is misguided; researchershave been seeking sites that are far too small and have been lured into an unnecessary searchfor D-shaped enclosures.142 The unusual concentration of people in such camps has beenrevealed by our work at Torksey, and they may have given many of the members of theViking armies their first taste for urban living.143 Other urban features included a range ofindustries, comprising the processing of precious metals and other metal-working,smithying and textile-working. Although pottery manufacture was not undertaken on thecamp, the development of the Torksey ware industry followed soon after the Army depar-ted, and was a direct result of its overwintering, following the arrival of Carolingian potterswho introduced the technology.144Our research at Torksey has demonstrated the huge importance of the winter camp andits legacy as well as its role for our understanding of the Viking Great Army and thedevelopment of urban life in ninth-century England. Indeed, there is already more evidencefor ninth-century activity from Torksey than from the ‘five boroughs’ combined. Futurefieldwork may well reveal more about the nature of camp life, including temporary livingstructures, industrial hearths and faunal assemblages, and the processes by which the townof Torksey developed.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe Anglo-Saxon and Viking Torksey project is a collaboration between the Universities ofSheffield and York, with the additional participation of staff of the Portable AntiquitiesScheme and York Museums Trust.
