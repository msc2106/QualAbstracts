ABSTRACT: 
Following the 2011 wave of political unrest, extending from the Arab Spring to the UK riots, the formation of a large consensus around Internet censorship is underway. The present paper adopts a social simulation approach to show that the decision to ‚Äúregulate‚Äù, filter or censor social media in situations of unrest changes the pattern of civil protest and ultimately results in higher levels of violence. Building on Epstein's (2002) agent-based model, several alternative scenarios are generated. The systemic optimum, represented by complete absence of censorship, not only corresponds to lower levels of violence over time, but allows for significant periods of social peace after each outburst.

In a (regrettably not infrequent) display of duplicity, the same information technologies that had been presented as tools of liberation in the height of the Arab Spring, have been portrayed as threats to the very values of freedom and peace that Western governments allegedly stand for. So the question of why social media would bring democracy to developing countries and anarchy to Western ones remains open. Some analysts interpret this contradiction as a strategy which, by creating a climate of moral panic surrounding popular culture, distracts from, and smoothes away, the societal issues underlying the uprisings (Fuchs, 2011).

One of these factors is the use of social media to organize flash mobs and to build field awareness in urban uprising settings.

The model takes into account other factors that might mitigate civil violence, such as government legitimacy and the perceived risk of being arrested.

Taking his contribution as a starting point, we have developed a new version of the model,10 also programmed in Netlogo, to evaluate the tactical use of social media to create flash mobs deployed in a situation of civil violence. Our innovation with respect to the original model is twofold. Firstly, we have UHLQWHUSUHWHG¬≥YLVLRQ¬¥LQWHUPVRIFHQVRUVKLS¬± with high levels of vision corresponding to low censorship, and vice versa. Secondly, and more importantly, we have modified 9 In this paper, tactical use of social media designates the adoption of informal and ad-hoc practices of electronic communication (mainly geolocative media, social networking, texting, and real-time computer conferencing) for the purpose of temporary political confrontation. Our definition stems from Garcia and Lovink (1997). 10 The Netlogo file, the simulation code, and an html version of our model is available online at http://www.bodyspacesociety.eu/uk-riots/. 6 WKH FRQVHTXHQFHV RI ¬≥YLVLRQ¬¥ ,Q WKH RUiginal simulation, agents and police officers move to randomly chosen places within their vision range. Conversely, in our model a different rule has been introduced to make agents move to places in their vision range that are surrounded by the maximum number of active protesters.11 This simple change simulates the behaviour of individuals involved in civil unrest, using BBM or Twitter to detect, and to converge in, hot spots. The result of the modified model is thus consistent with the tactical use of mobile technologies by protesters to gain a situational advantage over police forces and have a better awareness of the field, its resources and possible weak spots. If the value of vision is higher (as in a situation where online networking tools are widespread and not censored), each agent has fairly complete information as to what is going on even in remote locations. If social communication is censored, the value of vision is lower, and agents have partial or non-existent awareness of their surroundings and tend to move randomly. Internet Censorship - A Source of Protracted High-level Violence Our social simulation code reproduces the functioning of a social system (presumably an urban setting, such as a city or a borough) over a relatively long period of time (in practice and for modelling purposes, 1,000 time steps),12 for different values of the parameter vision caeteris paribus (see Table 2 in the Appendix). Graphically, the Netlogo implementation of the model represents social agents as green circles, all the more dark as their levels of grievance are high. Active protesters turn red and jailed protesters black; police officers appear as blue triangles (Figure 2). [INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE] Figure 2. A hypothetical social system, as can be represented graphically in the model, at time 0 (left panel) and after some time steps (central and right panels).

The empirical interpretation of time steps (whether they would represent hours, days, or months) is not attempted here as it would require appropriate time series data. 7 [INSERT FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE] Figure 3. Red patterns represent number of violent protesters over time with different levels of social media censorship Legend: Levels from 0 vision (total censorship, upper left) to 10 vision (no censorship, lower right). 6RXUFHDXWKRUV¬∂HODERUDWLRQ Different patterns of civil unrest over time are generated by different values of vision. All scenarios display an initial outburst, but the subsequent evolution of the overall number of agents engaged in active violent behaviour (red line) is influenced by the level of censorship government applies on social media. In the case of total censorship (vision = 0), the level of violence stays at its maximum virtually forever (a scenario reminiscent of the Egyptian situation, where an escalation of protests followed the decision to block Internet access). The other cases correspond to less and less censorship. Values between 1 (almost complete censorship) and 9 (almost no censorship) correspond to different levels of protracted civil unrest: the stronger the censorship, the higher the average level of endemic violence over time (best linear fit represented by the black lines in Figure 3). The last case, corresponding to highest vision (and thus virtually no censorship) deserves further comment. Apparently this situation is characterised by incessant high- level outbursts of violence, with peak active levels that seem to be even more sizeable than in other cases. Yet, the average level of violence over time (black fitting trend line) remains among the lowest. Moreover, if we want to measure the magnitude of violent outbursts, their peak active level is not an appropriate measure.

In the absence of censorship, agents protest, sometimes violently, nevertheless they are able to return to significant levels of calm (green line in Figure 4), when social unrest is halted.

[INSERT FIGURE 6 ABOUT HERE] Figure 6. Average number of active (red), calm (green) and jailed (black) agents as function of levels of censorship Legend: Higher vision means less censorship and implies less civil violence. The total number of agents LVFRQVWDQWDFURVVDOOVLPXODWLRQVDQGRYHUWLPH6RXUFHDXWKRUV¬∂HODERUDWLRQ Recall that one feature of the model is the presence of police officers, who can arrest protesters and keep them in jail for some time; one might therefore ask whether lower levels of violence correspond simply to having many agents in jail, so that unrest might restart as soon as they get out.13 Figure 6 above shows that this is not the case: while the average number of jailed agents increases with vision up to a certain point (about 7- 8), it then decreases again; and the number of agents that do not participate in protest remains stable up to about the same level of vision (of 7-8), then slightly increases. This result shows that the lower levels of civil violence that are observed under conditions of highest vision (and, equivalently, least censorship) are due to the choice of agents themselves to remain calm, not to repression by the police forces. Based on these remarks, another important point can be clarified. Arguably, the level of civil violence is only slightly lower with maximum vision (9 or 10 in the model, corresponding to total absence of censorship), than with a vision of about 7-8 (corresponding to some moderate degree of censorship). Yet peaks of violence are 13 The authors thank Mario Paolucci for raising this issue in a comment to the preliminary version of this paper, published as a blog post, and starting a discussion on the effects of policing and arrests (see http://www.bodyspacesociety.eu/2011/08/11/is-a-social-media-fuelled-uprising-the-worst-case-scenario-elements- for-a-sociology-of-uk-riots/). 9 sharper when vision is 10 than when it is just 7-8. Therefore, one interpretation might be that a moderate degree of censorship is preferable to no censorship at all, in that it produces a fairly similar average level of violence, but with more stability. 14 Figure 6, however, shows that the level of stability in the moderate censorship scenario is achieved at the price of having a larger proportion of the population in prison. Indeed the average number of jailed agents reaches a maximum precisely when vision is 7. Instead, the low average violence that is produced in a no-censorship system (vision of 10) derives largely from endogenous processes that lead society members themselves to choose to be calm ¬± and in this sense is better. Progressive Changes in Levels of Censorship Validate Previous Results So far, we have assumed that the value of the parameteU¬≥YLVLRQ¬¥¬± and thus, the degree of censorship ¬± remains constant during a single simulation run. The question that arises is to what extent our results differ if, starting from an initial situation in which access to social media is unrestricted (vision = 10), the government decides to exert censorship, whether partial (vision between 1 and 9) or total (vision = 0).

The former correspond to government measures that become enforceable at pre-defined times, independently of the state of the system at those times; the latter exemplify cases in which the government partially and progressively restricts access to online communications whenever it feels threatened by a high number of protesters.15 Figure 7 presents results obtained with an exogenous change in levels of vision, in a simulation run of 1,000 time steps. Vision changes from 10 (no censorship) to 5 (moderate censorship) after 200 time steps, and goes down to 0 (full censorship) after another 600 steps. The system first reproduces the pattern observed in Figure 3 above for a (constant) level of vision of 10; when vision becomes 5, it shifts very rapidly to the pattern that corresponds to this level of vision, portrayed in Figure 3; and after vision drops to 0, it moves to the pattern that Figure 3 shows to be characteristic of this level of vision. Interestingly, these patterns could be entirely predicted based on our first simulation of scenarios with constant values of vision over time, as represented in Figure 3. These results are fairly general in that qualitatively similar systemic behaviours are obtained with different combinations of values of vision and number of steps after which a change occurs; that is, moving from a level of 10 to 2 (instead of 5) 14 We thank Juliette Rouchier and Sara Gorgoni for drawing our attention to this point, respectively in an e-mail exchange and during the Center for Business Network Analysis seminar, University of Greenwich. 15 Because the British government did not ultimately exert any explicit censorship of telecommunication networks in August 2011, these are theoretical scenarios and the specific values of parameters that we use must be taken as hypothetical only. 10 to 0. Hence, it can be concluded that the above analysis is also helpful to assess the effects of exogenous changes in vision. [INSERT FIGURE 7 ABOUT HERE] Figure 7. Number of calm, jailed and active agents when vision decreases from 10 to 5 after 200 steps, and then to 0 after another 600 steps Legend: In each case, the system reproduces the pattern that is observed when vision is constant at the level considered, and that can be predicted based on Figure 3 above; after a change, it switches very rapidly from one pattern to the other. To study the effects of endogenous changes in vision in simulation runs of 1000 time steps each, we implement the rule that whenever the number of active agents exceeds a certain percentage of the total number of agents, vision declines by one point. Thresholds of 45 percent and above are never reached, and vision remains de facto constant at 10 all the time: the no-censorship solution is obtained. In all other cases, the system adjusts very rapidly to a state in which the level of vision stabilizes at some value below 10, and the numbers of active, jailed and calm agents reflect the same outcomes that are obtained when the corresponding level of vision is constant at that value (as illustrated in Figure 3 above). In particular, when the critical threshold is between 15 percent and 45 percent, vision reaches equilibrium at some intermediate value (between 3 and 9), corresponding to moderate censorship; if the threshold is 15 percent or lower, vision stabilizes at 0 (full censorship), and the system exhibits a pattern that closely resembles the upper-left panel of Figure 3. We illustrate these three cases in Figure 8, with specific thresholds of, respectively, 30 percent, 10 percent and 50 percent. Again the conclusion is that, aIWHU VRPH LQLWLDO DGMXVWPHQW WKH V\VWHP¬∂V outcomes are consistent with the explanations outlined in the previous sections of this article.

In all cases, the system rapidly stabilizes for a level of vision that remains constant over time, and reproduces the pattern observed when vision is constant at that level. Possible equilibrium levels of vision are 10 (for thresholds of 45 percent and above), 0 (for thresholds of 15 percent and below), or intermediate values (for all other thresholds).

Our paper attempts to respond to a social demand for clarification in a phase still dominated by conflicting discourses as to the possible causes and legitimate reactions to the 2011 outbursts of civil violence. The research directions gradually emerging are forking between the ones focussing on micro-motives (such as personality, culture, morals) and the ones relying on macro-indicators (such as poverty and social stratification) as explanatory factors. The computational method adopted here aims to bridge this divergence by showing how a set of rules operating at a micro level can account for collective dynamics. An approach detecting macro-structures starting from micro-interactions is subject to limitations (limitations of which we are aware of) and may not always be suitable for social research.16 Nevertheless along with Banos (2010), we consider agent-EDVHG VLPXODWLRQV DV ¬≥FUXWFKHV¬¥ IRU WKHRU\ EXLOGLQJ DOO WKH PRUH XVHIXO ZKHQ adopting a stance consistent with established sociology.

So, we desperately need methodology to keep us erect, while we navigate a terrain that moves and shifts even as we attempt to traverse it. Of course, studying computer-mediated communication via the civil violence model inspired by Epstein does not prevent other factors from coming into play. As shown in a recent paper by Klemens et al. (2010), rebellious outbursts are more likely given increased hardship (the recent financial crisis does seem to come into play here). Civil violence is also influenced by loss of government legitimacy ¬± which in this case seems consistent with the unpopular budget cuts promoted by David Cameron, not to mention the 2011 News Corporation phone hacking and corruption scandal. Finally, protest outbursts are less likely when the competitive advantage of activists is reduced.

Garlick and Chli (2009), for example, insist that restricting social communication pacifies rebellious societies, but has the opposite effect on peaceful ones. Our intention has been to show that, in the absence of robust indicators as to the rebelliousness of a given society, the choice of not restricting social communication turns out to be a judicious one for avoiding to trade democratic values and freedom of expression for an illusory sense of security. 17 See http://www.facebook.com/pages/Supporting-the-Met-Police-against-the-London-rioters/152937041453243? sk=wall. 18 See http://www.flickr.com/photos/metropolitanpolice/sets/72157627267892973/. 19 See http://groups.google.com/group/london-riots-facial-recognition. 13 Appendix Table 1.

In each case, the system reproduces the pattern observed when vision is constant at the level considered, and that can be predicted based on Figure 3 above; after a change, it switches very rapidly from one pattern to the other. 23 Figure 8: Number of quiet, jailed and active agents (left panels) and levels of vision (right panels) when vision starts from 10 and declines by one point whenever the proportion of active agents over the whole population reaches a critical threshold ¬±here, 30% (upper panels), 10% (middle panels) and 50% (lower panels). In all cases, the system rapidly stabilizes at a level of vision that remains constant over time, and then reproduces the pattern observed when vision is constant at that level. Possible equilibrium levels of vision are 10 (for thresholds of 45% and above), 0 (for thresholds of 15% and below), or intermediate values (for all other thresholds).
