ABSTRACT: 
The relationship between scattering data obtained from ultrasonic experiments, in which the waves are excited and detected in a finite measurement geometry, and unbounded medium, farfield scattering amplitudes is considered. For a scatterer in a single fluid medium, a Green’s function approach is used to develop an approximate, but absolute, relationship between these experimental and theoretical cases. Electromechanical reciprocity relationships are then employed to generalize to a two medium case in which the scatterer is located in an elastic solid which, along with the ultrasonic transducer, is immersed in a fluid medium. The case explicitly considered is one in which the incident waves are quasiplanar over the volume of the flaw and the scattering amplitudes are slowly varying over the range of angles subtended by the receiving transducer. Analytic approximations are developed for the absolute relationship of the received transducer signal to the unbounded medium scattering amplitudes, and formal expressions for the error terms are presented. Preliminary experimental confirmation is reported for the cases of (1) L→L and T→T pulse–echo scattering from oblate spheroidal voids and (2) both pulse–echo and pitch–catch L→L scattering from spherical inclusions. With no adjustable parameters, good agreement for both the phase and absolute amplitude response is observed.

However, measurements of scattering are always made with transducers offinite aper- ture, at finite distances from the scatterer. Furthermore, the transducer is often immersed in a fluid medium and the wave has passed through the liquid-solid interface twice during the measurement. In principle, complete theoretical scatter- ing solutions can be developed for this more complex scatter- ing situation. However, even the introduction of the liquid- solid interface significantly complicates the elastic wave scattering ]'2 and further introduction of finite beam ef- fects 3-5 in an exact manner would generally lead to computa- tional complexity which would severely restrict he use of the results in the routine interpretation of experiments. An alternative point of view would be to view the unbounded medium scattering amplitude A as a canonical solution and to develop approximate expressions which relate this to the solutions for the more complex measurement geometries. This point of view is routinely adopted in studies of the acoustic scattering (e.g., sonar) from various obstacles. 6-9 In that case, the problem is greatly simplified by the facts that (a) the fluid medium only supports a single wave type, (b) the waves do not pass through a refracting and mode converting interface, and (c) calibration experiments can be performed with arbitrary relative positions of transducers and reflect- ing surfaces to eliminate diffraction effects. The purpose of the present paper is to treat the extension of these ideas to measurements of elastic wave scattering made through a liq- uid-solid interface. Included is the derivation of an absolute measurement model relating the observed signals to scatter- ing amplitudes for the case of small flaws, the formal discus- sion of error terms, and the presentation of the results of experimental tests which support he validity of the model. A number of scattering models have appeared in the literature which incorporate the effects of finite measure- ment geometries. In one of the first attempts to use absolute amplitude information in interpreting ultrasonic scattering information, Krautkramer made use of scalar Kirchhoff dif- fraction theory to predict the signal which would be ob- served at an ultrasonic transducer when the beam is reflected from a completely reflecting disk on the axis of and normal to the beam. ]ø Although originally derived for a pulse-echo inspection with a circular beam, this result has been ex- FIG. 1.

Kirchhoff dif- fraction theory has also been used to model measurements for more complex flaw and beam geometries. Haines and Langston 16 have treated the farfield reflection of pulses from irregular flaws, small with respect o the beamwidth, by ex- tending a scalar diffraction theory which was originally de- veloped for the acoustic ase. 17'•s In a series of unpublished reports pertaining to the detection of cracks in pressure ves- sel welds in nuclear power plants, •9-2• they have extended their work to the case of planar flaws whose sizes are com- parable to, or greater than, the beam dimensions. In the same context, an elastodynamic Kirchhoff treatment of the scat- tering from an elliptical crack, possibly large with respect o the beam size, has been developed by Chapman. 22 Other scattering theories have also been incorporated in models of the measurement process. Quasistatic scattering solutions have recently been used to establish a direct rela- tionship between absolute scattering measurements in the Rayleigh regime and failure related parameters of elliptical cracks in elastic solids. 23 To aid in the practical application of these and related techniques, elastic wave reciprocity rela- tions have been developed by Kino 24 and Auld 25 and used to interpret he signals measured in finite geometries for specif- ic cases. 22'26'27 The purpose of the present paper is to develop a general model which can be applied to scattering measurements made through a liquid-solid interface. The reciprocity for- malism is used to derive an approximate but absolute xpres- sion relating the ultrasonic signals to the scattering ampli- tudes defined in Fig. 1. Since these scattering amplitudes can be obtained using any available theoretical technique, the model has considerable generality and provides a direct link between theory and commonly occurring experimental con- figurations. Potential applications of the resulting measure- ment model include the correction of systematic measure- ment errors in inverse scattering experiments 2 and in computing the probability of detecting various flaws in ul- 29 31 trasonic nondestructive evaluation. - I. DERIVATION OF MEASUREMENT MODEL A. Explicit derivation for a single medium For conceptual purposes, consider first the case in which the scattering object is in the same fluid medium as the transducer so that no interface transmission is involved. The geometry is shown in Fig. 2. Assume that the circular trans- ducer acts as a piston source of radius "a," i.e., all points on its face move with equal displacement. It is well known 32 that the pressure p and velocity/1 of the radiated fields are given by the expression /1 = V•b, (1) P = --Po•, (2) where Po is the fluid density and •b is the scalar potential given by the Rayleigh diffraction integral - •d2A. (3) 4 2•r s transducer face Here Vo is the velocity of the piston source, ko is the wave vector, and s is the distance from a point on the transducer face to the observation point. The integrand in Eq. (3) is the Green's function for this problem. Throughout the paper, the assumed time harmonic dependence e •'ø' will be omitted. If the flaw is on the axis of the radiated beam and is sufficiently small and/or sufficiently far from the trans- ducer, the wave fronts are nearly planar over the flaw sur- face. In this "quasiplane-wave" assumption, the incident field is thus replaced by a olane wave of amplitude h,,• VoC (z}e -•'• (4} where C (z) (J2---•)e •køz f f -•køs = _ d2A. $ (5) transducer face z is the distance from the center of the transducer to the flaw. C (z), as defined in Eq.'15 ), is exactly equal to the pressure at point z, divided by the pressure, povoVo e-j•, that would have been radiated had the transducer had infinite extent. It is thus a measure of the diffraction induced deviations from the initial plane-wave condition. Equation (4) is an approxi- mation because the velocity and pressure are not strictly pro- portional [see Eqs. (1) and (2)], but the error is small under "quasiplane-wave" conditions. When these fields illuminate the flaw, the farfield scat- tering is described by a scattering amplitude A hs = [A (a, t3 )h,/r]e-/•ø•, (6) where (r,a, t3 ) are the components of the position vector in a spherical coordinate system whose origin is at the flaw cen- troid and whose z axis coincides with the direction of illumi- nation. hs is the velocity of the radiated field which is polar- ized in the direction •. This scattered field will illuminate and be detected by the receiving transducer shown in Fig. 2{b}. Here it is as- sumed that the detected voltage is proportional to the spatial average of the pressure that would have existed over the area of its face had the transducer not been present. This assump- tion has proved successful in related problems. 33 As a further heuristic justification, note that for the common case of a backed piezoelectric receiver, the high mechanical imped- ance of the piezoelectric transducer with respect o that of water implies that, to first order, the transducer acts as a rigid boundary. For plane waves at near normal incidence, the pressure at a rigid boundary is essentially twice that of the incident field that exists in the absence of the transducer. The assumption that the response is proportional to the spa- tial average of the unperturbed pressure is thus appropriate for this case. Deviations from this assumption are often ac- counted for by a correction factor known as the "diffraction constant" of a transducer. 34'35 Under these conditions, the received voltage F is ob- tained by combining Eq. {6} and the quasiplane-wave ap- 1280 J.

The generalization to a two-transducer, pitch-catch measurement is obvious. B. Reciprocity derivation for two medium case The derivation of Eq. (8) ultimately rests on the explicit definition ofthe fluid medium Green's function {e-•)/s {Ref. 32). The generalization to the two medium case could be based on the definition of a second Green's function ap- propriate to that geometry. Howeyer, because of the com- plexity of the Green's function required to treat propagation through fluid-elastic solid interfaces, the explicit use of such a function will be avoided here. Instead, the derivation will be based on reciprocity relations which provide a convenient formalism in which the generalization of Eq. {8) can be de- rived. Kino :4 and Auld •5 have recently derived and presented illustrative applications of reciprocity relations for elastic wave scattering problems. Chapman has further applied this to the case of scattering from smooth flat cracks.:: In that work, the crack is described by the elastodynami½ Kirchhoff theory 36 and may have a size large with respect to the beam profile of the transducers. These profiles are included in his calculation by using approximate expressions for the case of angle shear interrogation with a contact, wedge transducer. In the present work, the electromechanical reciprocity rela- tions :s have been applied to the generalization ofthe prob- lem discussed in Sec. I. The results are placed in a formula- tion in which any model for unbounded medium scattering amplitudes can be used, and analytical results are obtained for the small flaw and/or farfield case discussed previously. Figure 3 presents the geometry of the calculation. It is assumed that two transducers (identical in structure) are placed in the fluid and used in a pitch-catch {pulse-echo is a special case) measurement of the scattering from the flaw. The waves pass through the liquid-solid interface, which can have arbitrary shape, during both the illumination and reception processes. Let F be defined as the ratio of the elec- trical power radiated into coaxial line "b" by the receiving transducer to the electrical power incident on the illuminat- ing transducer from coaxial line "a." Then the reciprocity relation states that the change 6FF induced by the presence of the flaw is given by 1 fs,• (fia 'To --rio' Ta )-h d2.,• (9) where fia and Ta are the velocity and stress fields which would be produced in the presence of the flaw, when trans- ducer "a" is excited by an electrical power P, rio, and To are the fields which would be produced, in the absence of the flaw, when transducer "b" is excited by an electrical power P, $F is an arbitrary closed surface containing the flaw, and h is an inward directed normal to that surface. To develop a generalization of Eq. {8), equivalent ap- proximations will be introduced for 'these fields. The fields when the flaw is illuminated by transducer "a" will be writ- ten as 1281 J.

These fields are sketched in Fig. 3(a). The "quasiplane-wave" assumption is equivalent to requiring the error terms (,•/ii/•/'a) and {A Ti/Pio a •a) to be much less than unity over the surface $•.

Fields arising from reverbera- tion between the flaw and the surface are not explicitly in- eluded in Eqs. (15)and (16)and may be thought to be part of the error term. For the small flaws of primary interest here, their contributions are often insignificant. •'•'•? The final set of fields required to evaluate Eq. {9) are those that would be produced when transducer "b "is used to generate the waves and the flaw is absent.

(20) The "•" over the scattering amplitude in Eq. (19) denotes the (unusual) convention that angles are measured with re- spect to the central ray of solution "b" instead of the direc- tion of illumination, and the "(,)" notation in Eq. (20)repre- sents error terms which arise when the indicated velocity fields, and associated stresses, are substituted into Eq. (9). Note that (A fi•,fib ) vanishes identically because of the defin- ition of 6FF as a flaw induced change in scattered signal. Hence, these terms do not appear in Eq. (20). Equation (19) is an integral over the spherical surface S• of the product of three factors--the scattering amplitude, a phase overlap of solution "b" (characteristic of the receiver) and the scattered field solution "s," and a third factor involv- ing inner products of the displacements and stresses of solu- tions "b" and "s." Note that kb, •,•, and are constants whereas ks, •'s, and ts are functions of 0 and •b. The phase term is most slowly varying when 0 = 0 or 180 ø and the third factor vanishes in the former case. This suggests that the major contribution to the integral will involve As(180 ø) as would be expected on the basis of ray arguments. However, since sin 0 vanishes at 0 = 0 ø, some care must be taken in applying the above reasoning. The following discussion, leading ultimately to the operational Eqs. (26)-(28), treat the evaluation of Eq. (19)in greater detail. For cases of practical interest, ransducer "b "will have been positioned tocouple to either longitudinal or transverse waves at the flaw position. In principle, a transducer posi- tioned to detect longitudinal waves might detect a small amount of shear scattering, and vice versa. However, these contributions will be quite small because of near orthogona- lity of the vectors involved in the aforementioned third fac- tor of Eq. (19). Furthermore, inmany experiments, ime gat- ing eliminates the contributions of the unexpected mode. Hence, it will be assumed that solutions "b" and "s" are for the same mode. Table I summarizes various quantities in- volved in the evaluation of Eq. (19) for the longitudinal and shear wave cases. Here •x, •y, and • are unit vectors in the Cartesian coordinate system shown in Fig. 3(d) and •R, •o, • are unit vectors in the spherical coordinate system. They are related by the usual transformations. The scattered shear wave polarization has been selected such that the inner pro- duct in the third factor of Eq. (19) vanishes for the orthogo- nal polarization. Hence, the selected polarization isthe one which would be detected by transducer "b." The scattering amplitude must refer to this polarization.

The "plane of the sur- face" is defined to be the plane tangent o the real surface at the point of entrance of the central ray of the beam. The effects of curvature of real surfaces enter the model through the parameter Ct, as will be discussed in Sec. ID. Also, ao and at are the ultrasonic attenuation per unit length for lon- gitudinal waves in the fluid and for waves of polarization "1" in the solid, respectively.

(28) Equation (28) is the generalization of Eq. (8) to the two medium problem. It states the general form of the relation- ship between scattering measurements and unbounded me- dium scattering amplitudes for a smoothly curved interface. It does not depend upon explicit knowledge of the appropri- ate Green's function in its derivation, but of course such knowledge must be utilized when evaluating the factors Ca and Co. The difference between the two medium problem and the single medium problem, which have been identified through the use of the reciprocity theorem are (a) the relative contributions of the propagation distances and material properties in the two media, (b) the effects of attenuation, and (c) a formal identification of error terms. Note in parti- cular that the wave vector in the solid, rather than the fluid, appears in the denominator of the expression i brackets. In addition, there is a slight difference in normalization between Eqs. (8) and (28). Whereas y is the ratio of volts received to average unperturbed pressure over the face of the transducer,/• is a measure of efficiency. [The numerator of Eq. (26) is the power density that would be carried by a plane wave of velocity Vo multiplied by the area of the transducer.] Evaluation of the error terms in Eq. (28) can only be done for specific cases. However, some general comments can be made. Note first that El, as given by Eq. (20), consists of three terms. The third will be neglected in this discussion since it involves the product of two error fields and thus is of higher order. The first two will be denoted Els and Elb, respectively, with the second subscript corresponding to the fields whose contribution to the error is being evaluated. As R increases, one expects the relative contributions of Els, Elb, and E2 to respectively decrease (approaching closer to farfield), increase (breakdown of quasiplane-wave assump- tion), and decrease [because of R in denominator of Eq. (25)]. However, their sum must remain a constant since the lead- ing, approximate term in Eq. (28) is independent of R, as is 6Ft. To develop insight into the conditions when the total error is small, consider the application of Eq. (24) to a single medium problem. For a piston source operatin• in the far- field, the quasiplane-wave illumination assumption will hold when the integration sphere radius R is small with respect o the width of the central lobe of the radiation pattern of the transducer. Thus one requires R,•zA/rra. Under this condi- tion, El• should be small. In order to insure that E2 is also small, the angular ate of change of the scattering amplitude must be bounded._Comparing Eqs. (24) and (25), this should occur when d (In .4 )/dO•kR, where the rate of change of F has been neglected. This condition implies that the flaw size is much less than that of the integration sphere and should also ensure that Els is small. Combining_these two condi- tions leads to the final condition that d (In .4 )/dO•(z/a). This is just the requirement, used originally in the derivation of Eq. (8), that the scattering amplitude vary slowly over the set of angles intercepted by the transducer. On physical grounds, it will be assumed that this condition generalizes to the two medium case. At this point, it should also be noted that the above are sufficient conditions for the application of Eq. (28). Because of the possiblity of phase cancellation in the error integrals, the necessary conditions may be more re- laxed. In summary, application of the reciprocity theorem has made it possible to specify the correct form of the first order, approximate relationship between unbounded medium scat- tering amplitudes and measurements made with finite trans- ducers through liquid-solid interfaces. A sufficient condi- tion for the approximation to be valid is that the illuminating wave be quasiplanar in the flaw vicinity and the scattering amplitude be slowly varying over the range of angles sub- tended by the receiving transducer. The form of the relation- ship between measurement and scattering amplitude does not depend on the Green's function for a particular interface shape. However, such a Green's function, or its equivalent, must be used in evaluating the factors denoted by C, which determine the velocity of the quasiplane wave illuminating the flaw. This, plus the experimental determination of the factor/•, will be the subject of the next two sections. C. Determination of the efficiency factor Application of Eq. (28) to experimental data requires knowledge of the factors/•, k, a, z, and a. It is assumed that the experimentalist will know, or can measure by standard techniques, the latter four factors. Tt can be found from stan- dard formulae. 38'39 This section deals with the experimental determination of "/•," while results of calculations of "C" for selected cases are summarized in the next section. As noted in Sec. IB,/• is a measure of the efficiency of the transducer. This is best determined experimentally since the performance of commercial ultrasonic transducers often deviates ubstantially from their theoretical idealizations. 4ø Such a calibration is generally performed in a reference x- periment, such as is shown in Fig. 4. For a single transducer, pulse-echo experiment, the beam from the transducer is re- flected from the planar back surface of a fiat plate. In a two- transducer experiment, the beam is transmitted through the reference plate. In either case, it will be assumed that the plate material has the same physical properties as the sample in which the scattering measurement is performed to sim- plify the calculations. The generalization is obvious. The major difficulty in the calibration procedure is the correction for diffraction effects. 33'41 The reference signal, FR, may be written in the form 1284 J. Acoust.

The results presented here show the absolute level of agreement between theory and experiment when the full measurement model [Eq. (32)] is used to predict un- bounded medium farfield scattering amplitudes from labo- ratory data. The samples used in these tests are illustrated in Fig. 6. The first, shown in Fig. 6(a), is a diffusion bonded disk of Ti- 6A1-4V alloy 2.54 cm thick which contains a 200 X 400 (semiaxes) oblate spheroidal cavity in the diffusion bond plane with the major axes parallel to the fiat disk surfaces. 46 The second sample, shown in Fig. 6(b), is a cast thermoplas- tic disk (Buehler's Transoptic) 1.13-cm thick containing a 114-/tm radius (by optical measurement) in-lead solder sphere 0.5 cm from one surface of the disk. All experiments were performed in a water immersion tank. For the titanium sample, L--.L backscattering mea- surements were made at normal incidence to the fiat surface of the disk using a 0.635-cm radius planar transducer with a nominal center frequency of 10 MHz. On the same sample, T-.Tbackscattered signals at a 20 ø incident angle (44.8 ø in solid) were obtained using a 0.635-cm radius planar trans- ducer with a nominal center frequency of 5 MHz. Longitudi- nal wave measurements inboth pulse-echo (backscatter) and pitch-catch mode were obtained from the plastic sample us- ing 0.3175-cm radius planar transducers with a nominal cen- ter frequency of 15 MHz. The experimental distances, an- gles, and related parameters are summarized in Table II. All transducers were Panametrics V-series (wideband)and were driven by a Panametrics 5052PR pulser-receiver. Signals were digitized and signal averaged either 64 (titanium sam- ple) or 256 (plastic sample) times using a Tektronix 7912AD programmable digitizer controlled by a Tektronix 4052 desktop computer. The longitudinal wave signals were sam- pled at a rate of 102.4 MHz and the transverse wave signals were sampled at a rate of 51.2 MHz. The digitized ultrasonic signals were selected from the measurement window by a rectangular gate controlled by the measurement software. For the plastic sample, the first and the second back-surface reflections were obtained to determine the ultrasonic attenu- (o) ß I' 10.16 cm 'l Ti-6AI-4V DISK (b) FIG. 6.

Let R l and R 2 denote the frequency spectra (computed by an FFT) of the first and second back-surface reflections, respectively, and D l and D 2 be the corresponding diffraction corrections [Eqs. (30)and (31)]. Then the attenu- ation in the solid is expressed as e a2d= R2Di/RiD2(Ri I , where R,• is the reflection coefficient at the solid-liquid in- terface, d is the thickness of the disk, and a is the ultrasonic attenuation per unit length. The attenuation a was modeled by a = aof n, (42) where fis frequency in MHz and the parameters ao and n were obtained by a least-squares fitof the fight-hand side of Eq. (41) to the left-hand side with a replaced by Eq. (42), for a range of frequencies within the transducer bandwidth (4-10 MHz). Values of ao and n obtained in these experiments are included in Table II. No correction for attenuation was made for data from the titanium sample due to low loss char- actedsties. Furthermore, effects of attenuation in the fluid medium were neglected since the pathszo,, Zoo, and Zo• were essentially equal for all cases. Signal processing of the scattered signals proceeded in the following manner. The gated time domain flaw and ref- erence signals were transformed to the frequency domain by the FFT, resulting in the quantities 6Fv and F• in Eq. (32). Let F• be defined by Eq. (32) as 6F v = FRA *, (43) so that/'R is the reference spectrum modified by the effects of diffraction, attenuation, transmission, refraction, and propagation of the ultrasonic waves. The interface coefficients "T" in Eq. (32) were calculat- ed as the standard velocity Fresnel transmission coefficients. The axial diffraction function C in Eq. (33) was computed by numerical integration of Eq. (36) by Simpsoh's approxima- tion with a sufficiently fine mesh to ensure at least three significant digit accuracy. The scattering amplitude •/* was finally estimated from the measured signals by 47 I + Q 2), (44) where the superscript '{' on/'• denotes complex conjugate and the constant Q alesensitizes this aleconvolution process to division by zeros in the reference spectrum. Note that when the transducer has a strong response, IF• I•'Q, and Eq. {44} reduces to Eq. {43). For all trials, Q was chosen to be 10% of the peak value of Irl. Transducer bandwidth for most trials was defined to be that range of frequencies for which I>Q- For the inclusion P/C data, the low-fre- quency cutoff was selected to avoid a large low-frequency overshoot whose origin was not fully determined. A sum- mary of all experimental parameters and the derived trans- mission coefficients and "S" parameters is included in Table II. The values of Sref shown in the last column are based on one-half of the total ultrasonic path. The value of $ used in Eq. {31} is equal to twice this value. 1286 J. Acoust. Soc.

ABSOLUTE COMPARISON OF THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL SCATTERING AMPLITUDES The theoretical data to be presented is from three sources. First, magnitude and phase of the L--•L scattering amplitude for the oblate spheroidal cavity were obtained from numerical calculation by the method of optimal trun- cation {MOOT). 48 The magnitude of the scattering ampli- tude for T--,.T backscatter from the spheroidal cavity was computed via the T-matrix method. 49 Finally, phase and magnitude of the scattering amplitudes for the various cat- tering cases for the spherical inclusion were obtained from an eigenfunction expansion of the elastic wave scattering from a spherical object. so In all cases, the theoretical quanti- ties were expressed as functions ofk•av where ks is the wave- number for the scattered wave mode and aF is the flaw radius {semimajor axis for the oblate spheroid). Thus to present comparisons between theoretical and experimental data, the radius of the scatterer had to be specified. This was adjusted to produce the best fit, in terms of the frequencies ofoccur- rence of the resonant structure, between the theoretical and experimental magnitudes. The adjusted values were a F = 380/tm for L---•L scattering from the spheroid, aF = 1 19 /tm for scattering from the spherical inclusion. Thus this adjustment was less than 5% in all cases. In addition, for comparisons of phase, the deduced ex- perimental scattering amplitudes were multiplied by a phase 1287 J. Acoust. Soc.

The experimental data to follow are shown only for the range of frequencies within the reference bandwidth for the particular experiment. Results from the titanium sample of Fig. 6(a} are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 for the cases of L--,.L backscatter at normal incidence to the disk surface and of T--•Tbackseatter at a 20 ø incident angle relative to the surface normal (44.8 ø in solid}, respectively.

In Fig. 8, only the magnitude of the scattering amplitude is shown since theoretical phase information was not available. Once again, the solid line is the theoretical curve and the dashed line is the experimental case which showed the best agree- ment to the data. Considerable variability was observed in the detected flaw signals for the T-•T measurements de- pending upon the azimuthal angle of attack on the spheroid, which may indicate either imperfect matching of the two halves of the sample in the diffusion bonding process or ex- cessive graininess in the bond plane at the juncture of the halves of the spheroid. However, even the "worst case" data, shown as a dotted line in Fig. 8, is quite close to theoretical curve in magnitude except for an extraneous minima at f • 5.5 MHz. Comparisons between theoretical and experimental re- sults for backscattering (pulse-echo) from the spherical in- clusion of Fig. 6(b) are shown in Fig. 9, in which the theoreti- cal curves are shown as solid lines. Two experimental data sets are also presented--one for normal incidence upon the sample surface (dashed lines) and one for a 15.7 ø incident angle (30 ø in the solid) relative to the surface normal Idotted lines). The phase comparisons are quite good for the band- width under consideration, and the magnitude comparison is good except for the high-frequency end of the spectrum. This disagreement may be due to inadequacy of the simple attenuation model in Eq. (42). In particular, the attenuation model was fit only to the range of frequencies 4.<f< 10 MHz for which the model Eq. (42) closely matched the data.

Illumipation was at nor- mal incidence and reception at an 8 ø angle (15 ø in solid). higher frequencies, the amplitudes of the spectra of the re- flected signals used in the attenuation calculation were so reduced that effects of noise could be significant. Finally, Figs. 10-13 show the results of pitch-catch ex- periments in which the illuminating transducer was oriented normal to the disk surface and the receiving transducer was oriented at the sequence of angles 8 ø, 15.7 ø, 22.5 ø, and 27.9 ø relative to the surface normal (15 ø, 30 ø, 45 ø, 60 ø in the solid). Once again, the agreement between theoretical {solid lines) and experimental {dashed lines) phase is quite good although there is a fairly systematic deviation between theoretical and experimental magnitudes that increases with greater scatter- ing angle. However, keeping in mind that these are absolute comparisons, the overall agreement is quite satisfactory. Preliminary comparisons to experiment 3ø have also been performed for propagation through cylindrical sur- faces. These experiments were performed at 10 MHz in ti- tanium samples which had a radius of surface curvature of 8.8 cm. The flaw was a spherical void. Angular variations rather than absolute comparisons were reported and only the approximate form for Co, given in Eq. (37), was available for computation. Good agreement between theory and ex- periment were observed for longitudinal waves propagating at internal angles 0, ranging from 0 ø to 35 ø. For greater an- gles, disagreement occurred, but for those cases, the require- ment AS/S< 1 in Eq. {37) was violated. Hence, further effort is required to evaluate the limits of the theory in the cylindri- cal interface case.

DISCUSSION An approximate model has been derived which relates unbounded medium scattering amplitudes to ultrasonic scattering measurements made through liquid-solid nter- faces. The model assumes that the illuminating fields are quasiplanar over the volume of the flaw and that he scatter- ing amplitude is slowly varying over the set of angles sub- tended at the flaw by the transducer. Included are correc- tions for the effects of diffraction, refraction, and mode conversion at the liquid-solid interface, and attenuation. The error terms in the model are formally identified. The theory was tested by using it to deduce the magni- tude and phase of both L--•L and T-•T scattering ampli- tudes from measurements through planar liquid-solid inter- faces. The good absolute agreement between the results and theoretical expectations supports the validity of the ap- proach. Preliminary esults, reported elsewhere, forpropa- gation through cylindrical surfaces, were also cited. More work is needed to establish the precise limits at which the formalism breaks down for that case. Since the model provides a direct link between experi- mental observations in finite geometries and theoretical cal- culations in unbounded media, it should prove useful in the interpretation of ondestructive evaluation experiments. In preliminary work, it has been found to be useful in correcting for systematic measurement rrors in inverse scattering ex- periments 28 and in computing the probability of detecting flaws in various noise environments. 29-3• Future applica- tions may include the use of absolute scattering amplitudes in determining compositions offlaws.
